1
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,980
If I'm not here,

2
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,740
You'll have to laugh like this.

3
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,180
I've only few friends.

4
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,080
To live in this world,

5
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,880
you need social life.

6
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,380
You know his schedule that well?

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,460
I'm in a hurry.

8
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,660
I want a chance to join the band.

9
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,180
Opportunity and ability

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,920
Always come together.

11
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,920
Not everyone gets that opportunity.

12
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,420
But if you want to observe our club,

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,580
I'll allow you specially.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,980
Well.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,880
Are you ready?

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,180
1...2...

17
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,720
Um...

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
You can sit here as long as you want.

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,220
Thank you so much.

20
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,200
Hey.

21
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,500
Your face says it all.

22
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,380
What's up?

23
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,720
Are you free?

24
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,400
If you're free,

25
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
then be my partner.

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,740
Sure.

27
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,300
I'll make you beg for me to stop.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
And you.

29
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,660
Be our referee.

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,420
Me?

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,060
Yes, you.

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,680
Weird.

33
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Ready?

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,380
Yeah.

35
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,120
If I win,

36
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,060
I want you for one day.

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,460
For what?

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,340
No need to know.

39
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,440
Okay.

40
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,200
On guard.

41
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,820
Ready.

42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,140
Go.

43
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,140
You really need to win?

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,140
Shut up.

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,880
Come!

46
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,420
Don't want to be with me that much?

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,960
Stop whining.

48
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,080
Hey!

49
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,120
That's enough!

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360
What the hell?

51
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
Loser shouldn't whine.

52
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,040
That I said if I win,

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,340
I want you for one day

54
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,580
was just a joke!

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,360
Are you crazy?

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,220
You're crazy.

57
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm just annoyed.

58
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,500
By whom?

59
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,740
Tell me.

60
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,980
Myself.

61
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,520
Calm down.

62
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,920
Talk to him later.

63
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,100
Well done!

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,900
Good job.

65
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,740
You understand harmony well.

66
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,760
Remember

67
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,060
that every instrument

68
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,940
has its own duty.

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,840
Though different in sound,

70
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
different in pitches,

71
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,320
but when in ensemble

72
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,760
to perform their own duty to their best,

73
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,200
they will blend together

74
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,080
to create one melody,

75
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,740
and that's

76
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,080
harmony.

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Get it?

78
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,900
Yes, prof.

79
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,260
Okay.

80
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,660
I have something to tell you all.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,540
Our club

82
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,620
may have to perform

83
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,820
for the rugby match closing ceremony

84
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,560
next week.

85
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,880
Wow.

86
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,080
Prof.

87
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,840
Do we have enough time

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,920
to prepare for the performance?

89
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
It's quite challenging,

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,640
so I haven't accepted to proposal yet.

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,520
But after watching your performance today,

92
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,100
I think it's easy to decide.

93
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,220
You mean

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,240
we'll get to perform?

95
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,000
Think you can do it?

96
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,580
Sure thing!

97
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,460
We'll rehearse rigorously.

98
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,080
We won't disappoint you.

99
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,740
Right, guys?

100
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah.

101
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,840
Absolutely.

102
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,060
Great.

103
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,560
You need to do your best.

104
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,860
Tomorrow we will choose

105
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,740
which song we will perform.

106
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,660
Okay?

107
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes.

108
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,880
Okay.

109
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,380
Toy, we'll rehearse this song today.

110
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,240
And after this song,

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,920
go take a break.

112
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,060
Yes, prof.

113
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,780
Okay, everyone. Ready.

114
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,860
1...2...

115
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,160
Damn.

116
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm doomed.

117
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,200
Hey.

118
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,640
What's wrong?

119
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,720
Tell me what’s wrong.

120
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,020
Apples.

121
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,780
I need apples.

122
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,640
Give me apples.

123
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,680
Does it really help?

124
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,640
What else can I do?

125
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,300
It's okay.

126
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,480
It helps.

127
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,440
Hey.

128
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,080
Eat them all.

129
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,220
I cleaned them for you.

130
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,660
Kim.

131
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,180
Kim!

132
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,960
Wait here.

133
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,120
Just a minute.

134
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,020
Kim!

135
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,600
What?

136
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,660
Why are you here?

137
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,380
Everyone's waiting for you.

138
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh.

139
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,600
Okay.

140
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,440
I'll be there.

141
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
Eat them all.

142
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,300
And wait here.

143
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,460
Don't go anywhere.

144
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,760
I'll be back.

145
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,740
Wait here!

146
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,020
I'll come for you.

147
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,180
Get in.

148
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,620
I can go home by myself.

149
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,180
I'll drive you home.

150
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,500
Or you're afraid?

151
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,980
This Sun

152
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,980
is never scared of anything.

153
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,565
I'm sorry for an abrupt meeting.

154
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:23,905
Don't worry.

155
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:26,625
I hope there's good news.

156
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:28,585
Well,

157
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:32,365
There's a villa on sale secretly

158
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,305
in the northern province
in the middle of the valley .

159
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,845
The former owner was a foreigner
who plans to retire and live here.

160
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,865
But he's passed away before retirement.

161
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,845
What kind?

162
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,405
Cardiac arrest.

163
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:47,545
Er...

164
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,705
I mean what kind of villa.

165
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,425
Oh.

166
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,505
Speak of the devil.

167
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,145
Here's the villa.

168
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,065
Thank you.

169
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,705
Beautiful.

170
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,025
Perfect.

171
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:12,085
Both architect and stylist are from D-house.

172
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,465
Very good taste.

173
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:18,245
Do you want to know the price?

174
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:11,465
What's the rush?

175
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,945
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,165
For the solo part,

177
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,125
Kim and Tew

178
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:20,685
must perform duet.

179
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:23,725
It's the highlight of this song.

180
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,185
You need to be more in sync, okay?

181
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:28,825
Yes, prof.

182
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:33,885
Okay.

183
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:35,505
That's it for today.

184
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,365
Seems like someone's in a hurry.

185
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:41,265
Dismiss.

186
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,045
What?

187
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,205
Kim.

188
00:16:59,005 --> 00:16:59,905
How are you?

189
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:00,865
Well...

190
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:02,885
I'm better now.

191
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,085
Are you sure?

192
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:14,245
Yeah.

193
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:31,625
Hurry up.

194
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:33,605
What?

195
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,945
I'll drive you home.

196
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,125
I don't want anyone to collapse here.

197
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,165
If you're fine, then follow me.

198
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:45,845
Can't you say something nice?

199
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:47,945
I've been waiting and thought

200
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:50,525
you'd talk to professor about me joining the club.

201
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:53,145
Such a meanie.

202
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,245
Your help today

203
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,885
means our debt is done.

204
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,045
I can go home by myself.

205
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,105
Good! Nice!

206
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,665
You're new here.

207
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:24,765
Get used to his fame.

208
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:25,585
That guy

209
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,165
is our team captain

210
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:29,505
named Rain.

211
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,145
Shain.

212
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,205
Rain, not Shain.

213
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:36,765
Yeah.

214
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,205
I just mix his name with mine.

215
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,805
I'm Shun.

216
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,265
Shun and Rain.

217
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:43,565
So it's Shain.

218
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:00,545
Nice!

219
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,085
Good job!

220
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,165
I'll check our schedule,

221
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,445
and make an appointment

222
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,065
for the tour of that villa.

223
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,165
The sooner the better.

224
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,985
I want to see the beauty with my own eyes.

225
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:23,965
Sure.

226
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,525
I'll be hurry.

227
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,885
I'll excuse myself.

228
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,445
Goodbye.

229
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:31,225
Thank you.

230
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:54,685
What?

231
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:56,105
Get in.

232
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,165
No!

233
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:05,185
I said get in.

234
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,105
And I said no!

235
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:08,745
I can go home by myself.

236
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:11,025
Don't feel guilty.

237
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:12,785
How can you go by yourself.

238
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,665
Your condition was that bad.

239
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,205
What if it happens again?

240
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,785
I'm fine!

241
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:37,785
Are you angry?

242
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:39,645
Oh, you can be nice.

243
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,205
Get in the car.

244
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:42,745
I'm just driving you home.

245
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:44,485
Or you're scared?

246
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:46,545
No way.

247
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,565
This Sun

248
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,665
is never scared of anything.

249
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:53,065
Get in the car.

250
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,285
What now?

251
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:06,745
What?

252
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,205
You'll think I steal your car.

253
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:11,525
And get mad again.

254
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:13,245
What?

255
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:15,725
You watched too many dramas?

256
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,125
Hey!

257
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:21,805
What are you doing?

258
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:23,845
Stop whining.

259
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,685
I don't want to be fined.

260
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,365
You must follow the rules.

261
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:33,445
Just say it.

262
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:37,925
What?

263
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,085
It's nothing.

264
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:45,105
Where?

265
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,365
Where's your home?

266
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:52,365
Good View condo. Soi Tonson 13.

267
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:09,965
Stronger!

268
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,885
Gather around!

269
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,025
You're here as I thought.

270
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:53,125
Well...

271
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,285
What can I do for you?

272
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:57,605
Nothing.

273
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,205
I'm fine today.

274
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,585
No injury. No need to worry.

275
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:07,205
Don't believe me?

276
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,165
Wanna check?

277
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,045
Er...

278
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:14,565
I don't have to go that far.

279
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:17,485
Just kidding!

280
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:20,985
You should go.

281
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:22,905
Thanks for coming.

282
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:25,405
Okay.

283
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:27,845
It's my duty.

284
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:31,825
Don't come tomorrow.

285
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,285
Go make yourself happy.

286
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:44,645
Uh...

287
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:45,625
Mr. Rain.

288
00:24:58,745 --> 00:24:59,545
Payoo.

289
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:02,625
Such a coincidence.

290
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:05,565
Rehearsal’s over?

291
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:06,745
Yeah.

292
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:12,345
Kim's already gone home.

293
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:15,245
He's fine today. No fight with anyone.

294
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:17,405
Great.

295
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:20,565
Are you going home now?

296
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,005
I'll walk you to your car.

297
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:23,405
Well...

298
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:24,885
It's okay.

299
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:27,965
I go that way too.

300
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:54,585
We arrived?

301
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:56,505
Wait.

302
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:57,925
What are you doing?

303
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,991
I think I've met him before.

304
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:50,631
We arrived?

305
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,511
How can you sleep?

306
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:55,851
Hey!

307
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:57,511
You.

308
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,231
Don't!

309
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,891
Don't even think!

310
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:02,771
Who'd have known

311
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,251
when I'd go asleep?

312
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:06,031
I can't control it.

313
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:08,691
Really?

314
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:11,331
If you drive me here only to complain,

315
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:12,751
don't ever do it again.

316
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,491
I didn't ask for it.

317
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:15,631
Hey.

318
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,051
I haven't complained at all.

319
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:22,991
What are you doing?

320
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:24,491
Wait.

321
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:25,631
Let me go.

322
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:26,311
Hey.

323
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:27,911
Shut up.

324
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:42,671
You!

325
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:44,151
What!

326
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:56,151
Release the belt.

327
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:02,071
Thanks.

328
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:04,431
Bye.

329
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:22,791
Forgot something?

330
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:25,131
What?

331
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,411
Text me your account number.

332
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:30,411
I'll return what I owed you.

333
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:32,511
I don't wanna be in your debt.

334
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,571
And...

335
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,231
Don't text me if nothing's serious.

336
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,191
I get annoyed easily.

337
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:41,291
I know.

338
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:42,751
It's evident.

339
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:35,311
Crap.

340
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:41,071
I forgot.

341
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:49,331
It's about to rain.

342
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,631
But I could make it.

343
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:06,751
Damn.

344
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:09,231
It rains.

345
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:41,571
Oh.

346
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:43,631
Out of stock.

347
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,371
What now...

348
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:48,491
Hey.

349
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,631
Apple's out of stock today.

350
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:54,311
You're not usually this late.

351
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,251
I just finished my classes.

352
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:57,431
I see.

353
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:58,291
Then,

354
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:01,371
You should come again in the morning for new ones.

355
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:04,091
Thank you.

356
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:08,031
I should be fine tonight.

357
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:08,871
Thank you.

358
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,131
I told you.

359
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,391
Don't text me if nothing's serious.

360
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,611
Get it?

361
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:24,811
I just want to thank you.

362
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,111
You zombie!

363
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,231
Sun,

364
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:51,771
Happy Birthday, my dear.

365
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,831
I didn't forget.

366
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,631
I was just so busy with work yesterday.

367
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,051
I wanted to call you,
 but I know it's not the right time.

368
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:01,931
L.A. timezone is so different from yours.

369
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,571
Oh, dad also wishes you a happy birthday.

370
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:05,791
Thank you, mom.

371
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,831
Don't worry too much about my birthday.

372
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,451
I know how busy you are.

373
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:13,171
And...

374
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:15,211
Are you feeling fine?

375
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,551
I'm fine.

376
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,731
Don't worry.

377
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,511
I go to see doctors regularly.

378
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:21,871
Take medicine

379
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,011
regularly.

380
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:24,691
And...

381
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:27,851
You always have apples with you, right?

382
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:31,711
Yes.

383
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,431
Thank you for your advice.

384
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:38,351
It makes me feel safe

385
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,691
and makes me think about you.

386
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:42,591
Sure, son.

387
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:46,971
And this condo

388
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:48,851
is very comfortable.

389
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:51,451
You don't have to worry at all.

390
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,691
It's near my new university too.

391
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,211
Have you got into the music club yet?

392
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,151
Did you make a lot of friends?

393
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,071
You must have been fun, right?

394
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:06,751
I'm really worried about you.

395
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:10,451
I worry about you the most.

396
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:12,551
You know?

397
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:15,931
Yes, I know.

398
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:18,671
I know what you did for me.

399
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:23,051
I'll get stronger as soon as I can.

400
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:24,991
So we can stay together again.

401
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,071
I'll graduate in one year.

402
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,131
Am I a good son?

403
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:32,791
Right.

404
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,711
Absolutely.

405
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,271
Sun.

406
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:41,651
My reason in the past might be a little...

407
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:42,511
Mom!

408
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,791
I know you did it for me.

409
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,231
Not everything

410
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:49,651
needs an explanation.

411
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,571
People might say you're too superstitious

412
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:56,371
that you let your sister adopt me

413
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,311
or even have to go far away from me.

414
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,371
But I know how you feel.

415
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,111
Thank you.

416
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:07,031
Thank you, my dear.

417
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:08,851
You're alone.

418
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,591
So you need to take care of your health.

419
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,351
You know?

420
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:16,671
Sure, mom.

421
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:22,191
Goodbye.

422
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,411
Goodbye.

423
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:56,711
Someone told me

424
00:36:58,811 --> 00:36:59,951
if you're lonely

425
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:04,431
or sad,

426
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:08,551
go out for a run.

427
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:11,871
Turn your tear into sweat,

428
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,671
so you'll cry less.

429
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:32,971
Thank you about last night.

430
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:33,911
What happened?

431
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:35,851
Tell me.

432
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:37,931
We...

433
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:39,771
Kissed.

434
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:40,731
What!?

435
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:58,043
This team's fullback is very strong.

436
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,623
You can't win against them with just sheer force.

437
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,123
We need tactics.

438
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,623
Get it?

439
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:06,763
Yes, coach.

440
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:07,903
Mr. Rain.

441
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:09,303
Mr. Rain.

442
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:11,883
Mr. Rain.

443
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,363
Again.

444
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,223
You sleep in my room again.

445
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,403
You should go back to your room.

446
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:30,343
No.

447
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,163
I'm still sleepy.

448
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:34,143
Too lazy to go upstairs.

449
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:39,303
Close the curtain.

450
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:40,923
Lights are blinding.

451
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,343
As always.

452
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:48,883
I have to be at the training camp,

453
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,423
so I want to sleep everywhere in this house.

454
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,243
As you wish.

455
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,303
Rain.

456
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:35,983
Rain!

457
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:37,503
Yes, coach.

458
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:38,503
What's wrong?

459
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:41,703
Nothing.

460
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:43,043
Just thinking.

461
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:45,443
You bait the fullback up here

462
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:46,623
while Tony

463
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:49,463
waits behind for scissors.

464
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:51,943
Centers will realize and replace the fullback.

465
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,243
But it'll be too late.

466
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,803
Because Tony will do scissors while Rain scores a try.

467
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,063
Boom!

468
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:02,483
And Rain's a superstar again.

469
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:03,643
While I

470
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:05,483
am just a decoy.

471
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,383
Great!

472
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:09,583
In some games,

473
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:11,863
Rain needs to be a decoy,

474
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:13,543
or they'll know our drill.

475
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:15,223
Yes, coach.

476
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:18,823
I can do anything for our team.

477
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:19,803
Nice.

478
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:21,763
You all did well today.

479
00:40:21,763 --> 00:40:22,563
Get some rest.

480
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:23,983
See you at 5 A.M.

481
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:25,703
Yes, coach.

482
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:29,603
Rain.

483
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,043
Hi.

484
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:34,063
My name is Shun.

485
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:36,463
Yes, Shun.

486
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:38,703
Can I have a word with you?

487
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:41,403
Rain.

488
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:43,383
I'll go to bed.

489
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:44,323
Okay.

490
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,683
About what?

491
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:56,943
Rain.

492
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,703
I joined this club.

493
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,263
Because of you.

494
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:03,543
No.

495
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,203
You just love rugby,

496
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:12,143
Right?

497
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:17,143
Yeah.

498
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:18,863
Right.

499
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:22,343
You're a part of the team now.

500
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:23,763
Do you best.

501
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:34,203
Rain.

502
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:36,363
Are you sleepy?

503
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:38,303
Not at all.

504
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:40,703
But the rule said

505
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:42,923
it's bedtime.

506
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:44,583
Rules are rules.

507
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:46,723
Okay.

508
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:58,623
But I...

509
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,483
love to break the rules.

510
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,463
Hello.

511
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,963
My code-nephew.

512
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,503
So gorgeous.

513
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:31,003
This must be the whims of fate

514
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:36,283
that my code-nephew is in faculty of fine arts.

515
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,623
Hey, auntie.

516
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,243
If you didn't take a year off,

517
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,103
you wouldn't be his code-aunt.

518
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:43,843
Auntie,

519
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:46,123
this is male locker room.

520
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:48,023
Oh, really?

521
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,563
I just want to tell you about a welcome party tonight.

522
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:52,803
Hey,

523
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,863
he's confused now.

524
00:42:57,343 --> 00:42:59,243
Why confused?

525
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:03,923
You, Sun with ID code 65141001.

526
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:07,563
Even though you transferred here in the 3rd year,

527
00:43:07,743 --> 00:43:11,103
your id code that’s supposed to be

528
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:16,263
in economics turned into fine arts.

529
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:20,063
So here's your code-brother

530
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:23,923
His name is Rain.

531
00:43:24,283 --> 00:43:27,703
641410001.

532
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,223
You need to invite him to our party.

533
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:32,983
Me?

534
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:34,223
Yes.

535
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:35,723
It's our custom.

536
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:37,443
Younger code-brother

537
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:39,623
must invite older code-brother.

538
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:40,543
Go.

539
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,443
Bring him to me.

540
00:43:46,663 --> 00:43:49,843
My code-family isn't that active.

541
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:52,123
I've been here for 3 years

542
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:54,363
but only met them twice.

543
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:57,243
I've never met my code-family.

544
00:43:57,743 --> 00:43:58,503
Right.

545
00:43:58,863 --> 00:44:01,243
You never care about anything anyway.

546
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:02,423
So different from me.

547
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:05,123
I don't think it's that important.

548
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:07,663
If it's not,

549
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:10,883
it couldn't be a custom.

550
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:13,323
Hey.

551
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:18,903
Thank you for last night.

552
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:22,203
It's nothing.

553
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:23,743
Wait.

554
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:25,783
Last night.

555
00:44:27,663 --> 00:44:28,683
What happened?

556
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:30,603
Tell me.

557
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:32,523
Oh.

558
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:35,323
Well... We...

559
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,903
both

560
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:39,783
kissed.

561
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:40,303
What?!

562
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:43,283
Kissed?

563
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:46,123
Did you two kiss?

564
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,583
Don't tell me...

565
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:49,243
No!

566
00:44:50,643 --> 00:44:51,743
That's not true.

567
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:52,863
Just kidding.

568
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:55,483
That's not funny.

569
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,623
That's right.

570
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,083
I'm very happy

571
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:00,363
that you will have a lover.

572
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:01,403
- Hey!
- Hey!

573
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:03,183
I'm surprised!

574
00:45:03,943 --> 00:45:05,523
If I didn't say that,

575
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,803
you wouldn't care to listen.

576
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,063
Your idea sucks.

577
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:11,963
I was just kidding.

578
00:45:12,683 --> 00:45:14,683
Why so serious?

579
00:45:15,403 --> 00:45:16,683
I'm not your playmate.

580
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:18,283
Hey.

581
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,243
Too harsh.

582
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:21,723
Yeah.

583
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:23,463
Are you insane?

584
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:26,263
When you're good, it's great.

585
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:28,403
But when you're bad, you're awful.

586
00:45:28,403 --> 00:45:29,483
Stop it!

587
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,023
If you don't,

588
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:32,763
my world

589
00:45:33,403 --> 00:45:34,483
will no longer have you.

590
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:38,563
So,

591
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:41,683
You can forget me that easily?

592
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,143
Yes.

593
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:47,283
Forget the person you deeply care about

594
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,443
just a few hours ago?

595
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:53,523
Yes!

596
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:56,743
I think I'm in the way.

597
00:45:57,303 --> 00:45:58,523
I should go.

598
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:08,943
I'm mad.

599
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:10,923
And?

600
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,223
I'll get revenge.

601
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:21,843
I don't care.

602
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:29,763
I'll force myself into your world.

603
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,363
You'll never forget about me.

604
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:37,903
In your dreams!

605
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:01,563
I found someone to cure your boredom.

606
00:47:01,563 --> 00:47:02,723
If you bring him to me,

607
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:04,123
I'll punch him.

608
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:05,803
You won't.

609
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,483
Is that the plant you'll grow here?

610
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:10,303
Yeah.

611
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:12,043
Apple tree.

612
00:47:17,243 --> 00:47:17,603
Crap!
