1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,390
Today...

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,200
is the day that couple comets

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,320
will return to each other after 70 years.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,760
I wished that what you wished

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,820
will be granted.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,980
I wished for my brother's safety.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,820
Finally,

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,930
we met.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,560
Rain!

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,680
Payoo's taken care of me this past 3 months.

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,260
I'm sorry, Master Kim.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,300
I didn't tell you about this.

13
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,360
Just wait a bit more.

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,780
They'll pay for what they did.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,240
Itty bitty!

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,880
Bigfoot.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,940
I can't believe

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,320
I finally found you.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,790
It's all thank to that Youtube video from 3 years ago

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,290
that you talked about red sneakers.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,760
That means...

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,170
You transferred here in your 3rd year

23
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,380
because of that?

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah.

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,000
It might sound

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,810
irrational.

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,600
But the childhood memory that can surpass everything

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,940
is hard to find.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,620
One in a million.

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,730
Right?

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,040
How about guitar?

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,640
You love it?

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,170
It's the only thing that connects me with you.

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,630
You...

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,780
play it without loving it.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,250
Is that possible?

37
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,220
No.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,260
I have to thank you

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,470
for making me learn to play it.

40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,180
I have it as my friend

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,990
in joy and in sorrow.

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,330
I love it.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,260
Great.

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,830
I appreciate what you did for me.

45
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,260
But I...

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
I've never done anything for you.

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,620
Thank you.

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,680
What I did...

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,320
includes your scar on your arm?

50
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,210
This?

51
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,500
Someone

52
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,560
is destined to just wait.

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,000
But someone

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,370
is destined to search the world.

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,070
And that is...

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
Kim!

57
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,880
What is it?

58
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,460
It is...

59
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,430
What?

60
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,670
What?

61
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,850
It's...

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,490
It's...

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,100
KimSun.

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,130
Won't you

65
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,820
forget about me?

66
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,850
Then...

67
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,010
I'll make you

68
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,500
unable to forget me.

69
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,800
What's with the phone?

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,590
Sun.

71
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,530
Listen.

72
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,330
If one day

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,090
this Kim forgets about you,

74
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
please tell him

75
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,900
that today

76
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,270
is his happiest day of life.

77
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,220
Because...

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,410
He's found the one he loves

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,650
whom he's been searching for.

80
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,170
Promise me.

81
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,640
What?

82
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,880
Promise that you'll tell Kim.

83
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,320
I promise.

84
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,100
Okay?

85
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,380
Kim.

86
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,600
It's not an accident.

87
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,530
It's a murder attempt.

88
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,300
Kim.

89
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,420
Who are you?

90
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,620
How did you get in my room?

91
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,320
Hey.

92
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,580
What happened?

93
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,100
I said what happened?!

94
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,730
Nothing.

95
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,310
Nothing happened.

96
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,310
Nothing?

97
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,650
Then what's this?

98
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:29,960
Hey?

99
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,880
Kim.

100
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,710
Listen to me.

101
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,780
My name is Kimhan.

102
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,060
I order you

103
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,940
to leave this room!

104
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,440
Promise me.

105
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,040
What?

106
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,280
Promise that you'll tell Kim.

107
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,700
I promise.

108
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,550
Okay?

109
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,420
I'm sorry.

110
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,470
I couldn't keep that promise.

111
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,650
Because it means nothing now.

112
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm sorry, Sun.

113
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,370
I'm sorry.

114
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,740
It's that kid!

115
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,940
He'll be useful for us.

116
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,531
Hey, Sun.

117
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,341
Where were you last night?

118
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:30,781
Don't tell me

119
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,771
you're going home?

120
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,081
How will you get out of here?

121
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:44,941
Are you crazy?

122
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,891
I'll just leave.

123
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,921
And find a way later.

124
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,401
Want to go with me?

125
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,301
Sun.

126
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,791
Calm down.

127
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,511
You're hesitating.

128
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,351
I'll go now.

129
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,411
Sun.

130
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,871
Wait!

131
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:13,941
Wow.

132
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:15,261
I can't believe

133
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:18,381
my wish upon those comets was granted this quickly.

134
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:22,831
Just drink it.

135
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,661
So sweet.

136
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:29,391
Sun!

137
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:30,291
Sun!

138
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,831
Wait, Sun!

139
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,021
Shun.

140
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,551
What happened?

141
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't know.

142
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,491
Last night,

143
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:41,171
Sun didn't return to the room.

144
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,381
This morning,

145
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:43,881
he packed his bag,

146
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,121
and said he'll go home.

147
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,201
How's he going home?

148
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:49,481
He's gone.

149
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,591
How long till we get there?

150
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,041
In about 15 minutes, ma'am.

151
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:23,821
Master Kim.

152
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:27,061
Practicing archery?

153
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:38,301
Payoo.

154
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,611
Let's get everyone out of here.

155
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,241
Right now,

156
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,281
it's too dangerous for everyone.

157
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,161
We should immediately send them home.

158
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:54,541
Okay.

159
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:55,791
Right.

160
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,351
I want everyone to leave now.

161
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,411
Why, Payoo?

162
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:25,541
Yeah.

163
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:26,631
What's wrong?

164
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:29,651
For your own safety,

165
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,281
I want you all to leave immediately.

166
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,271
How about Sun?

167
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:55,551
It's okay.

168
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,871
I'll take care of him.

169
00:19:58,741 --> 00:19:59,081
Shun.

170
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:00,511
Baibua.

171
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:02,101
Tony.

172
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:03,421
Toy.

173
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:05,191
Pie.

174
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:06,361
Petch.

175
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:08,041
Oh.

176
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,471
Don't worry.

177
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:11,181
Wow.

178
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:12,751
That's crazy.

179
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:13,741
So...

180
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:15,791
You remember us all.

181
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,661
Yeah.

182
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:20,791
Why did you pretend to forget us?

183
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:21,481
Yeah.

184
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:23,811
Kim.

185
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:25,141
What's wrong?

186
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:27,301
I did it

187
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,481
for your safety.

188
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:31,701
Because...

189
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,371
It's life-and-death situation.

190
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,831
Including Sun?

191
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:37,831
Yeah.

192
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,231
I'll search for Sun too.

193
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:43,581
Okay.

194
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:44,791
Let's go.

195
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,271
If I have to come here,

196
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,791
why should I hire you?

197
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,341
I'm sorry, boss.

198
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,351
I had to take a stand.

199
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,471
I won't tolerate it anymore.

200
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:25,951
Sun!

201
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:46,531
What?

202
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,651
I told you not to call me if it's not an emergency.

203
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:54,861
Police and Market Surveillance Department are in your room now.

204
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,241
What happened?

205
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,691
They're notified about money laundering and trading violations

206
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,951
by committing insider trading.

207
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:06,691
Impossible!

208
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,231
I bought those stocks at market price.

209
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,081
From their documents,

210
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:15,321
you bought stocks from our own board of directors by concealing the source.

211
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,201
Our board of directors?

212
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,591
Let me talk to those guys.

213
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,461
Ma'am, it's our president.

214
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:25,941
Hello.

215
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,071
What are you doing?

216
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:32,511
I have to seize all of your stocks to investigate.

217
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:34,901
You can request an appeal

218
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,401
along with evidence.

219
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,001
Whose stocks are violated?

220
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,801
Mr. Wasan Kannakul.

221
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:47,281
The board member of Kannakul Group Co., Ltd.

222
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,291
That's impossible.

223
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,191
What the hell are you talking about?

224
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:56,121
I'm Wasan Kannakul.

225
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,601
I hold 26% stake in Kannakul Group.

226
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,711
And with transfer of share from my brother,

227
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,881
Mr. Kimhan Kannakul who hold 25% stake,

228
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,561
I now hold 51% stake.

229
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:11,141
I'll exercise my right as a major shareholder

230
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:12,841
to administrate Kannakul Group

231
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:15,751
as a new CEO.

232
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,871
Are there any objections?

233
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,281
I approve.

234
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,861
Then I'll hold an urgent meeting

235
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:31,871
with an agenda of the wrongdoings by our former CEO,

236
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,681
Dr. Sookwan.

237
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,681
She made our Kannakul Group suffer damage

238
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,821
in both investment fund and reputation.

239
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,381
I, as an authority,

240
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,161
rightfully use my rights

241
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:49,061
to remove our former CEO as of now.

242
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:50,991
Please

243
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:54,161
sign your approval

244
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:56,581
in the documents in front of you.

245
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:17,741
You goddamn punk!

246
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:20,501
This time

247
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:24,341
you'll be dead for real.

248
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,501
I think we should split up.

249
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,111
You go there.

250
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:04,151
I'll go this way.

251
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:05,791
And then...

252
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:08,631
We'll meet at the open space beside the waterfall.

253
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,601
Okay, Payoo.

254
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,141
Drive faster!

255
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,751
I can't wait to deal with them!

256
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:32,311
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:45,181
Stop!

258
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:49,961
It's that kid.

259
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:51,401
What should we do?

260
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:54,641
He's important to Kimhan.

261
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,151
He'll be useful for us.

262
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,161
Sun!

263
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:05,161
Sun!

264
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:07,991
Sun, Where are you?

265
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:09,491
Sun!

266
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,181
Where are you?

267
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:14,951
Sun!

268
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,341
Sun, can you hear me?

269
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:25,091
Sun!

270
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:29,091
Kim!

271
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,111
Kim!

272
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,381
Hey, kiddo.

273
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:56,921
Doctor.

274
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,021
Help me.

275
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,261
I'm Sun.

276
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,151
Kim's friend.

277
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:09,141
Kimhan?

278
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,841
A person without privilege

279
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:17,781
should call him Kimhan.

280
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,031
What can I do for you?

281
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:33,551
I...I can't breathe.

282
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,681
That won't do.

283
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:42,831
You can't die here.

284
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:49,311
Sun!

285
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,241
Sun!

286
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:58,771
You're useful for me

287
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,711
and for Kimhan.

288
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:04,611
Doctor...

289
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:07,651
Help me.

290
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:10,951
Sure thing.

291
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:14,371
Grab him!

292
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,761
I'm sorry, bro.

293
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,621
Yong. Aem.

294
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:20,981
What are you doing?

295
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:22,361
Let me go!

296
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:23,791
Kiddo!

297
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,061
You're a nasty boy.

298
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,061
Die!

299
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,414
Yong. Aem.

300
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:38,814
What are you doing?

301
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:40,054
Let me go!

302
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:46,254
Stop!

303
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:10,454
Kiddo!

304
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:11,734
You're a nasty boy.

305
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:12,734
Die!

306
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:21,534
Kim.

307
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,374
K...Kim.

308
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:50,814
You're here.

309
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:53,374
Lucky brats.

310
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:55,054
Hey, y'all.

311
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:56,494
Now you're all here.

312
00:29:56,974 --> 00:29:58,014
You'll die together.

313
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,374
Help!

314
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:17,854
Sun.

315
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:22,454
Sun!

316
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:26,294
Sun!

317
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:28,214
No!

318
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:30,414
Good.

319
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,574
You're all here.

320
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:34,414
So, I don't have to find you.

321
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:36,134
Rain.

322
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,854
You won't get a second chance this time.

323
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:42,974
But before you die,

324
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:44,574
I have to praise you.

325
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:48,054
You're a thorn in my side.

326
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:50,974
Want to sabotage me?

327
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:52,414
You goddamn punk!

328
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:55,334
You're a monster!

329
00:30:58,534 --> 00:30:59,614
Thank you, Kimhan.

330
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:01,854
I'll take that as a compliment.

331
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:12,494
Wow! Your eyes.

332
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,294
You're scared he'll die?

333
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:16,214
Right?

334
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,174
Such a good time to torture you.

335
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:22,214
I'll kill him first.

336
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:34,134
No!

337
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:36,614
Stop!

338
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,334
Kim!

339
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:52,614
Oops!

340
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:54,054
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,254
I missed my target.

342
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:58,894
But it's okay.

343
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:00,454
I have a lot more bullets.

344
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:26,854
Sun.

345
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,694
I won't let anything happen to you.

346
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:31,294
I promise.

347
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:41,574
Memories of us are so beautiful

348
00:32:43,614 --> 00:32:45,574
even on the last day we met.

349
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:05,814
It's police!

350
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,414
Don't shoot me!

351
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:08,374
No! I surrender!

352
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:11,094
Don't shoot me!

353
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:12,494
Let me go!

354
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:16,494
Kim!

355
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:17,894
Kim!

356
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:19,134
Kim!

357
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:20,974
Kim! Please don't die.

358
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:22,054
Kim!

359
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:26,614
How could you do it?

360
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,334
You're a monster.

361
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:33,814
You lowly servant!

362
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:34,934
Let me go!

363
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:36,094
Do you know who I am?

364
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,214
Let me go!

365
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:38,294
No!

366
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:39,614
Let me go!

367
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:41,054
No!

368
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:42,534
Kim.

369
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:43,214
Kim.

370
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,254
Please don't die.

371
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:44,974
Kim!

372
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:47,414
Kim.

373
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:49,214
Kim.

374
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:49,934
Master Kim.

375
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:54,614
Kim.

376
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:55,734
Do you read?

377
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:59,054
We need an air medical transport for an injured

378
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:00,894
at location 2499. Over.

379
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,774
Kim, please don't die.

380
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:06,254
Kim!

381
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:07,094
Master Kim.

382
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,214
We're transporting an injured patient to Bangkok.

383
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,014
It's gonna be okay, Kim.

384
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:24,654
Kim.

385
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:55,814
Sun.

386
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:58,374
Listen.

387
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:01,014
If one day

388
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,534
this Kim forgets about you,

389
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,534
please tell him

390
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:10,854
how happy he is

391
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:14,694
to find the one he loves

392
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,014
whom he's been searching for.

393
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:22,254
Promise me.

394
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:25,494
What?

395
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:27,774
Well...

396
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:29,814
Promise that you'll tell Kim.

397
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:38,414
I promise.

398
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:40,054
Okay?

399
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:51,894
Kim.

400
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:54,294
I'm sorry.

401
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,774
I couldn't keep that promise.

402
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:04,814
If you can hear me,

403
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,214
I want to say that

404
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,814
that night, at the villa,

405
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:16,294
it's the happiest moment

406
00:37:17,854 --> 00:37:19,454
of us together.

407
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:25,894
Kim.

408
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:28,214
Wake up, Kim!

409
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:33,974
Kim.

410
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:51,134

It's alright.

419
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,214
You're safe now.

420
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:27,774
Kim.

421
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:31,014
Who?

422
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:34,774
Who are you?

423
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,054
Itty...bitty...

424
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:38,734
Bigfoot!

425
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:41,974
Bigfoot!

426
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:43,334
Ouch!

427
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:48,054
It's alright now.

428
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,534
You're safe.

429
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:51,654
It hurts.

430
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:52,174
Oops.

431
00:39:52,494 --> 00:39:53,894
I'm sorry.

432
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:54,774
I'm sorry.

433
00:39:54,774 --> 00:39:55,734
Where does it hurt?

434
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,094
My wound.

435
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:01,934
Hey, brother.

436
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:03,814
Feel better?

437
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:06,454
Rain.

438
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,214
I know everything now.

439
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:12,454
You're such a...

440
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:16,014
Sun.

441
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:19,014
I thank you for keeping promise

442
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,494
to take care this zombie.

443
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:23,734
No problem, Rain.

444
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:26,934
If you're recovered,

445
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:28,734
come help me with my work.

446
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:30,574
I can't do it alone.

447
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:32,894
Hey, Master Rain.

448
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,734
He's just up and about.

449
00:40:37,494 --> 00:40:39,414
You're going to spoil him right away?

450

Rain.

451
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:47,254
Let me...

452
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:50,054
follow my dream.

453
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:52,774
Your dream?

454
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,094
What dream?

no calls.

Not even tell me when to come back.

You meanie.

Great!

470
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:36,687
If we go on like this,

471
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:37,827
we'll be fine.

472
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:38,767

Stop chasing your dream like that.

I won't do it anymore.

I'll chase my dream here.

484

Do you know

491
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:13,867
I'm scared you'll leave me again.

You'll see.

505
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:36,587
I've never known that

waiting for someone I love

507
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,057
is so painful.

508
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:49,667
But when the wait is over,

509
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:52,237
it's so warm

510
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:56,177
like I've never felt before.

511
00:55:04,577 --> 00:55:05,437
From now on,

512
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:08,767
a summer (Kimhan) like me

513
00:55:11,117 --> 00:55:12,727
will have this Sun

514
00:55:15,427 --> 00:55:17,207
to shine bright by my side

or day.

517
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:31,797
I'll be like this

518

forever.
