1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
I'm about to graduate.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,480
Please take care of my brother.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,380
He doesn't have many friends.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,640
I believe that you

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,920
are calm enough

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,380
to be his friend.

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,620
Don't bring anyone to me.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,100
If you bring him to me,

9
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,340
I'll punch him.

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,920
You won't.

11
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,200
Mom.

12
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,080
I miss you.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,700
Baibua,

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,540
wait for me at the canteen.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,400
Here.

16
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,780
What happened

17
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,420
to you?

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,060
Don't come closer.

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Leave me be.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,320
Please.

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,080
Okay.

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,780
I won't.

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,960
I'm...

24
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,660
I'm okay.

25
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm okay.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,140
Last night,

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,900
thank you so much.

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,920
And...

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,340
Sorry.

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,600
Why say it now?

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,500
You should rest.

32
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
I'll be here.

33
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,920
Hey sneaky.

34
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,960
You're up?

35
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,060
Yeah.

36
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Why are you here?

37
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,320
Not practicing?

38
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,860
You must be out cold from the pain killer.

39
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,440
It's already 6 P.M.

40
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,100
What?

41
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,260
I've been out for that long?

42
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,440
Yeah.

43
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,440
Thanks for staying here with me.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
So you didn't practice.

45
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,620
I just got here.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,180
Your young master's here since you blacked out.

47
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,260
He just left when I came a moment ago.

48
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,640
Young master?

49
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,220
Yeah.

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,520
I told him I'll look after you,
but he insisted he'll stay.

51
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,760
Mr. Rain.

52
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,460
You're up?

53
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,440
Feel better?

54
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:56,920
Uh...

55
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,940
I...

56
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,960
Luckily, it's just a bruise.

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,860
Not severe.

58
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,660
Are you okay?

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,740
Want me to drive you home?

60
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm fine.

61
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,020
Are you sure?

62
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Yeah.

63
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,140
See you later.

64
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,100
Okay, see you later.

65
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,180
Bye.

66
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,620
Don't ever do that again.

67
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,660
It's stupid.

68
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,180
Well,

69
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,560
it's my duty.

70
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,700
If it's because of your duty, don't do it again.

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
A nurse said you need water.

72
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,660
Oh.

73
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Mr. Rain.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
I can do it myself.

75
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,060
You always take care of me.

76
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,140
Now it's my turn to

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,140
take care of you.

78
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,060
Are you okay now?

79
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,200
Yeah.

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,560
Let's go then.

81
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,320
I can drive home by myself.

82
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,120
I have to pick up Mr. Kim too.

83
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,220
Let me finish my duty.

84
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,620
As for Kim,

85
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,280
he'll go home on his own.

86
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,220
You're going in that dress?

87
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,220
I took it from your locker.

88
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,240
Don't be surprised.

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,980
1901

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,820
2542

91
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,940
My birthday is the password.

92
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,440
Get changed.

93
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,820
Mr. Rain.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,360
Stay put.

95
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,320
Mr. Rain.

96
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,840
Why you keep calling me?

97
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,600
Oh.

98
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,100
Are you okay, Payoo?

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm fine now.

100
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Thanks, Baibua.

101
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm really worried.

102
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,700
Payoo's okay now.

103
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,820
We're going home.

104
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,320
Go.

105
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,520
Er...

106
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,760
If you need anything, call me.

107
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,820
Go?

108
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
I'll go now, Baibua.

109
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,280
Okay.

110
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
I didn't know

111
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,440
there's a cafe here.

112
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,800
You like it?

113
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,780
I think it's okay.

114
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,240
Hey,

115
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,240
then,

116
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,100
what would you like? I'll order it.

117
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,500
Hm...

118
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,580
Anything's fine.

119
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:39,740
Okay.

120
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,080
Then, I'll order something.

121
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,040
Okay.

122
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,400
Let's sit here.

123
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
Okay.

124
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Oh!

125
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,420
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,140
Let's sit here.

127
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay.

128
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,240
Hey.

129
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,260
Your code-brother told me that

130
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,540
he's coming.

131
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,260
You had to postpone his appointment.

132
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,560
I feel bad.

133
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,740
Instead of going home,

134
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
you're hanging out?

135
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,760
What the hell.

136
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,140
Thank you

137
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,900
for bringing me to this chic cafe.

138
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,800
I study here before you,

139
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,740
but I've never known

140
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,500
about this place.

141
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,480
Normally,

142
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,380
I'd swing by the cafe behind the gym.

143
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
No worries.

144
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,760
By the way,

145
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
what would you like?

146
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,900
I will order...

147
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,320
honey toast. It's my treat.

148
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
I heard it's good.

149
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,220
Sure, just one is enough.

150
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
I can't eat it all.

151
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
Okay, just a moment.

152
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,760
Oh!

153
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,660
I'm

154
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,340
going to toilet.

155
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,860
'kay.

156
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,280
Hey, Kim.

157
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,360
Where you going?

158
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,580
Toilet.

159
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,140
Do I need permission?

160
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:37,740
Hey!

161
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,340
Oh!

162
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,620
I didn't see you.

165
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,560
Enough.

166
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,500
I'll do it myself.

167
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,420
Wait.

168
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,440
Hey.

170
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,820
I said enough.

171
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,720
How couldn't you see?

172
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,540
I'm as big as this room.

173
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,260
Sorry.

174
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,900
I'll go now.

175
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,880
Wait.

176
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,100
You looked awful this afternoon.

177
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm here with Shun.

178
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
Will go home soon.

179
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,720
Who asked?

180
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,460
What the?!

181
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,340
I'm better than you.

182
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,940
Why?

183
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,340
What's better?

184
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,340
You're stalking me here.

185
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,060
What?

186
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,420
This is a public space.

187
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,320
What's wrong with you?

188
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,600
You're really here.

189
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,720
Can't believe my eyes.

190
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,780
How do you guys find me here?

191
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,380
Here.

192
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,900
SU Cute fanpage posted that

193
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,900
they see someone here.

194
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,260
We guess it's you.

195
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
Someone?

196
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,680
Why me?

197
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,040
Really?

198
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,720
See?

199
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,920
Then what?

200
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,660
That SU Cute

201
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
didn't tell you

202
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,860
that I'm not here alone?

203
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,240
Why so frustrating?

204
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,440
Pie!

205
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,460
I'll leave now.

206
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,400
What?

207
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,180
I'm here as you asked.

208
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,360
Right?

209
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,420
Pie!

210
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,620
Wait.

211
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,540
What?

212
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,060
Where you going?

213
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,340
Petch.

214
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,760
Actually,

215
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,160
it's none of your business.

216
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,080
What are you doing?

217
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm here

218
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,860
talking to you.

219
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,780
What more can I say?

220
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,540
Then.

221
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,380
What are you thinking?

222
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,620
Think about what I want to do.

223
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,400
Which is?

224
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,860
Getting away from you.

225
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,480
Okay?

226
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,660
Don't ever follow me around again.

227
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,140
This line

228
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,860
has its own meaning.

229
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,900
You'd better not cross the line.

230
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,160
What happened?

231
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,260
What's wrong with him?

232
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,920
You should go back to your room.

233
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,540
I'm fine now.

234
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,240
Just want to make sure you're okay.

235
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,240
Why?

236
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,360
Feel weird?

237
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,040
You always take care of me.

238
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,240
I just want to return the favor.

239
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,660
Weird?

240
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah.

241
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,900
Here's your pills.

242
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
For bedtime.

243
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,320
Take it now. I'll help.

244
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,840
Mr. Rain.

245
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,440
Get used to it.

246
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,900
It's not that hard to get used to it.

247
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,860
Well... I...

248
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,040
I guess it's my fault

249
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,660
that I've never done this.

250
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,920
I think that

251
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,400
I should do this more often.

252
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,340
Thank you.

253
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,980
You'd feel pain tonight.

254
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
Low pillow will cause more pain.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,120
This should be better.

256
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,420
I'll leave now.

257
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,620
I have morning practice.

258
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,580
Okay.

259
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,240
I think you'd better

260
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,700
take days off your part-time job

261
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,700
until you feel better.

262
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,080
Rain.

263
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
What are you smiling like that?

264
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,260
What?

265
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,280
Well.

266
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,060
What happened?

267
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,540
Nothing.

268
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,180
Who would always look misery like you.

269
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,280
By the way,

270
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,880
Why are you home?

271
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,480
I came to grab some stuffs.

272
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,760
Where's your stuffs?

273
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,600
Er...

274
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,260
Why so nosy?

275
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,960
I'll go now.

276
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,740
What the hell?

277
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,340
You're so cool.

278
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,700
You always follow your heart.

279
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,360
I want to be brave like you.

280
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,600
If you have feelings for someone,

281
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
go for it.

282
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:45,106
What's up? Shun.

283
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:46,666
You're home?

284
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:49,846
Still awake?

285
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:54,946
I'm waiting for someone.

286
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:57,426
He hasn't come back.

287
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,466
He'll be there

288
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:02,186
even when you're not waiting.

289
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,226
That's a lyrics!

290
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:09,846
Should I tell him?

291
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,046
I think...

292
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:12,786
I'll tell him tonight.

293
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:14,646
Wow.

294
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,086
You're so cool.

295
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,266
You always follow your heart.

296
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:20,666
I want to be brave like you.

297
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,266
Keeping your feelings inside is frustrating.

298
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,026
I hate it.

299
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:29,086
If you have feelings for someone,

300
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:30,706
go for it.

301
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:35,746
What if I say it, and nothing goes as planned?

302
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:41,326
Sun,

303
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,566
that's easy.

304
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:45,406
You just accept it.

305
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:47,366
It's not that hard.

306
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,346
At least,

307
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:50,926
I get to say it.

308
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:53,226
It's not okay

309
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,946
to betray my own heart.

310
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:57,706
Us humans

311
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,306
can't betray our feelings. Right?

312
00:28:02,086 --> 00:28:02,346
That's...

313
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:04,386
up to you.

314
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:05,986
Do what you want.

315
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:10,566
Oh!

316
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,006
He's coming.

317
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:14,966
Root for me.

318
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:16,226
Good luck!

319
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,506
Only if it were that easy.

320
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:30,746
Hey.

321
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:31,626
You.

322
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,426
What are you doing?

323
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,006
You talked so loud.

324
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,046
Sleep now.

325
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:39,846
Okay.

326
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,326
Where's the young master?

327
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:45,406
Why he's not here.

328
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:47,426
Never mind.

329
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,046
I'm sleepy as hell.

330
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,606
The couple comets are really returning?

331
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,446
Why does it seem to

332
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,826
get further away?

333
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:34,066
Here's your tea.

334
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:34,846
Thanks.

335
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,066
What are you doing?

336
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:45,606
I'm looking at the villa's documents.

337
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:46,606
Oh.

338
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:47,926
How is it?

339
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,426
Hmm...

340
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,786
It looks good.

341
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,166
Just the location is too remote.

342
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:55,686
Too far from civilization.

343
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:57,246
Umm...

344
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,866
The former owner must have wanted to retire in peacefulness.

345
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,706
If someone lives there alone,

346
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,266
and something happens,

347
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:09,226
I'm scared that

348
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:11,666
it'll take some time

349
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:12,566
or forever

350
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,206
for others to know.

351
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,086
Look.

352
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,026
But I think some customers

353
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,866
love the remoteness like that.

354
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:22,806
Right?

355
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:25,606
It's too quiet.

356
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,586
Too far.

357
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,666
It's like being isolated from the world.

358
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,186
Like being stuck in a prison.

359
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:34,806
That's nice.

360
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,026
In case we're bored,

361
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,886
we can have our own safehouse.

362
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:40,506
Nice?

363
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,586
Vacation house

364
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,126
and safehouse is not the same!

365
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,646
It's different.

366
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:51,006
It's similar:

367
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,426
quiet,

368
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:54,886
alone,

369
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:56,726
No need to see anyone.

370
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:58,866
No one will find us.

371
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,066
They're the same.

372
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:01,406
Or...

373
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,386
Should we make it a safehouse?

374
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:04,546
That's insane.

375
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:06,106
For whom?

376
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,266
Who'd want to buy a safehouse?

377
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:09,506
Well,

378
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,366
just buy it.

379
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:12,486
Maybe,

380
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:15,566
we'll need it one day.

381
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,646
Who knows?

382
00:32:33,106 --> 00:32:33,826
Hey, Shun.

383
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,126
Still awake?

384
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:36,626
Yeah.

385
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,086
Just talked to Sun.

386
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,486
My code-brother?

387
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:41,706
Yeah.

388
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:47,486
Why smiling?

389
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,626
Nothing.

390
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:50,886
Just thinking.

391
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:56,066
By the way,

392
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,046
you're weird tonight.

393
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,166
Rain,

394
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:14,886
I...

395
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:25,406
Shun.

396
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:27,446
What's wrong?

397
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,486
Let's say it's nothing for now.

398
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:39,526
I'll have to make sure.

399
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:41,386
I mean...

400
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,226
with myself.

401
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:54,626
Do I have to do anything to make it easier?

402
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,046
Nothing.

403
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,746
Just be the same old cool you

404
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:01,766
like this is enough.

405
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:11,086
Really?

406
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:13,706
Yeah.

407
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:16,986
Okay.

408
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:20,626
Let's sleep.

409
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,706
It's hot.

410
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,026
Aren't you hot?

411
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:15,446
Seems like AC isn't working.

412
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,066
Aren't you hot?

413
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:43,886
Yeah.

414
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:51,726
If you're hot,

415
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:53,786
why sleep in wet shirt?

416
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:58,486
What can I do?

417
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:02,866
Take it off.

418
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,426
I'll help.

419
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:07,726
It's okay!

420
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,086
Let me.

421
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:12,366
I want to.

422
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,666
Feel better?

423
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,366
Yeah.

424
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:11,186
Wait.

425
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,826
Hate it?

426
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:21,826
Is it okay?

427
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:24,046
Yeah.

428
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:03,666
Are you okay?

429
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:07,586
Shun!

430
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:14,106
Are you okay?

431
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,366
What did you

432
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:17,566
just say?

433
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,486
Are you hot?

434
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,046
Seems like AC isn't working.

435
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:27,726
Oh.

436
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,406
I'll call the mechanic tomorrow.

437
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:35,746
Okay.

438
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:37,086
Let's sleep.

439
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,646
Since childhood,

440
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,806
your brother has always made me proud.

441
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,386
Have you noticed that I don't care much about you?

442
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:02,846
Do you want to know why?

443
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:15,870
You...

444
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,310
What happened?

445
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,970
Don't come closer.

446
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,930
Leave me be.

447
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,230
Please.

448
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,210
You should rest.

449
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,090
I'll be here.

450
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,210
Why you keep thinking about him?!

451
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,500
I want to talk to you.

452
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,760
If you're so coward,

453
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,050
it's fine.

454
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,920
Stay down there.

455
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,350
But I know you hear me.

456
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,090
Since childhood,

457
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,030
your brother has always made me proud.

458
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,450
But you...

459
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,110
Have you noticed that
I don't care much about you?

460
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,450
Do you want to know why?

461
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,380
I don't understand you.

462
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,580
I don't get you.

463
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,020
Since you're young until now.

464
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,330
I'll never understand you.

465
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,610
Never...

466
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,170
Until I die.

467
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,410
But as your father.

468
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,070
I have a lesson for you.

469
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,110
Whether you listen

470
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,740
or not is up to you.

471
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,530
But I want you to know that

472
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,380
duty

473
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,370
comes before freedom.

474
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,710
Everyone's born with duty.

475
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,290
Rain has his.

476
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,910
Payoo has his.

477
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,580
You also have yours.

478
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,440
But whether you care about it

479
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,900
is up to you.

480
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,780
But you

481
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,610
talked to Rain.

482
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,340
You should do as Rain said.

483
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,490
Fulfill your duty.

484
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,130
Finish your job.

485
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,310
Everything is your duty.

486
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,020
Follow the order is duty?

487
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,030
You're here!

488
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,740
- I miss you.
- Hi, mom.

489
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,770
We're here early this year.

490
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,460
Only Kim is here this time.

491
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,620
Rain is with his dad at workplace.

492
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,210
He wants Rain to be like him.

493
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,780
I'm glad you came.

494
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,850
Oh, my Kim.

495
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,550
You got so much taller,

496
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,430
and more handsome.

497
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,860
Let's get inside for some snacks.

498
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,700
I've prepared a lot for you.

499
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,370
And there is

500
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,100
a present for you!

501
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,200
What?!

502
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,940
Here, Jumbo!

503
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,070
So cute!

504
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,100
He seems to be fun now.

505
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,820
He missed his brother all the way here.

506
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,460
I guess he won't for a while.

507
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,850
He'll forget about Rain for sure.

508
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,740
Stay longer

509
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,090
this time.

510
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,660
Come get him when school starts.

511
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,590
Okay?

512
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,170
Jumbo!

513
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,020
Jumbo!

514
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,190
Jumbo!

515
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,430
Who's there?!

516
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,560
Who's there?

517
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,000
Speak up! Or you'll be a bad guy.

518
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,320
I'll shoot you!

519
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,600
Bang! Bang! Bang!

520
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,540
I'm shot!

521
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,220
Help!

522
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,770
Wow.

523
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,890
Drama.

524
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,670
Why grandma has to bring this dish to that place?

525
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,370
The bad guy must be there.

526
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,110
Are you okay?

527
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,070
How dare you.

528
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,070
You can't escape me now.

529
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,500
Don't come closer.

530
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,590
No!

531
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,390
Don't!

532
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,890
Fork must be spoon.

533
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,850
We should not go against the rules of the world.

534
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,940
I told you

535
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,130
to do everything

536
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,370
as your heart wants.

537
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,400
Do you still

538
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,830
want to join our club?

539
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,620
Wait!

540
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,530
Hey.

541
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,120
Can I ask you something?

542
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,010
What did you thank me for?

543
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,450
Well,

544
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,910
for bringing me home last night.

545
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,770
And...

546
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,290
Why say sorry?

547
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:37,860
Ah...

548
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,980
I made a mess.

549
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,750
That you puked on me?

550
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:47,870
Hey!

551
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:49,750
You.

552
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,640
You remember it all?

553
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,750
Who wouldn't?

554
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:00,930
Never mind it.

555
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,660
You can talk back like this.

556
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,990
That means you're fine now.

557
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,960
I'll leave then.

558
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,620
You should go home.
