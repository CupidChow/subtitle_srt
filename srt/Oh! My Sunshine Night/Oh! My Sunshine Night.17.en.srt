1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,250
Can you tell me

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,740
what's up there?

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,770
I think...

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,490
It's a promise.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,300
If you want me to notice you, you have to be brave.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,260
You want me to be hurt.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,260
Now I am.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,690
I now know where Kimhan is.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,780
Great.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,300
You wait there.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,170
Sure, boss.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,410
Book a private jet for me, STAT.

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,560
Where to?

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,480
Chiang Rai.

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Ouch!

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,690
Hey!

17
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,370
Kim!

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:55,790
Kim!

19
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,150
What's wrong?

20
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,730
I'm fine.

21
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,450
You...

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,070
Just a headache.

23
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,290
Are you sure?

24
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,020
It's like stabbing head pain

25
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,960
when I recall too many memories.

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,670
Take it slow.

27
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,010
The more you try,

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,500
the more you hurt.

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,260
Why'd you...

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,960
worry about me so much?

31
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,720
Because I care.

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,010
I can't help but worry.

33
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,880
In the past...

34
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,300
If I ever did you wrong

35
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,500
or hurt you,

36
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,940
I want to say that

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,220
I didn't mean it.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,530
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,940
I know.

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,440
I'll tell you one thing.

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,700
You've never made me sad.

42
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,570
Not even once.

43
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,040
So, don't apologize.

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,240
All this time,

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,340
memories of us

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,040
are so beautiful

47
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,520
even on the last day we met.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,210
I...

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
want to say that...

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,000
it was my happiest day.

51
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,780
Today...

52
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,060
is the day that couple comets

53
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
will return to each other after 70 years.

54
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,800
It's believed that

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,680
we can make a wish upon these comets.

56
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,070
It represents the wait for the couple comets

57
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,410
that return to each other every 70 years.

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,060
It's believed that

59
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,980
we can make a wish upon those comets.

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,820
Couple comets.

61
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,610
You're booked.

62
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,770
Let's watch it together.

63
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,120
Sure.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,170
I have two telescopes anyway.

65
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,690
Promise?

66
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,990
Yeah.

67
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,230
I have so many wishes to ask.

68
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,700
Only one can be granted.

69
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,000
You need to pick one.

70
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,320
Can I have two?

71
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,010
Just one.

72
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,380
What time is it?

73
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:41,870
Um...

74
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,710
I think...

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,320
Almost 9 P.M.

76
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,860
We need to be hurry.

77
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,240
Do you...

78
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,290
need any help?

79
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,430
It's okay.

80
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,260
Will it be punctual?

81
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,180
It's been calculated.

82
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,320
You look excited.

83
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,320
We may only see them once in our lives.

84
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,290
So they're called couple comets.

85
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,390
Once

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,410
in a lifetime

87
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,950
with the one.

88
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:10,960
Hey.

89
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:11,550
What?

90
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,740
What will you wish for?

91
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,860
Why do you want to know?

92
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,800
So I won't wish for the same one.

93
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,450
How about you?

94
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,720
What's the wish?

95
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,560
If I say it, it's not a wish.

96
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,330
Right?

97
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,580
Uh...

98
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,700
Fine.

99
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,220
Baibua.

100
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,630
If you close you eyes,

101
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,390
you wouldn't know

102
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,360
that they're here.

103
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,120
I don't need eyes to see.

104
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,810
I just use my heart.

105
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:33,940
So...

106
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,100
I know it with my heart.

107
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,310
Okay?

108
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,780
I see.

109
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,020
What are you wishing for?

110
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,260
Secret!

111
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,020
Awww.

112
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,760
Tell me.

113
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,250
Please.

114
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,050
Go away!

115
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,650
I'm losing focus.

116
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,690
Hey!

117
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,770
It's 9 P.M.

118
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,250
They're here.

119
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Wow.

120
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,810
They're here.

121
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,410
Actually,

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,700
I wanted to make a wish to fulfill my lifelong dream.

123
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,320
But I changed my mind.

124
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:00,485
Oh.

125
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:02,295
Thank you.

126
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,155
No problem.

127
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:08,375
Why are you here alone?

128
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:10,565
Where's Petch and Pie?

129
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:12,915
No clue.

130
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,055
They're always like this.

131
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,125
How?

132
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:19,475
Well...

133
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,955
Everybody says they don't get along.

134
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:25,795
Yeah.

135
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,245
It seems that way.

136
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:31,655
But actually...

137
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:35,535
They always care about each other a lot.

138
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,145
Just too stubborn to admit.

139
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:42,525
That's great.

140
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:44,005
At least...

141
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,155
Pie knows Petch worries about him.

142
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:48,565
And Petch...

143
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,775
has someone he likes.

144
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:52,515
Someone he cares for.

145
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:56,405
Why?

146
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:00,015
You sound like you have no one to care for.

147
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:09,675
I have.

148
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:13,485
But it's just me

149
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,325
who cares about that person.

150
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,155
Just that.

151
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:25,055
Wait...

152
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,575
Don't tell me you also made a wish?

153
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:30,995
Yeah.

154
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:32,195
How about you?

155
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:33,715
No way.

156
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:35,875
I have no one.

157
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,165
I just go along with everyone.

158
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:42,595
That's it.

159
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,625
It's weird.

160
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,955
I don't quite understand you guys.

161
00:15:58,365 --> 00:15:58,755
Yeah.

162
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:01,715
Ouch!

163
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:02,875
Hey!

164
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:06,725
Don't. It'll get infected.

165
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,085
How is it?

166
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:29,205
It's okay.

167
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,355
Are you really an athlete?
Your hands are so soft.

168
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:42,215
Okay?

169
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:46,535
Yeah.

170
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:55,825
It feels nice.

171
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,045
What?

172
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:01,635
Well...

173
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:04,925
To have someone care for me.

174
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:08,625
It just feels like this.

175
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:10,885
Oh.

176
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,035
Really?

177
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:18,305
Thank you, Oh.

178
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:20,895
Yeah.

179
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,065
Then...

180
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,225
I'll patch myself up.

181
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:25,915
And...

182
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:27,325
I...

183
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,745
I'll return it later.

184
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,115
Just keep it.

185
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:35,935
Okay.

186
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:38,685
I'll handle this.

187
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:48,235
Why do I feel this way?

188
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:53,855
Must be because of wine.

189
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,735
Can I come in?

190
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:14,935
Sure.

191
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:29,425
Did you

192
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,155
really make a wish?

193
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:37,485
Why?

194
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,735
I'm just not sure

195
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,565
that you'd believe it.

196
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:52,235
Actually,

197
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:58,755
I wanted to make a wish to fulfill my lifelong dream.

198
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:03,795
But I changed my mind.

199
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:09,245
Why?

200
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,675
Because I gave you my wish.

201
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,755
I wished that what you wished and dreamed for

202
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:29,975
will be granted.

203
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,695
You gave away your one wish

204
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:37,315
to others?

205
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,895
What I wanted is quite ridiculous

206
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,695
compared to yours.

207
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:55,825
Do you know

208
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:57,675
what I wished for?

209
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,435
I'm sure it must be very important.

210
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,685
I wished for my brother's safety.

211
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:26,655
Then...

212
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,345
Rain will absolutely be safe.

213
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:35,085
Because...

214
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:38,045
Your wish combined with mine

215
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,415
will double its power.

216
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:46,015
Thank you.

217
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:50,795
It'll take another 70 years

218
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:52,835
until they come back.

219
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:56,245
Yeah.

220
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,155
It's okay.

221
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,055
Just repay me next time

222
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:09,875
and make a wish with me.

223
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,005
In next 70 years?

224
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:16,625
Yeah.

225
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,155
Promise me.

226
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:22,645
Uh huh.

227
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:25,605
Say it.

228
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:28,655
Okay.

229
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:29,855
I promise.

230
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:09,885
Are you okay?

231
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,735
It might sounds rude.

232
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:21,295
But I want everyone

233
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:24,055
to leave this place ASAP.

234
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,285
Better yet, tomorrow.

235
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:34,875
Why?

236
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:56,215
This is how you repay my wish?

237
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:43,515
Finally,

238
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:45,685
we met.

239
00:27:22,535 --> 00:27:22,835
Kim.

240
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:25,975
Rain!

241
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,045
Rain.

242
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:42,755
It's really you.

243
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,555
I thought I'll never see you again.

244
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:52,715
Me too.

245
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,805
I didn't think I'd survive.

246
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,905
The only thought

247
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,735
was I had to survive.

248
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:09,155
Rain.

249
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:12,175
Rain.

250
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:15,035
How are you?

251
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:20,675
Your leg...

252
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:24,645
It's a small price

253
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,625
I had to pay for my survival.

254
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:31,175
Rain...

255
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:41,705
Our parents...

256
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:55,765
I know.

257
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:05,565
Say no more.

258
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:12,835
You have to be strong.

259
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:32,975
What happened

260
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,225
to all of us?

261
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:47,155
Sir!

262
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,255
What's wrong?

263
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,835
Propellers aren't working.
I'm currently using APU.

264
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,205
How about auto pilot?

265
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:54,565
Wait for my orders.

266
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:56,845
Do something!

267
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:58,125
I can't.

268
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,415
We need to go up!

269
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:19,945
One thing I knew

270
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:23,045
was that I flew out of the window

271
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:25,255
50 metres before the crash.

272
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,845
Luckily, I landed on a branch before falling.

273
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:39,865
Kim.

274
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:43,135
It's not an accident.

275
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,355
It's a murder attempt.

276
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:56,975
One thing I knew

277
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:01,405
was that I had to survive.

278
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,925
I went along the waterfall

279
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:10,535
to get out of the woods.

280
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:12,805
And come back here.

281
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,055
Even it's the most dangerous place,

282
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:19,535
I believe that

283
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,675
it's the safest as well.

284
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:25,975
I did my best to hide,

285
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,195
let no one know,

286
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:31,445
and tried to recover.

287
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:33,965
To wait for the day.

288
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:42,035
I'll kill them!

289
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,065
I'll kill them all!

290
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,435
Kim, stop!

291
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,095
Trust me.

292
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:49,605
No!

293
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,355
Let me go!

294
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:51,895
Kim.

295
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,465
They killed our parents.

296
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:57,245
They killed our parents!

297
00:31:59,535 --> 00:32:00,615
Kim, stop!

298
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:07,695
You're not recovered?

299
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:11,955
I'll kill them.

300
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:19,885
Calm down.

301
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,405
You've been here for so long.

302
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:40,835
Why?

303
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:43,245
Why didn't you tell me.

304
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,075
Because you're like this.

305
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:50,265
Reckless.

306
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:51,935
So I had to hide,

307
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,745
plan everything,

308
00:32:55,895 --> 00:32:56,895
prepare everything,

309
00:32:57,965 --> 00:32:59,545
and be very cautious

310
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:03,855
to take them down.

311
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:05,855
What's more.

312
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:08,315
If I go out,

313
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,575
they'll track you down more easily.

314
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,195
You'll be in danger.

315
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:19,765
Just like you.

316
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:22,955
You're trying to protect the ones you love.

317
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:28,445
You know?

318
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:33,805
You do everything

319
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,895
to make sure everyone's safe.

320
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:44,895
I'll make them pay.

321
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:49,115
I'll make them pay for what they did to us.

322
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:03,475
How?

323
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:07,475
Master Rain

324
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,275
tried to tell me through Snow White.

325
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:56,285
Iquazu.

326
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:04,295
It led me here

327
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:07,015
to Master Rain.

328
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,075
Master Rain!

329
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:54,435
Payoo...

330
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:15,355
What happened, Master Rain?

331
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,455
I'm so happy to find you.

332
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:00,485
Payoo's taken care of me this past 3 months.

333
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:03,535
Without him,

334
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,235
I'd be dead.

335
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,125
I'm sorry, Master Kim.

336
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:15,145
I didn't tell you about this.

337
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:19,965
I ordered him.

338
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:22,875
For our safety.

339
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:26,685
Just wait a bit more.

340
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:28,445
They're taking the bait.

341
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:32,455
They'll pay for what they did.

342
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,325
Keep this.

343
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,325
Your shoes?

344
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:39,815
If someone bullies you again,

345
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:41,535
show these shoes to them

346
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:43,955
and say that you have a friend this big.

347
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:46,415
Of course.

348
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:49,845
With feet this big, body must be big too.

349
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,385
No one will dare bully me. Thank you.

350
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:55,595
Come at me, you big losers!

351
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,215
Do you know my friend?!

352
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,195
The Bigfoot!

353
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:08,755
Itty bitty!

354
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:13,475
Bigfoot.

355
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:19,945
It's really you.

356
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:27,375
I can't believe

357
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,635
I finally found you.

358
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:53,295
It's all thank to that Youtube video from 3 years ago

359
00:41:54,465 --> 00:41:56,695
that you talked about red sneakers.

360
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:01,055
That means...

361
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,585
You transferred here in your 3rd year

362
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:05,795
because of that?

363
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:09,815
Yeah.

364
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,415
It might sound

365
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:14,225
irrational.

366
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,015
But the childhood memory that can surpass everything

367
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:21,355
is hard to find.

368
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:23,035
One in a million.

369
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,145
Right?

370
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:28,455
How about guitar?

371
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:30,055
You love it?

372
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:37,585
It's the only thing that connects me with you.

373
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,045
You...

374
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:43,195
play it without loving it.

375
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:45,665
Is that possible?

376
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:49,635
No.

377
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,675
I have to thank you

378
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:54,885
for making me learn to play it.

379
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:57,595
I have it as my friend

380
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:00,405
in joy and in sorrow.

381
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,745
I love it.

382
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:05,675
Great.

383
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:10,245
I appreciate what you did for me.

384
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:12,675
But I...

385
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:15,655
I've never done anything for you.

386
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:18,035
Thank you.

387
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:20,095
What I did...

388
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:22,735
includes your scar on your arm?

389
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:36,625
This?

390
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:45,915
Someone

391
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:48,975
is destined to just wait.

392
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,415
But someone

393
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:55,785
is destined to search the world.

394
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,415
And that is...

395
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:27,265
Who are you?

396
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:29,595
How did you get in my room?

397
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:30,615
Kim...

398
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:32,755
Get out of my room!

399
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:37,145
Sun!

400
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:38,555
What happened?!

401
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,955
He stormed in in the morning,

402
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:42,375
and said he'll go home.

403
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:47,675
It's that kid!

404
00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:49,755
He'll be useful for us.

405
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:29,815
Today...

406
00:47:30,635 --> 00:47:32,075
is the day that couple comets

407
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:34,855
will return to each other after 70 years.

408
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:37,735
It's believed that

409
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,715
we can make a wish upon these comets.

410
00:48:10,295 --> 00:48:11,215
There they come!

411
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:12,665
They're here!
