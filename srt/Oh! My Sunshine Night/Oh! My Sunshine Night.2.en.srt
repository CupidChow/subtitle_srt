1
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,740
That's perfect! Kim.

2
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,660
That's our club's ace!

3
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,020
Number 10.

4
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,360
My brother.

5
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,680
Interview him.

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,140
And you'll forget about me.

7
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,140
Even though I just transferred here,

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,720
I want to be a part of this band

9
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,840
to do what I love.

10
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,360
Well...

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,380
Ain't it funny?

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,620
Do whatever you like.

13
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,180
No one cares that much.

14
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,160
Such a cold-hearted person.

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,740
Or even lifeless.

16
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,840
You're back.

17
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,120
Hello, dad.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,220
How are our young masters today?

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,020
Did you meet them?

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,340
They are fine.

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,100
I picked up master Rain after school.

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,200
Uh..

23
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,860
Both young masters.

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,180
So, everything's okay.

25
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes.

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,100
You must always look after them.

27
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,920
Don't forget we owe their parents our lives.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,140
Sure.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,380
- I have to go now
- Oh.

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,940
A part-time job again?

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,440
Yes.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
I have night shift today.

33
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,220
See you in the morning.

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
[Birthday wish message]

35
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,200
[Birthday wish message from AIS, phone service provider]

36
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,300
Does any real person

37
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,100
Know it's my birthday?

38
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,080
Baby boy! Baby boy!

39
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,320
My baby boy.

40
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,780
How do you feel?

41
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,420
Eat this apple.

42
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,940
So you'll feel better.

43
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,220
Okay, mom.

44
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,540
You completed all course credits, right?

45
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,260
So, why must you go to the university?

46
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm practicing rugby.

47
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,220
And train newcomers.

48
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,940
You should spend your time.

49
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,800
On training yourself for our business.

50
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,820
He's always been doing it.

51
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,420
And will always be.

52
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
Give me a little more time.

53
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,080
Okay.

54
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,740
Then...

55
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,460
You must stop after this match.

56
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,760
Okay.

57
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
Rain.

58
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,880
I saw alumni come to university all the time.

59
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,340
This Friday evening too.

60
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,040
Especially in sports season.

61
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
You should also come.

62
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,420
Kim!

63
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,080
Butler Santi.

64
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,100
I'd like hot tea.

65
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,020
Yes, madam.

66
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:30,920
Hey.

67
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,600
How about you?

68
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,060
When...

69
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,740
Will you stop with music and pursue our business?

70
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,660
What's wrong with music?

71
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,940
Kim!

72
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,140
I think...

73
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,800
You should shut up as your brother suggested.

74
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
I just want to explain.

75
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,960
And correct your thought.

76
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,160
Butler Santi.

77
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,440
I'd like some whiskey.

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,060
Yes, madam.

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,060
You got your eyes from me.

80
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,400
And nothing else.

81
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,560
I'll consider myself lucky.

82
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,060
Kimhan!

83
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,320
Butler Santi.

84
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,800
I'd like more whiskey.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,180
Yes, madam.

86
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,280
I think...

87
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,560
He got your heart too.

88
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,360
That's why he's so brave.

89
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,040
You always spoil him.

90
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,380
All of you!

91
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,180
That's why he's so weak!

92
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,260
Let me tell you this...

93
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,200
Music won't get your far.

94
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,760
It's my business

95
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,880
That will take you anywhere you want.

96
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,020
I won't go anywhere.

97
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
I'll grow my root where I was planted.

98
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,020
Don't worry.

99
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm doing fine.

100
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,320
This meal was delicious.

101
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,460
Thank you.

102
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,820
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
If you were a tree,

104
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,340
Be a pine tree.

105
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Bending in the wind

106
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,640
But never breaking.

107
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,640
You can't even be...

108
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,620
A damn good tree!

109
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,140
Kim.

110
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,920
Kim!

111
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,100
I'll take care...

112
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,340
Of our business.

113
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,860
I'll do my best.

114
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,580
Please advise me.

115
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,780
Kim.

116
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,860
Kim!

117
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
Kim, I'm sorry.

118
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,320
It's not your fault.

119
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,660
I can't stop your dad from controlling you.

120
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Forgive me.

121
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,420
I've never blamed you.

122
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,200
Or anyone.

123
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,380
Actually,

124
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,720
I don't even care.

125
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,380
Don't worry.

126
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm fine.

127
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,320
Are you really fine?

128
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,360
What you did.

129
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,700
Was spoiling him.

130
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,560
Isn't it my duty?

131
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,080
Change your brother

132
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,940
to be like you.

133
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,520
Is your duty.

134
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,020
You can't always hide in the water.

135
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,940
Dad told me to change you.

136
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
You always want to be me, right?

137
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:30,092
Back to your comfort zone again?

138
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,772
You'd better face the truth.

139
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,152
You always do that

140
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,172
When things go wrong.

141
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,352
You can't always hide in the water.

142
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,412
Dad told me to change you.

143
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,652
You always want to be me, right?

144
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:11,252
I can't be you.

145
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:12,672
Why?

146
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:16,532
I'm way cooler than you.

147
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,352
- You stupid.
- Rain!

148
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:22,172
I'm serious here.

149
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:28,992
If I'm not here,

150
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:31,352
You'll have to laugh like this.

151
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,332
Where you going?

152
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,032
I have a match next week.

153
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:38,672
So, I have to be in a camp.

154
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:40,472
How long?

155
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,412
Until the match ends.

156
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:43,952
So, about a week.

157
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,952
You can invite your friends over.

158
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:55,712
Set up a tent in the backyard sounds fun.

159
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:02,932
I've only few friends.

160
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,932
You're about to be a fourth-year.

161
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,032
But you already completed all course credits.

162
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:14,072
You also completed internship.

163
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,572
How can you find new friends now?

164
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,352
To live in this world...

165
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,212
You need social life.

166
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:28,812
Just go.

167
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:30,852
Don't worry.

168
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,732
I'm fine being alone.

169
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,652
Be a pine tree bending in the wind.

170
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:42,832
Don't resist.

171
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:44,172
Get it?

172
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:45,792
I'm not a pine tree.

173
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:50,052
I know you're a free-form big tree.

174
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,932
But can you be a pine tree next week?

175
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:54,692
Do it for me, okay?

176
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:01,412
I beg you.

177
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,292
Okay.

178
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:09,892
Good.

179
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,332
And come to watch my match that day.

180
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:17,932
Sure.

181
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:20,452
Gotta go.

182
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:23,292
Where to?

183
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:27,672
Nowhere.

184
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,072
Nowhere?

185
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,232
What the heck?

186
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:44,672
It's hot.

187
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:52,852
Enjoy your meal.

188
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,252
Payoo!

189
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:55,992
Oh!

190
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:57,112
Baibua.

191
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,172
I've never known

192
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,472
You're working here.

193
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:02,472
Yeah, it's just a part-time job.

194
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:05,512
Such a hard worker.

195
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,172
Payoo!

196
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,472
- Yes?
- Refill charcoal for table 5.

197
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,012
Okay!

198
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:15,552
Gotta go.

199
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,432
If you want anything, just tell me.

200
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:19,172
Thanks.

201
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:24,192
Tough night.

202
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:25,972
That's good.

203
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,752
Better crowded than empty.

204
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:28,732
That's right.

205
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,132
Now, get some charcoals.

206
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:32,972
Okay.

207
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:58,552
Hi, Sun. You've never missed a day.

208
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:00,732
Hi uncle.

209
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,252
- See you later.
- Good luck.

210
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,312
Phew. That was close.

211
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:21,032
Your feet are so big.

212
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,092
Piss off!

213
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:26,572
Ouch!

214
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,672
Such a meanie.

215
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,432
Think you're so cool?

216
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,192
Light...

217
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,012
will sustain life, right?

218
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,552
I know you don't want to die.

219
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,132
I'll take good care of you guys

220
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:11,952
as best as I can.

221
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:29,832
I still have some time.

222
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:30,952
I'll practice.

223
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:32,392
Ouch!

224
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:21,237
Crap. I never learn, did I?

225
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:27,837
You can do it, Sun!

226
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:39,857
- Er...
- I gotta go.

227
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,057
You're driving to university?

228
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:43,337
Yeah.

229
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,657
I haven't used the car in a while.

230
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:46,937
Not good for tires.

231
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:49,597
I also have a meeting with friends.

232
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,597
So, Rain won't have to wait for me.

233
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:54,017
Er... But...

234
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,637
Master would get mad at me.

235
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,237
Let me drive you there.

236
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,637
And master Rain is coming.

237
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,897
It's fine, Payoo.

238
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,377
I'll go now. Tell Rain I'm going alone.

239
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:05,597
Er...

240
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:07,357
Okay.

241
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:12,697
Really? Kim?

242
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:15,017
Well...

243
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,337
I tried to stop him.

244
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,197
It's okay.

245
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:19,877
Leave him be.

246
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:25,737
I envy him.

247
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:29,377
He can do anything he wants on his own.

248
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,137
Yeah.

249
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,037
Hello, aunt Sookwan.

250
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:41,957
Hello.

251
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,417
Visiting my dad?

252
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:44,337
Yeah.

253
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:46,417
Are you going to university?

254
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:47,397
Yes.

255
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:51,977
We'll finally get to work together after you're graduating soon.

256
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,117
Yeah.

257
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:55,097
I'll be needing your advice.

258
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:56,357
Sure.

259
00:24:57,957 --> 00:24:59,037
I'll excuse myself.

260
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,777
Can bird's nest really help with your fatigue?

261
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,497
I think so.
I've been drinking it since young.

262
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:29,777
Ever seen me sick?

263
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,477
I think its sugar is too high.

264
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,697
So, I'm not sure if you recover your fatigue

265
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,197
Because of sugar or the bird's nest.

266
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,797
It's just a drink. Don't over think it.

267
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:01,817
By the way...

268
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,237
Did I steal your bed?

269
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:07,217
Not at all.

270
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:10,377
It's your house.

271
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:12,417
You can sleep anywhere.

272
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:13,617
And...

273
00:26:13,997 --> 00:26:15,697
You always sleep in my bed

274
00:26:15,997 --> 00:26:18,037
Every night I do part-time job anyway.

275
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,857
I'm used to it.

276
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:22,857
Right.

277
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:24,477
I just loiter around.

278
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,417
And get sleepy.

279
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:32,217
Whatever you like. I'm all fine.

280
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,997
I'll bring your backpack to your club room.

281
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:40,257
Don't.

282
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:43,237
If you do that,

283
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:46,697
I'll be embarrassed.

284
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,337
But it's my duty.

285
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:54,257
Your duty

286
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,277
Is to make me a clown?

287
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:01,977
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

288
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:07,477
Both you and master Kim

289
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:11,957
Won't let me help you do these stuffs.

290
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:15,277
Actually, I want to do it all.

291
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:18,397
Hey.

292
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:22,617
If I'm still your master Rain or young master,

293
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:25,257
Then do as I told you.

294
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,257
I, Kim, and you.

295
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:32,357
We grew up together.

296
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:34,657
We're all friends.

297
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,957
Not masters and a servant.

298
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,057
Live for yourself.

299
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,157
For your own happiness.

300
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,017
I'm not asking you.

301
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,557
It's an order.

302
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:03,697
I have a class.

303
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:05,197
Got to go now.

304
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:14,417
Payoo.

305
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:16,017
Yes?

306
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:18,197
Come to watch me

307
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,337
On the match day if you're free.

308
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,617
In case I get injured,

309
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:28,017
You can save me.

310
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,157
I can't rely on Kim.

311
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:33,457
You know him well.

312
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:35,497
He's inconsiderate.

313
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:37,237
He won't even come.

314
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:39,817
Well...

315
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:40,937
But...

316
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:42,917
I'm not asking.

317
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:44,177
It's an order.

318
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,197
I still have some time.

319
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:25,057
I'll practice.

320
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:06,817
Ouch!

321
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,057
I'm fine.

322
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,837
It's not that hurt.

323
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,617
Professor.

324
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:33,917
Come to see me?

325
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:36,377
I want a chance to join the band.

326
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:37,797
Opportunity and ability

327
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:39,337
Always come together.

328
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:42,317
Not everyone gets that opportunity.

329
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
Planting means like.

330
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,920
Composting means love.

331
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,300
Add more compost,

332
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,940
So, love can make it green again.

333
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,040
What if it blossoms?

334
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,580
It means what?

335
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,040
It's happy.

336
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,600
Wanna try?

337
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,080
So you...

338
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,100
Can be happier.

339
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,020
I understand

340
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
How it feels

341
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,880
To lose

342
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,520
What you used to have.

343
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Wake up!

344
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,240
I'll move it to the ground.

345
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,320
And...

346
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,440
See you at the music club.

347
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't be late.

348
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,440
You're always so late that prof's mad.

349
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,300
Okay.

350
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,680
See you.

351
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,720
So unemotional.

352
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,160
Thanks.

353
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,500
Professor.

354
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,220
Come to see me?

355
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,120
Yes.

356
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,040
What's wrong?

357
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,740
Well...

358
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,000
I want to...

359
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,180
[Audition Postpone Notice]

360
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,600
It's been postponed.

361
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,820
There's a big audition coming.

362
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,180
I know.

363
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,820
Then I'll leave now.

364
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,140
I want a chance to join the band.

365
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,220
It's very important to me.

366
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,180
I transferred from another university to study here.

367
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,540
Because I want to join this band.

368
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,260
If I don't get this chance,

369
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,560
Everything I've ever wished for

370
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,600
Would be...

371
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,880
Opportunity and ability

372
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,660
Always come together.

373
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,320
Not everyone gets that opportunity.

374
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,680
And your ability...

375
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,060
I'm not sure if

376
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,600
You'll get selected.

377
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
Because I haven't seen it.

378
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
But I want to...

379
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,260
Bye.

380
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,240
Out of water.

381
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,860
I guess he's not leaving soon.

382
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,280
I'll go to the club.

383
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,020
I'll be back later.

384
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,940
It may not seem appropriate

385
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,860
But if you want to observe our club.

386
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,900
I'll allow you specially.

387
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Thank you so much!

388
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,700
Thank you.

389
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,100
Hey. What are you waiting for?

390
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,420
I might change my mind.

391
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,120
Okay!

392
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,900
Thanks.

393
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,380
You know his schedule that well?

394
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,660
We can do anything

395
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,660
For the one we love.

396
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,300
Not just knowing schedule.

397
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,840
You've been following him for a year.

398
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,980
Still no progress.

399
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,100
It is.

400
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,100
At least...

401
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,960
You recognized.

402
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,480
What I am doing over this whole year.

403
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,780
I'm in a hurry.

404
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,360
Just a minute won't waste so much of your time.

405
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,120
My time is not yours.

406
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,300
It's not the same.

407
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,880
Kimhan.

408
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,420
Well...

409
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,940
I have fencing match today.
Please go watch it.

410
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm busy.

411
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,860
I want you to watch it
because our club needs more members.

412
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
In case... You'll change your mind
when you watch it.

413
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,400
I won't.

414
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,720
Thanks.

415
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,100
Hey!

416
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,280
Kim.

417
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,580
Better late than never.

418
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,000
Welcome.

419
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,540
What the hell?

420
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,060
Where's your sheet music?
Wanna use mine?

421
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,540
Okay.

422
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:33,960
Well.

423
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,600
Are you ready?

424
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,900
1...2...

425
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,620
Um...

426
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,460
You can sit here as long as you want.

427
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,960
Thank you so much.

428
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,760
It's you.

429
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,680
Oh no.

430
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,720
I'm doomed.

431
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,540
Our club will have to perform

432
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
For the rugby match closing ceremony.

433
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,120
I'll be in your life.

434
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,140
You'll never forget about me.

435
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,300
What's the rush?

436
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,540
That's enough for today.

437
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,520
Dismiss.

438
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,440
What?

439
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,380
Kim?

440
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
Last night...

441
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,860
What happened?

442
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,680
Last night...

443
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
We...

444
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,120
Kissed...

445
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,400
It's hot.

446
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,860
Is this okay?

447
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,400
You're already here.

448
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,500
You have a crush on him since first year.

449
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,640
You took too long to build up courage.

450
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,540
But...

451
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,440
Don't spill the beans.

452
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,140
That I'm here for him.

453
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,180
Okay. Just go.

454
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,260
Okay.

455
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,680
Oh.

456
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,200
It's you.

457
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,560
I guess he's not leaving soon.

458
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,940
I'll go to the club.

459
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,600
I'll be back later.

460
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,680
It may not seem appropriate

461
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,720
But if you want to observe our club.

462
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,780
I'll allow you specially.

463
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,880
Thank you so much!

464
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,520
Thank you.
