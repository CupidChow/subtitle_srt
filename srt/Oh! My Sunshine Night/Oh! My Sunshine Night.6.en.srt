1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,280
You're so cool.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,740
You always follow your heart.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,520
If you have feelings for someone,

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,620
go for it.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,500
Only if it were that easy.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,840
Rain,

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,700
I...

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,800
What's wrong?

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,660
Let's say it's nothing for now.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,080
I have to be make sure.

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,460
Okay.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,860
Leave me be.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,180
Please.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,700
You should rest.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,180
I'll be right here.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Why grandma has to bring this dish to that place?

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,520
The bad guy must be there.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,100
Are you okay?

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,060
How dare you.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,060
You can't escape me now.

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,420
Don't come closer.

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,820
No!

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,440
Don't!

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,740
You spy!

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,900
This little?

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,420
You got the nerve coming here.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,420
Here I come!

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,120
Ouch!

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,820
You spy!

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,800
Are you a mad dog?

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,180
Die!

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
Your gun sucks.

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,860
The bullet's stuck.

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,540
You can't hurt me.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,320
You challenged me?

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,580
Where you going?!

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hiya!

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,380
Come down here you spy.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
Come out.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,460
Freeze!

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,540
Don't move.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
You stepped on a land mine.

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,420
You're lying.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,980
No!

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,280
Ouch.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,600
Damn!

47
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,700
Hurry up, slowpoke.

48
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,940
I'm being hurry.

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,140
Your feet are so big.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
I'll push you.

51
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,220
Your feet are big,

52
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,320
and you're heavy.

53
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,100
Damn.

54
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
Are you a bigfoot?

55
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,100
Isn't it good? I can scare people.

56
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,520
No one dares to bully me.

57
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,440
That's too big.

58
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,900
One kick and I'll fly away.

59
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,160
Nonsense.

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
That camera's for observing the enemy.

61
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,180
A toy?

62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,100
Real camera. My father sent it to me.

63
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,980
Wow! I could see my house in Bangkok.

64
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,960
This one.

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,900
The enemies are approaching.

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,720
Raise your weapon.

67
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,280
Kim, roger that.

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,160
Hey!

69
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,480
Hey! You little prick. Better beware.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,360
I'll bomb your house.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,300
Fire!

72
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,300
That hurts!

73
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,680
It hurts!

74
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,540
Ouch!

75
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,820
Ouch!

76
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,000
They have guns.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,780
Retreat!

78
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,500
Don't run!

79
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,040
Come back!

80
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Payoo.

81
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,740
Father.

82
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,580
I knocked but you didn't reply.

83
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,340
Are you okay now?

84
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,960
You haven't gone out for a few days.

85
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,640
Oh.

86
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm fine now.

87
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,080
I was just tired.

88
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,480
So I slept like a log.

89
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm feeling better.

90
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Do you need something?

91
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,260
Nothing.

92
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,860
Now that you woke up,
go take a bath.

93
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,940
Are you close with him?

94
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,380
He's cute.

95
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,380
Sun,

96
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,520
want to have lunch with me after class?

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,100
- Sure.
- Baibua!

98
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,032
Butler Santi,

99
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,932
shrimp congee was delicious.

100
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:48,952
Thank you.

101
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:54,352
Why don't Kim join us?

102
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,812
He said he'll eat at the university.

103
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,012
What?

104
00:09:58,612 --> 00:09:59,292
This kid

105
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,152
is always weird.

106
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,512
Just let him go sometimes.

107
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,352
You always spoil him.

108
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:12,792
At least, Rain isn't this stubborn.

109
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,552
Or I'd be psycho by now.

110
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,892
You have to tell him

111
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,732
to stop using motorcycle.

112
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:23,772
I told him.

113
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:31,352
Hmm...

114
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:33,932
When's our villa inspection appointment?

115
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,012
Next week.

116
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,212
After Master Rain's match,

117
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:38,992
we'll depart the next day.

118
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:40,752
Oh, okay.

119
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,512
Wow.

120
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:43,532
You're excellent.

121
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,452
I can't do anything without you.

122
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:51,912
When's the meeting with Sookwan?

123
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:53,952
At noon.

124
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:56,812
Butler Santi,

125
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,392
please prepare lunch for Dr. Sookwan.

126
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:00,372
I did.

127
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,992
You don't have class today, right?

128
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,112
Yes.

129
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,512
What can I do for you?

130
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,272
Drive Master Kim to university.

131
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,232
But...

132
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,692
Master Kim likes to ride his motorcycle to university.

133
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,712
Our master doesn't like that.

134
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,052
Okay.

135
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:42,972
What master doesn't like,

136
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,192
I won't do it.

137
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:47,612
You too.

138
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:51,952
Okay.

139
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,252
Fork with spoon.

140
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:07,992
Humans are so clever

141
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,212
to invent these stuffs.

142
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,932
I guess these are made to defy nature.

143
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,292
What's wrong with nature?

144
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:29,912
I don't think we can defy nature

145
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:31,612
all the time.

146
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:37,232
Sometimes we must obey it.

147
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:09,752
Oh! Payoo.

148
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,772
You don't have class today.

149
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,792
You don't have to drive for me.

150
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,032
I can go by myself.

151
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:18,652
Master isn't pleased

152
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,732
that you ride motorbike.

153
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:23,252
I think

154
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,732
he's never pleased with anything I do.

155
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:28,592
I don't think so.

156
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,072
I guess he think it's dangerous.

157
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:33,332
Everyone rides a motorbike.

158
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:36,832
They

159
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,052
might not have a choice.

160
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:42,072
So,

161
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,292
do I have one?

162
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:47,732
Yes.

163
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:51,112
Okay.

164
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,012
Then,

165
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:53,012
fine.

166
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,632
Let's go.

167
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:07,032
Oh.

168
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,772
After school,
I'll go home by myself.

169
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:11,852
Okay.

170
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:46,812
Kim.

171
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:02,172
I thought you'll skip this class.

172
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:05,952
Hell no.

173
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,332
By the way,

174
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,052
how did you come today?

175
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,072
Payoo drove me here.

176
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,112
Why?

177
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,692
Nothing.

178
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,512
Suspicious.

179
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:22,492
Oh.

180
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,952
Want to have lunch with me this noon?

181
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:28,472
The class hasn't even started,
and you talk about lunch already?

182
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:29,872
I'm hungry.

183
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:31,492
Okay.

184
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,432
Hello, students.

185
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:42,212
I didn't expect

186
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,692
to see you guys in this morning class.

187
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,212
Well, it's almost the end of semester.

188
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,452
You come for a reason, right?

189
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,532
If you want a participation score,

190
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:52,772
there's none.

191
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,492
Let's talk about new score criteria.

192
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:04,652
Oh!

193
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,552
Hello, Sun.

194
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,712
Why don't you come tomorrow?

195
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:10,392
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:12,112
Late again.

197
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:18,272
Don't say I'm late.

198
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,872
You came after prof.,
so what does that mean?

199
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:23,892
It means

200
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,072
he came before me.

201
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:26,032
Okay?

202
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,392
Hi, Baibua.

203
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:31,112
Baibua,

204
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,432
You're friend him with?

205
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:35,132
Why?

206
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,872
He's cute.

207
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,492
I'm not you

208
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,852
who can live alone in this world.

209
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:45,932
Sun,

210
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:48,972
I didn't expect you to come early.

211
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,032
Is that a compliment?

212
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:52,332
Whatever works for you.

213
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,032
Want to have lunch with me after class?

214
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:58,632
- Sure.
- Baibua!

215
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,212
Hey!

216
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,352
Quiet!

217
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,352
This is classroom.

218
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,332
The criteria are changed.

219
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:08,432
Look.

220
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,472
Hurry up!

221
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,292
More precise!

222
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:30,952
Nice.

223
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:32,592
Good job.

224
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:37,372
Rain.

225
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:38,572
Well done.

226
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,092
Be careful.

227
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,092
Are you okay now?

228
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:42,272
I'm fine.

229
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:45,992
He's got magic medicine.

230
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,112
Everyone,

231
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:50,972
keep up with this momentum.

232
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,272
Other teams won't beat us.

233
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:54,312
Yes, coach.

234
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,072
Why are you here?

235
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:23,332
Why don't you rest?

236
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,672
Well,

237
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,352
I feel better now.

238
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:28,712
A lot better.

239
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:31,212
Are you Wolverine

240
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,852
with healing factor?

241
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:36,772
You don't have class, right?

242
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:39,472
Er...

243
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:40,852
Yes.

244
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:43,812
Why...

245
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:47,032
Oh, I...

246
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,192
drove master Kim here.

247
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:51,812
And I brought this for you

248
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:52,912
in case you need it.

249
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,892
I want to ask you that

250
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,892
do you need anything else?

251
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:08,192
Yeah.

252
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:10,572
What do you need?

253
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,072
I'll get it for you.

254
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:16,932
You.

255
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,672
Just kidding.

256
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,152
If I need anything,

257
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:30,372
I'll surely text you.

258
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,192
I always do that, right?

259
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:35,372
Yes.

260
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:41,612
What's wrong?

261
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,852
Nothing.

262
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:49,752
Then, I'll excuse myself.

263
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:51,732
Master Kim will go home by himself.

264
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:53,092
Wait.

265
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:57,832
Now that you're here,

266
00:19:58,652 --> 00:19:59,752
help me with stretching.

267
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:03,872
Me?

268
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:07,872
Look.

269
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:09,992
No one else's around here.

270
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,352
It must be you.

271
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,092
You said it yourself that you don't me to be injured.

272
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:19,712
If you don't help me,

273
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,272
I might be injured.

274
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:26,472
Okay?

275
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:31,312
Okay.

276
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,372
I'm ready.

277
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:34,732
It's just a stretch.

278
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:39,372
Wait, Sun.

279
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:43,312
Do you want to join our band?

280
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:48,692
Wait.

281
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:05,449
Come.

282
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,349
Stretch your arm.

283
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:10,329
Fold down.

284
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:15,129
Good?

285
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:15,969
Yeah.

286
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:30,449
Now lie down on your back.

287
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,709
I'll stretch your legs.

288
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:41,689
I'll start with this.

289
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,409
And then

290
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:27,749
Stand up please.

291
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:33,029
Bend down.

292
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:34,309
I'll help.

293
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:50,769
Thanks.

294
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:52,509
I feel better now.

295
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:54,029
Great.

296
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,089
Can I leave now?

297
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:58,209
I told you

298
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,309
to do whatever

299
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:02,909
you want to do.

300
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,329
No need to ask me for permission.

301
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,809
But you are...

302
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:18,849
You're not my servant.

303
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,709
And I'm not your master.

304
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,029
Remember this.

305
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:30,589
Okay.

306
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,369
How are you, Payoo?

307
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,649
I texted you but...

308
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:52,009
you didn't read.

309
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,169
I was scared.

310
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:55,209
Oh.

311
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:56,609
I'm better now.

312
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,049
I'm sorry

313
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:00,369
I slept like a log

314
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,609
because of the medicine.

315
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:03,349
It's okay.

316
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:04,669
Here.

317
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,009
In case you're hungry.

318
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,069
Thank you, Baibua.

319
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,309
Then...

320
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:20,609
I'll go now.

321
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,529
Such a long walk between classes

322
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,609
like playing musical chairs.

323
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:09,069
That's beautiful.

324
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,189
Oh.

325
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,149
Why come so early?

326
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:22,429
It's an hour before class.

327
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:23,349
Because

328
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,749
this class is crowded,

329
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:28,629
we need to reserve seats.

330
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,949
Oh!

331
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:33,929
Kim.

332
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:37,109
Prof. Wannasingh calls for an emergency meeting.

333
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:44,849
I got the text too.

334
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:48,669
Let's go.

335
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,009
Sun.

336
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:53,529
Please reserve the seats for us.

337
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,189
We have emergency meeting.

338
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:57,369
Sure.

339
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:58,369
Thanks.

340
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:00,209
Let's go.

341
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:09,949
Hey.

342
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:10,889
Shun.

343
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:12,449
Reserve seats for me.

344
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:13,589
I'll be back.

345
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:16,409
What?

346
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:20,929
Where you going?

347
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,969
I'll be back soon.

348
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:25,889
Hey.

349
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:27,549
Sun.

350
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:28,629
Sun!

351
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,369
Jeweled tea bag from Boodles Jewelers.

352
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:44,369
That's right.

353
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:52,409
Smells good.

354
00:26:58,849 --> 00:26:59,709
Perfect.

355
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:08,049
I've talked with the villa's administrator.

356
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,309
Luckily,

357
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:13,789
he's my friend from Harvard university.

358
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:15,989
It should be an easy negotiation.

359
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:18,869
What a promising start.

360
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:23,649
I sent you my schedule.

361
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:24,629
Yeah.

362
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,089
Santi notified me that we should be available next week.

363
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,469
And...

364
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:36,149
Kim and Rain will join us, right?

365
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,829
Rain's rugby match is ending this week, then we go.

366
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,349
But I don't think Kim will join us.

367
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:45,849
Nice.

368
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:47,849
We can make a decision together

369
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:49,489
at the site of villa.

370
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:51,189
Yes.

371
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,709
I love working with you guys.

372
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:57,909
Us too.

373
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:14,829
Everyone's here?

374
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,369
I was informed that Tew broke his arm

375
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,389
in a motorcycle accident last night.

376
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,589
But he's safe now

377
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,349
and got discharged.

378
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:33,529
Professor.

379
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,669
What about

380
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:38,749
our performance at the rugby match ceremony?

381
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,609
What should we do?

382
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,729
Since we have no guitarist,

383
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,449
we can't rehearse.

384
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,589
We have to cancel the show.

385
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,149
And let other clubs perform instead.

386
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:56,089
But

387
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,989
We worked very hard.

388
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:00,569
And

389
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,069
Kim

390
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,869
practiced his solo with Tew for so long.

391
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:08,889
They were so in sync.

392
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,789
I don't know what to do either.

393
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:14,109
It's an accident.

394
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,969
Nobody expects this.

395
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,129
Can we do anything else?

396
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,609
I've been thinking

397
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,089
but couldn't find any solutions.

398
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:31,249
Then,

399
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:33,049
that's it.

400
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:36,169
I'll notify the committees about this.

401
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,309
So that they can replace us with other clubs.

402
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,169
Okay?

403
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:50,069
Sun!

404
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:53,729
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,089
It's my fault.

406
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:57,429
Wait.

407
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,409
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:01,649
I didn't mean to...

409
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:06,829
Do you still want to join our club?

410
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:14,249
Want to audition for our band?

411
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:18,129
Pardon?

412
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,609
Do you want to join us?

413
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:39,489
Well?

414
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:54,209
Sun.

415
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:55,269
Ready?

416
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,209
Deep breath.

417
00:30:59,429 --> 00:30:59,769
Okay.

418
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:01,149
Okay.

419
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:22,769
Wait!

420
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:29,889
Did you drive here?

421
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,009
I don't want to take taxi home.

422
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:33,209
Your friend

423
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,369
really go all in.

424
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:04,078
Wait!

425
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:23,178
Sun.

426
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:28,938
Great job.

427
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,198
Well done!

428
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,178
I'm not disappointed.

429
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:37,698
That was good.

430
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:41,118
Sun.

431
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,798
It's not that you're replacing Tew.

432
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:47,598
But

433
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:53,598
You passed the audition for this band
with your own talent.

434
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,398
Really?

435
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:56,718
Yeah.

436
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:00,618
Why so quiet?

437
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,578
Let's give our newest member a warm welcome!

438
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:07,158
Thank you.

439
00:35:07,158 --> 00:35:07,738
Sun!

440
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:08,538
Thank you.

441
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:10,298
Thank you so much.

442
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:11,578
Thanks.

443
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:14,118
Okay then.

444
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,118
Give him a break.

445
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:20,298
The song we will perform at the ceremony

446
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:23,938
needs a duet between cello an guitar.

447
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:25,198
That means

448
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:25,958
Kim

449
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,078
Sun

450
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,538
need to rehearse together rigorously

451
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,338
for our band.

452
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,898
I leave it in your hands, all of you.

453
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,618
Yes, prof.

454
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:37,318
Nice.

455
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,238
Now then,

456
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,858
I'll inform the committees

457
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,618
that we're ready.

458
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:47,738
More than ever.

459
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:50,078
- Toy.
- Yes.

460
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:50,918
Please continue.

461
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:51,578
Sure.

462
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:57,118
Now.

463
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:58,438
Guys.

464
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:01,698
Let's follow our dreams.

465
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:03,078
Come.

466
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:21,338
Then

467
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:22,858
See you tomorrow.

468
00:37:23,638 --> 00:37:24,198
Do you best.

469
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,918
Thanks, Baibua.

470
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:28,198
My pleasure.

471
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:30,058
Well then.

472
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:30,978
Bye.

473
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,298
See ya.

474
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:34,018
Bye.

475
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:36,518
Kim.

476
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:39,618
I'll go to the green house.

477
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:41,358
Okay.

478
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:43,998
Baibua.

479
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:51,038
Is it okay?

480
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:53,618
What do you mean?

481
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:55,418
What's okay?

482
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,498
Uh...

483
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:02,818
My plant.

484
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,538
Oh!

485
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,158
Apple tree?

486
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:08,998
Why didn't you say so?

487
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:11,318
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

488
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,518
It'll survive.

489
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:14,038
See you later.

490
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:16,138
Bye.

491
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,858
Thank you so much.

492
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:27,878
For?

493
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:29,298
Uh...

494
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:31,518
Everything.

495
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,138
What?

496
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,638
For helping me audition.

497
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:43,058
It's for the band.

498
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:44,878
Not for you.

499
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:48,958
Thank you anyway

500
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:50,918
about that too.

501
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:54,578
What?

502
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:56,618
Apple tree.

503
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:03,798
It's for our world.

504
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:06,358
Not for you.

505
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:13,658
Can't you say something nicer?

506
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,418
You stubborn.

507
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:28,918
You can ignore me all you want.

508
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:32,538
I want to know

509
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:34,858
talking to me

510
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:38,098
devalues you that much?

511
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:42,798
No.

512
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:45,778
Then, why avoiding me?

513
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:50,258
I'm just busy.

514
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:57,558
To deny by saying you're busy,

515
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:00,278
do you know why you say that?

516
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:04,998
Because it's the least painful excuse.

517
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:09,098
But for people who know its real meaning,

518
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,178
it hurts like hell.

519
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:24,878
In your eyes,

520
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,498
if I am that disgusting,

521
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,318
I'm sorry.

522
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:38,258
Did you drive here?

523
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:46,378
I don't want to take taxi home.

524
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,698
You have to do that much?

525
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:08,078
Your friend

526
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:09,978
really went all in.

527
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,458
He thinks that it's worth it.

528
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:18,458
Thank you about that day.

529
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:20,698
You warned me about the zombie.

530
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:21,998
Oh.

531
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:23,198
How was he?

532
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:24,878
Cold as ice?

533
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:28,998
Pretty much.

534
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,138
I always see you

535
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:36,778
carrying this.

536
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:39,978
What?

537
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:41,758
It doesn't suit me?

538
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:43,078
Not like that.

539
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:45,938
Why do you care if it suits you?

540
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:47,438
It's all about this.

541
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:50,498
Yeah.

542
00:41:51,438 --> 00:41:52,258
Right.

543
00:41:56,258 --> 00:41:56,638
Come.

544
00:41:58,078 --> 00:41:58,378
What?

545
00:41:58,838 --> 00:41:59,358
I'm Petch.

546
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:03,078
I'm Sun.

547
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:05,578
Now we're not strangers anymore.

548
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:07,058
I'll help.

549
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:10,878
Thank you.

550
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:12,458
My pleasure.

551
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:52,218
Do you best.

552
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:53,438
Can't wait to hear it.

553
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,118
Be my partner today.

554
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:01,398
This is a practice!

555
00:43:01,658 --> 00:43:02,938
Not a murder scene.

556
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:04,458
It's my dream

557
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:06,158
that you'll never understand.

558
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:08,618
Wake up.

559
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:11,378
How much do I need to do to satisfy you?

560
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:16,238
Hey.

561
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,638
Kimhan.

562
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:22,118
Hello, prof.

563
00:45:23,058 --> 00:45:25,278
You skipped the previous class.

564
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:28,618
I had a big rehearsal.

565
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,778
You need to focus.

566
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:32,978
About to graduate, right?

567
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:34,978
Almost there.

568
00:45:36,518 --> 00:45:37,038
Yeah.

569
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,418
I'm almost late!

570
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:46,478
Wait!

571
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,118
Wait!

572
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:55,218
What the hell.

573
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:57,438
So heartless!
