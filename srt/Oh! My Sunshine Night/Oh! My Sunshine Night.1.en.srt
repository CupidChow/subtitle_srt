1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,220
I've asked myself so many times.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,640
Who...

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,500
Who was I born for?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,300
For family…

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,820
For myself…

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,480
Or for someone

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,340
I've been waiting for.

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,220
Then I found the answer

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,060
for that question I've asked myself.

10
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,080
I was born

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,880
just because it's been destined.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,200
Even if I want to go left

13
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,300
or right,

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,800
in the end,

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,000
There will be a voice controlling me

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,220
To do anything it said.

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,160
But just once in my life

18
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,760
that I want it to stop.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,440
And let me control my own destiny.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,940
Whether it's right

21
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,900
or wrong,

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,840
I get to choose it myself.

23
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,760
Oh!

24
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
He's so brilliant.

25
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm glad you're here on time.

26
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,980
I've been here from the start.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
How could I miss it.

28
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,560
That's perfect! Kim.

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,260
You certainly did your best!

30
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,260
So cool, dude.

31
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,060
That's our club's ace!

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,340
Cool.

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
Well done, Kim.

34
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,940
Thank you, prof.

35
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,460
My little brother.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,100
He can achieve anything he desires.

37
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
You're flawless.

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,920
But your younger brother

39
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,800
Actually,

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
he has a lot of flaws.

41
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,440
Some parts of the song are weird.

42
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,260
His fingers

43
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,640
couldn't keep up with his heart.

44
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,760
But I like it.

45
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,240
He's got potential.

46
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,900
Your flaws give different sensation.

47
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,900
It's like

48
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,000
a chef who doesn't follow exact recipe.

49
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,120
but instead creates a whole now taste.

50
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,320
Not everyone can do it.

51
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,700
But you just did it.

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,420
The music from your cello

53
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,440
is like no one else.

54
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,040
It tells stories.

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,640
It depicts the story of your life.

56
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
And everyone can feel it.

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,440
And now… the name of the person who's going to be

58
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
our country's representative is in my hand.

59
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,820
I know

60
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
being a country's representative

61
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,440
doesn't make you as happy as getting to play

62
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,740
with Stjepan Hauser in the final round, right?

63
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,340
I think I know why

64
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,080
you withdrew last year too.

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,040
The cellist winner of this year's competition to be a representative

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,200
and join World Federation of International Music Competitions or WFIMC

67
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,660
in Geneva, Switzerland is…

68
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,740
Kimhan Kannakul!

69
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,820
Yahoo!

70
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,920
Next,

71
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,220
Please welcome the chairman of Thailand Western Music Association

72
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Mr. Chaiwat Pongsakul

73
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,160
to present the award.

74
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,580
What time now?

75
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,500
Crap!

76
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,900
30 minutes left!

77
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,780
Will I be on time?

78
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,040
How can I forget!

79
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,980
My dear son.

80
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,120
You did it, brother!

81
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,220
Your dream is coming true.

82
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,480
Not happy?

83
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,380
He is.

84
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Very much so.

85
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,140
Congratulations.

86
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,840
You made some reputations before you graduate

87
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,120
For our band and our university.

88
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,020
From now on, you'll have to practice at the club more often.

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,900
You can't always do as your please anymore.

90
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,420
Look at your brother.

91
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Even though he's graduating, he always helps us.

92
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,360
I think

93
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,300
We should go back to the club.

94
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,320
Okay, let's go.

95
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Go.

96
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,720
Ouch!

97
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,940
Petch!

98
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,340
You sneaky bastard.

99
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,560
You dropped your guard.

100
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,060
Let me try again.

101
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,220
Come.

102
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,100
Let's do it.

103
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,120
Excuse me!

104
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,060
I'm sorry!

105
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,040
Sorry!

106
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,980
Hey, be careful of zombie over there!

107
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,480
Thank you!

108
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,340
What?

109
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,600
Let's do it.

110
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm already late so...

111
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,040
I'll just practice.

112
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,780
H...Hello!

113
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm Sun.

114
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,000
Third year student

115
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,420
From Faculty of Fine Arts, Western Music Major.

116
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,820
Even though I just transferred here,

117
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,380
I want to be a part of this band

118
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,520
to do what I love.

119
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,580
Uh...

120
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,440
Well...

121
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,440
Ain't it funny?

122
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,020
Well...

123
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,540
I was late for class.

124
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,880
So I wanted to audition for the band.

125
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,500
I saw this room vacant.

126
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,840
But...

127
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,820
I almost finished.

128
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,260
So I want to do my best.

129
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,880
Do whatever you like.

130
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,580
No one cares that much.

131
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,260
Eh?

132
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,340
Am I that bad?

133
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,280
I don't care.

134
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,080
Moreover,

135
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,020
Today audition is canceled.

136
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,300
Because there was a cellist competition at the auditorium.

137
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,020
Didn't see the notice?

138
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,320
Or e-mail?

139
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,280
Well...

140
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
I... uh...

141
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,580
It's nothing.

142
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,020
Why are your feet so big?

143
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,300
Ouch!

144
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:03,983
Wait!

145
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:10,843
What?

146
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,063
I think you look familiar.

147
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,863
Have we ever met?

148
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:18,783
I think...

149
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:21,303
I met you...

150
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,023
somewhere...

151
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:33,223
Never.

152
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:37,383
Wait!

153
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:40,683
What else?

154
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,143
What the hell?

155
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:52,683
Why...

156
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:54,683
are your feet so big?

157
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,603
Piss off!

158
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:04,963
Ouch!

159
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,203
I warned you

160
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:29,863
- Not to do it.
- You didn't have to step on me.

161
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,783
Watch your mouth.

162
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,143
Really?

163
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,183
So arrogant.

164
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:52,743
Think you're so cool?

165
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,943
Such a cold-hearted person.

166
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:58,463
Or even lifeless.

167
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,223
Is he maybe...

168
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,123
The one who's called...

169
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:08,263
Zombie?!

170
00:17:22,823 --> 00:17:23,763
Your phone.

171
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,683
If you're not gonna answer anyone's calls,

172
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:29,683
Then throw it away.

173
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,063
It's in the car.

174
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:37,743
Typical you.

175
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,403
Don't you want to change yourself or care about anything?

176
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:48,603
What can I do for you?

177
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:50,563
I'm in a hurry.

178
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,143
Need to get stuffs.

179
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:54,923
I...

180
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:58,003
I want to congratulate you.

181
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,423
Been looking all over.

182
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:09,363
Thanks.

183
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:26,483
Kim!

184
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:32,963
The man I'm dating

185
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,643
said that if I graduate,

186
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,083
he'll bring me to study abroad with him.

187
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:42,983
Only a few months left.

188
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,183
It's been a while.

189
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:47,723
Has he been good to you?

190
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,643
Just that?

191
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,183
You don't feel anything?

192
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:03,983
That's the point!

193
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:08,383
He's the one you choose.

194
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,403
Tell me

195
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,283
All this time.

196
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,803
What was our relationship?

197
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,423
Have you ever had feelings for me?

198
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:25,623
Aren’t you tired of being alone?

199
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:33,983
You already know

200
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,503
That I never fought my feelings

201
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,023
for anyone.

202
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,563
I'm not ready for anyone.

203
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:43,523
Meen.

204
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:51,983
Wait!

205
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,083
Do it.

206
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:10,363
Meen!

207
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,763
I've always followed you.

208
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:18,583
Since the freshmen year.

209
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,423
But you've never opened up to me.

210
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,563
You don't know anything about love.

211
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:31,523
You don't even have faith

212
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:33,503
In love.

213
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,463
It's not that I don't know love.

214
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,323
or I don't believe it.

215
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,003
I just won't open the front door.

216
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,783
To keep my good memory of someone

217
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:58,683
From flying away.

218
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:00,663
That's it.

219
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,123
Who's there?!

220
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,063
Uh...

221
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:42,423
I...

222
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:44,043
Didn't hear a word.

223
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:44,783
Just...

224
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,303
Bought a drink.

225
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:48,583
I'm leaving.

226
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:50,063
Bye.

227
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:50,843
Wait!

228
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:54,883
He must be mad.

229
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,903
What about your stuff?

230
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,043
Oh!

231
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,363
Yeah... I forgot.

232
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,503
Shouldn't he be mad?

233
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:16,923
This is real zombie.

234
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:19,023
What?

235
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,483
N...Nothing!

236
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,703
You're wet.

237
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,943
Your coat too...

238
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:34,723
And...

239
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,043
Can't go out like that.

240
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,123
Let me help.

241
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:42,703
No need!

242
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,163
I'm fine.

243
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:47,543
Hey! You!

244
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:49,963
You!

245
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,543
Hey.

246
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:57,463
Give it back.

247
00:22:58,063 --> 00:22:59,363
It's not that important.

248
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:01,023
No.

249
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,683
It'll dry soon.

250
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,363
And you can wear it.

251
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,683
A cool, handsome person like you

252
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:09,603
Wouldn't look good in wet clothes.

253
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:10,723
I don't care.

254
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:12,583
I can take care of myself.

255
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,043
Hey.

256
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:17,943
You don't have to keep cool all the time.

257
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:20,303
You're still wet.

258
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,563
Learn to accept help sometimes

259
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,843
I want to help because you're my fellow student.

260
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:27,863
But...

261
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:32,663
If you're so kind, then please advise me about the audition.

262
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,283
I just meant well.

263
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:36,683
No need!

264
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,063
Why so hurry?

265
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,203
It wouldn't take up so much of your time.

266
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,563
Just a second. It'll dry soon.

267
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:50,083
Move.

268
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:51,463
Ouch!

269
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,603
I warned you.

270
00:24:00,123 --> 00:24:01,043
Stay away.

271
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:04,343
I just wanted to help.

272
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,783
Is this how you repay a kindness?

273
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:20,683
What the hell?

274
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:22,963
What a great birthday.

275
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,643
So lifeless and cold-hearted.

276
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:28,863
Fit for the zombie name.

277
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:39,303
Hello, Shun.

278
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:51,483
Wow!

279
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,223
Hurry up, young master!

280
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:56,883
Been busy watching music competition, right?

281
00:24:57,823 --> 00:25:00,663
You still tease me about this until now?

282
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,403
My brother competed in that program!

283
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,063
So,

284
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:08,343
Will you choose sports or music?

285
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:09,563
Make up your mind.

286
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:14,243
I'm versatile. I don't have to choose.

287
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:17,983
Wait...

288
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,283
You still talk about music and sports...

289
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:22,343
Right?

290
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:27,163
How else?

291
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:29,103
You're nosy.

292
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:31,843
I'm not.

293
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,683
But someone asked me.

294
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:36,743
Who?

295
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:38,423
You know.

296
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,563
It's those freshmen,

297
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,783
Who's been following you.

298
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,843
So they know what to do.

299
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,403
Oh!

300
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:49,483
Those freshmen

301
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:51,623
are so cute!

302
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:54,403
Match day is coming. Practice comes first.

303
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:55,943
Other things later.

304
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:00,683
Aye, aye, captain.

305
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:06,263
Let's go!

306
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,463
Nice.

307
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,543
Where have you been?

308
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,423
Meen has been looking for you.

309
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,523
Don't tell me...

310
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:35,163
She's still following you?

311
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:40,083
Because you are too kind

312
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:42,083
and sympathize with everyone.

313
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:45,283
Eventually, you're in trouble again.

314
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,103
Kim.

315
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,003
What?

316
00:26:57,863 --> 00:26:59,623
Forget what I said.

317
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:11,323
How is it?

318
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:15,723
Well...

319
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:16,983
Um...

320
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:21,543
Your plant has no chlorophyll.

321
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,743
If not natural,

322
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,923
it must be genetic mistakes.

323
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:31,503
Snow...

324
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,523
was born from mistake?

325
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:36,583
Wait?

326
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:37,363
You...

327
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:39,823
You think it's born from miracle?

328
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:41,203
Wake up!

329
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:43,083
You read too much comics.

330
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:44,923
Come back to reality.

331
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:50,283
Don't believe in miracle?

332
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:52,603
No.

333
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,723
I believe in mutation.

334
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:58,823
The reason that this plant is white instead of green

335
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:02,243
Must be some kind mutation.

336
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:05,383
For what?

337
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:07,783
For survival.

338
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:11,103
Your plant just doesn't want to die.

339
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:12,003
Get it?

340
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,083
Who'd want it to die?

341
00:28:22,823 --> 00:28:23,923
Actually...

342
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:25,383
You can leave it here.

343
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,003
I'll take care of it.

344
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:30,243
No need.

345
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:32,743
It should be with me.

346
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,243
Wow!

347
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:38,243
You even sympathize the plants.

348
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:44,763
Oh, Kim.

349
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,183
Are you free now?

350
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,583
I guess.

351
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:51,983
What's wrong?

352
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,303
Well...

353
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:59,143
Can you take my CD box set from the coffee shop behind the gym

354
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:02,523
to Prof. Wannasingh’s room?

355
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:06,003
I have a seminar tomorrow.

356
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:07,883
And I haven't finished preparing.

357
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,283
Or...

358
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:14,143
You won't let a petite girl like me

359
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,243
Carry heavy stuff around.

360
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,063
Right?

361
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,383
Please.

362
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:20,983
Baibua.

363
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,603
You don't have to do this.

364
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:26,683
Fine.

365
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,563
I'll take care of it.

366
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,903
Call the coffee shop for me.

367
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:32,603
Thank you.

368
00:29:41,403 --> 00:29:45,063
A lifeless guy like that can be kind sometimes.

369
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,163
Not so many people

370
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,303
would understand you.

371
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:09,583
Thanks.

372
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:20,343
Hey, Sun.

373
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,043
I think...

374
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,243
You should go to hospital.

375
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:28,983
I'm fine. Don't worry.

376
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:30,103
Hey.

377
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,703
I have...

378
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:34,023
This.

379
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,283
Apple?

380
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:40,583
How could it help with your heart symptoms?

381
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:42,303
Haven't you heard?

382
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:45,343
It can help with vasoconstriction.

383
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,623
Or widen the blood vessels for the heart.

384
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,463
You won't understand anyway.

385
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,943
I just went to hospital last week.

386
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:54,903
I'll tell him about my symptom next time.

387
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:57,703
Next time,

388
00:30:57,703 --> 00:31:00,203
If anything happens, don't hesitate to call me.

389
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,263
You should've called me this morning.

390
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:04,703
I blacked out.

391
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:06,383
Be careful.

392
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:07,743
Okay.

393
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,563
By the way,

394
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,203
I just remembered.

395
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:15,803
The one you told me.

396
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:18,823
Must be Kim.

397
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:21,583
Emotionless,

398
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,723
Tall,

399
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:24,743
And...

400
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:27,063
A member of music club.

401
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:29,843
Must be him.

402
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:31,723
But...

403
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,863
It's been almost a year, you haven't met him yet?

404
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:36,443
Well...

405
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,303
Maybe.

406
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,183
Must be from SEC1.

407
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,243
Why do you talk about him?

408
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,943
Okay, never mind.

409
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:48,363
Right now...

410
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:50,503
Help me with my project.

411
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,763
I've come for Baibua's box set.

412
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,003
- Sun.
- What?

413
00:31:59,023 --> 00:31:59,743
Is it him?

414
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,363
Big university, but such a small world.

415
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:30,712
It's perfect

416
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:33,992
That you choose Rain as your inheritor.

417
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:36,112
Especially, of our business.

418
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:39,932
I trained him since he's young.

419
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:41,912
Maybe a little too optimistic.

420
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:45,092
The world is always beautiful.

421
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:46,652
For the youths.

422
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:49,292
He needs tricks up his sleeve.

423
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:52,492
I believe that...

424
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:54,552
You can teach him.

425
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,832
Kim isn't weaker than his brother.

426
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,072
But you didn't choose him.

427
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,672
There's too much cold business tension.

428
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:08,832
I want him to be a warm corner for our home.

429
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,312
As far as I know...

430
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:17,092
He seems to be cold rather than warm.

431
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,492
He's just different from Rain.

432
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:23,632
These brothers grew up together

433
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:24,892
Without anything alike.

434
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,212
They're good in their own way.

435
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:30,752
A warrior was born to fight.

436
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:34,592
A poet was born for peace and beauty.

437
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,172
So, the villa in the north that we are going to buy.

438
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:46,892
I’ll let Rain

439
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,692
Negotiate by himself.

440
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:52,812
I'll look forward to see his skill.

441
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:55,492
Right now...

442
00:33:56,352 --> 00:34:00,392
People want more vacation home and villa every year.

443
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,432
I'm glad we were in this business before anyone else.

444
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:06,412
Profit is huge from just buying and selling!

445
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,752
I'm proud of you Doctor.

446
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:12,292
You're so good at negotiation.

447
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:15,272
More opportunities await.

448
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,872
A lot more beautiful home to buy.

449
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:22,692
Don't make me disappoint by your heirs.

450
00:34:26,152 --> 00:34:26,912
Cheers.

451
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,812
Dessert's ready.

452
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:53,252
You have me gain weight every time I'm here, butler Santi.

453
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,032
If you stay for dinner,

454
00:34:56,032 --> 00:35:00,212
I'll prepare southern Italian grilled salad for you.

455
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:02,892
You know me well.

456
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,432
I just told Ms. Orranee that...

457
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:09,252
Unfortunately, I have another business meeting this evening.

458
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:10,032
Sir.

459
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,272
Santi knows everyone well.

460
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:16,272
Without him,

461
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:20,712
We wouldn't feel at home.

462
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,672
He knows everything

463
00:35:22,852 --> 00:35:25,732
From housework to our business.

464
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:27,852
Not just that,

465
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:30,812
His son, Payoo, also helps us.

466
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:47,532
Mister!

467
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:48,872
Mister Kimhan?

468
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:51,152
I'm from Thai Celebrities website.

469
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:54,792
I interviewed your father, the real estate billionaire in Thailand.

470
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,792
Remember me? From three years ago.

471
00:35:57,592 --> 00:35:58,932
I have no exciting stories.

472
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:01,772
I still remember your red shoes story.

473
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,532
That you wore one of it.

474
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:05,972
There are a lot of views on Youtube.

475
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:07,532
It's very funny.

476
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:11,572
It's my real childhood memory.

477
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:13,352
I didn't mean to be funny.

478
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:14,732
But it went viral.

479
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,872
The repetition makes it funnier.

480
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:19,952
My friends shared it.

481
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:31,392
Number 10.

482
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:32,672
My brother.

483
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:34,532
Mr. Rain?

484
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,072
Yeah.

485
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:39,052
Interview him.

486
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,492
And you'll forget about me.

487
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:43,552
Why?

488
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:45,992
Just do it.

489
00:36:47,192 --> 00:36:47,952
You'll get an answer.

490
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:49,572
Okay...

491
00:36:58,732 --> 00:36:59,732
Looking for me?

492
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:07,472
Payoo, where you going?

493
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:08,212
No Judo practice?

494
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:11,732
Too late now.

495
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,212
Black-belt is enough?

496
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:16,652
Part time or Rain?

497
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:19,212
Young master.

498
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:23,592
See you tomorrow, Em.

499
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:24,412
Okay.

500
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:26,992
Don't forget it's morning class tomorrow.

501
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,412
- Sure
- Come on time please.

502
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:31,572
Here.

503
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:33,712
The structure's ready.

504
00:37:33,972 --> 00:37:35,392
You do the rest.

505
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:37,092
Okay. Okay.

506
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:52,632
Hello.

507
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,692
I've come for Baibua's box set.

508
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:57,592
Oh, Baibua's.

509
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,792
She told me about it.

510
00:37:58,792 --> 00:37:59,572
A moment, please.

511
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,252
- Sun.
- What?

512
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:08,412
Is it him?

513
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:14,592
Big university.

514
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:16,812
But such a small world.

515
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:21,572
Really cold aura.

516
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,492
Also emotionless.

517
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:27,152
So different from his brother.

518
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:29,732
You know his brother?

519
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,232
Who is he?

520
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,692
Total 1,200 baht.

521
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:43,952
Well.

522
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,892
Done? Let's get going. So they can close the shop.

523
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:47,632
Fine, I'm done.

524
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:53,152
We can't accept credit card right now.

525
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:55,952
Can you pay by cash or bank transfer?

526
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:59,472
I've got no cash on me.

527
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:01,652
Wait a minute.

528
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:10,312
My battery's dead.

529
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,152
1,200 baht, right?

530
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,372
- Yes
- I'll pay along with my order.

531
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:22,392
Thank you.

532
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,052
Don't say I'm meddlesome.

533
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,612
I just lent you so she can close the shop.

534
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:32,932
Pay me back at the university.

535
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,072
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

536
00:39:37,032 --> 00:39:37,632
Oh.

537
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:40,332
Don't worry. It's no interest loan.

538
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:58,732
What now?

539
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:01,112
See you later.

540
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:18,672
Not even thank me.

541
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:20,452
Wow.

542
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,692
You paid for him.

543
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:24,452
Like a rich people.

544
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:29,092
When he's much richer like a billionaire.

545
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:31,112
I just lent him.

546
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:33,992
It's not hard to find him when he's in the same major.

547
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:36,032
Okay.

548
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:37,712
Always kind to everyone.

549
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,752
Including you.

550
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,452
Even it's your assignment, I had to hurry and help you

551
00:40:43,452 --> 00:40:44,332
Because of you.

552
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:48,572
If I ever find juicy apples,

553
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:50,172
I'll buy you some.

554
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:55,932
Sorry.

555
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:58,212
It's okay.

556
00:40:58,412 --> 00:40:59,732
It's true.

557
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:03,852
Oh, won't you go practicing?

558
00:41:05,612 --> 00:41:06,092
Right.

559
00:41:06,872 --> 00:41:08,052
About that...

560
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,252
I forgot my guitar back there.

561
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:11,932
Because of you.

562
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:13,052
You keep rushing me.

563
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,972
I'm really in a hurry.

564
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,252
The building must be close by now.

565
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,212
Why not tomorrow?

566
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,012
I can't.

567
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:21,232
It's my dear son.

568
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:23,372
I want to practice tonight.

569
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,672
I'll ask the prof. for an audition tomorrow.

570
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:28,252
- I'll go get it
- Want me to go with you?

571
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:30,232
No need. Just finish your work.

572
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:31,672
Okay.

573
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:32,872
Bye for now.

574
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:34,152
- See you later.
- See you later.

575
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:39,492
After talking to you,

576
00:41:39,852 --> 00:41:41,272
I got it now.

577
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,032
It's as Kim said.

578
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:45,932
What did he say?

579
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:47,612
He said...

580
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:50,432
I'll forget everything about him.

581
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:53,332
Really?

582
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:56,612
I don't think so.

583
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,132
If you don't remember him.

584
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,352
How could you know how he's different from me.

585
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:07,532
I must excuse myself.

586
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:08,672
Thank you.

587
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:09,932
Thank you.

588
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:18,492
Hey.

589
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:21,552
Ready to debut?

590
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:22,972
You and your brother.

591
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:25,072
That's exaggerating.

592
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:27,272
Just kidding.

593
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,512
Go home with me?

594
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:34,932
It's fine.

595
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:38,372
I'm allergic to Bentley.

596
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:40,832
Bye. See you later.

597
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,232
See you later, Payoo.

598
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:50,972
This way, young master.

599
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,052
How many times have I told you?

600
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:56,212
Don't call me young master.

601
00:42:58,612 --> 00:42:59,072
Sorry.

602
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:03,232
I'll get changed first.

603
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,672
Yes, Mr. Rain.

604
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:12,232
Meeting that zombie twice today.

605
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:14,192
I kinda sympathize him.

606
00:44:15,832 --> 00:44:18,452
But he's so irritating.

607
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,649
Happy Birthday.

608
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:10,919
Thank you for today.

609
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,819
No matter how this happened

610
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,599
By something or someone.

611
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,559
For this illuminating light,

612
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:32,499
Thank you.

613
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:51,579
Mister...

614
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:53,839
Do you have a key for music room?

615
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:55,179
Sorry.

616
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,359
The housekeepers just left a while ago.

617
00:47:58,819 --> 00:47:59,659
Anything's wrong?

618
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:01,459
Well...

619
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:06,019
Never mind.

620
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:07,059
Just...

621
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:08,699
Forgot something.

622
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,479
Damn.

623
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,839
What a great birthday!

624
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,679
Is it this guitar?

625
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:21,799
Oh!

626
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,819
My dear son!

627
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,599
You're here!

628
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,119
A person left it here in case someone will come for it.

629
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,139
Thank you so much.

630
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,479
Thank you!

631
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,039
Thanks!

632
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:35,539
Phew.

633
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,679
Mister! There's another...

634
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:50,099
Aw, he's gone.

635
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:56,259
The couple comets return to each other every 70 years.

636
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:00,819
It's believed that we can make a wish from these comets.

637
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,759
70 years...

638
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:43,559
To meet only once?

639
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:46,299
Must've missed each other.

640
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,599
If I can make a wish,

641
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,159
Then I will... Ouch!

642
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,839
Meeting that zombie twice today.

643
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:10,579
Still haunting me even now.

644
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,899
I kinda sympathize him.

645
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,499
But...

646
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,619
He's so irritating.

647
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:45,299
Even if you have no chlorophyll,

648
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,239
You still have me.

649
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,139
Then ask a friend over.

650
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:13,419
I have none.

651
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,279
To live in this world...

652
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:16,819
You need social life.

653
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:17,999
I'm fine being alone.

654
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:21,219
Music won't get your far.

655
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:25,439
It's my business that will take you anywhere you want.

656
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,379
What's wrong with music?

657
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:31,479
I want a chance to join the band.

658
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:33,219
Opportunity and ability

659
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:35,919
Always come together.

660
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,739
And not everyone gets that opportunity.

661
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:48,109
Hey.

662
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:48,769
Kim.

663
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:50,169
Still here?

664
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:53,589
Well... Baibua wants me to leave this with you.

665
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:55,409
Why didn't you call me?

666
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,009
I'm about to leave.

667
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,469
You're lucky I'm still here.

668
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,009
My batter's dead.

669
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:00,969
Oh.

670
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,089
Then, leave it inside.

671
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:05,389
Also...

672
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,029
Does one of your friends forget a guitar?

673
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,229
Take a look before housekeeper locks the door.

674
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:11,729
Okay.

675
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:14,469
And from now on,

676
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,729
You have to practice here more often.

677
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:20,689
You can't always do as your please anymore.

678
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:23,129
I understand.

679
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,249
I'll leave now.

680
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:27,049
Okay, good-bye.

681
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:35,949
I'll leave it here; in case someone comes for it.

682
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:37,989
The owner is

683
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:40,029
This tall.

684
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,469
About my shoulder's height.

685
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:47,129
And if he's here,

686
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:51,389
Please tell him to leave his bank account number in this note.

687
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:52,809
Sure.

688
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:54,349
I'll come for it later.

689
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,049
- Okay
- Thank you.
