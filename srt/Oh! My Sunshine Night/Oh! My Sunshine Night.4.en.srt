1
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,160
Hey.

2
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,860
Eat them all.

3
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,000
I cleaned them for you.

4
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
When you're good, it's great.

5
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,300
But when you're bad, you're awful.

6
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,380
Stop it!

7
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,240
If you don't,

8
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,480
my world will no longer have you.

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
I'll force myself into your world.

10
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,220
You'll never forget about me.

11
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
In your dreams!

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,260
You messed with the wrong guy.

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
A guy like me

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
never backs down.

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,400
That's great.

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Petch, that's good.

17
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,960
Why you only take his side?

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,840
None of your business.

19
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,200
Great.

20
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,860
Hey!

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Hey.

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,840
Get off.

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
You almost kissed.

24
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
Shut up.

25
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,840
Or they'll thrust you.

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,440
I don't care if they're gay.

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,440
Just medal.

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,980
and trophy.

29
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,360
Really?

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,720
Okay.

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
That's it for today.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Too much training could lead to injury before the competition.

33
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,640
Get up.

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,740
You always force us to join the competition.

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
Why don't you too?

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,160
He's afraid of losing.

37
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:25,920
Yeah.

38
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,080
But if it's you two,

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
it's a sure win.

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm comfident.

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,220
Both your swords are in sync.

42
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,240
And other swords?

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,440
Hey!

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,280
- Don't say that.
- You vulgar.

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,660
Don't say stupid sh*t again.

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,480
I hate it.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,960
Hey.

48
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,480
Get away from me.

49
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,140
Or there'll be weird rumor again.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,500
Why do you care?

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,260
It's just rumor?

52
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,720
I want to be popular.

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
You need popularity,

54
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,460
by causing a scene?

55
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,300
Do you want me to take a bath for you?

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,920
If you dare,

57
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,180
then do it.

58
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,240
Really?

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,620
No.

60
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,620
Why asked then?

61
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,580
Because I know

62
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,580
that you won't dare.

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,140
Actually,

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,740
you hate me.

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
You can fool anyone

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,300
except for me.

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,620
You

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,420
hate me.

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,700
Whatever you think.

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,720
Rain!

71
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm Sun.

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,340
Your code-brother.

73
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,140
Well...

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,940
We have a code-family party tonight.

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
So I want to

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,720
invite you there.

77
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,920
Oh!

78
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,160
My code-brother.

79
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't believe

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,420
that I'm a code-uncle now.

81
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm glad

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,120
to be your code-brother.

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm so lucky.

84
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,700
Even though I transferred here,

85
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,820
I get to be a code-brother

86
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,660
of this university's idol.

87
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,120
So cool!

88
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
I'm in 4th year already,

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,140
and you just appeared.

90
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,380
Isn't that too long for our first meeting?

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,160
Well...

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,680
I...

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,880
just transferred here a while ago.

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,220
So the ID code is a bit off.

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,380
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,780
It's okay.

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,520
Why so gloomy?

99
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,580
Oh,

100
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,040
you

101
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,920
are both handsome and kind.

102
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,620
Like everyone said.

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,740
I'm bored

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,060
of compliments.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,100
I want you to insult me.

106
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,760
What?

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Insult me

108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,400
harshly.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Uh...

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,460
You should do as your code-brother says.

111
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,640
But...

112
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,440
Insult me.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,060
You're ugly.

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
Pathetic.

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
Such a hideous person.

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay?

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,360
Not enough.

118
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,120
Be serious.

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,880
F**k!

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,660
Sh*t!

121
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,760
Control freak!

122
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,220
You're so arrogant!

123
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Think you're so cool?

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,640
Tch!

125
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,120
You motherf**ker.

126
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,580
Want me to insult you?

127
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,780
F**k you!

128
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,780
I love you.

129
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,060
My code-brother is so cool.

130
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
How's that?

131
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,340
I think

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,080
it's better.

133
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,680
You think

134
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,120
I'll pass

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,620
an exam tomorrow?

136
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,740
No way you won't.

137
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,240
You're great.

138
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Wow.

139
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,860
I'm blushing now.

140
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,620
My friend's good.

141
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,520
Hey.

143
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,500
Hey, you.

144
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,380
Watch me too.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,440
I...

146
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,260
have to go.

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,420
Er...

148
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,000
I bought a plant.

149
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,060
It's in my car.

150
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,240
Have to plant it.

151
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
You bigfoot!

152
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,020
Need my help?

153
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,480
No, thanks.

154
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,600
You seem to be considerate.

155
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,400
I like to take care of others.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,020
I found someone to cure your boredom.

157
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,120
If you bring him to me,

158
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,480
I'll punch him.

159
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,529
Hey.

160
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,609
Which plant do you think is Rain's favourite?

161
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,869
So I could pick one for him.

162
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:35,849
Rain is...

163
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,469
so handsome

164
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,069
and hunky.

165
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,309
Damn.

166
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,569
I think

167
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,789
I will be his flower myself.

168
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,189
Hey!

169
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,129
Over my dead body.

170
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,589
That's handsome vampire.

171
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:55,389
Wow.

172
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,429
That's why

173
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,749
suddenly it's chilled.

174
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:00,849
I want to be blood-sucked.

175
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,729
Hey.

176
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,009
Should we ask him to join us?

177
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,729
How?

178
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,169
Lasso him?

179
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,749
With your beauty.

180
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,889
Awww you.

181
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:20,629
Hey.

182
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,949
Can I ask what this plant is?

183
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,529
It must be flowering plant,

184
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,289
right?

185
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:37,749
Hey.

186
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,109
We should go.

187
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,369
He's my to be brother-in-law.

188
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,569
We should get along.

189
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,209
I warned you.

190
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,509
Take your time.

191
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:56,589
We have many species from around the world.

192
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,169
Look all you want.

193
00:11:58,729 --> 00:11:59,549
Okay.

194
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:07,409
What?

195
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:09,649
Oh.

196
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,669
He wants to see the plants.

197
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:13,609
I see.

198
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,109
Is this

199
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,549
the plant you brought?

200
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,549
Yeah.

201
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,429
I don't know if

202
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,089
it can be grown here.

203
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,349
What is it?

204
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:31,949
Is that...

205
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,009
Yeah.

206
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:34,629
Apple tree.

207
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,969
Find a place to plant it then.

208
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:51,529
Okay.

209
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,589
I'm looking.

210
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:55,049
Sure.

211
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,449
You could find it here.

212
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,749
Welcome to

213
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:16,389
code 169 family.

214
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,849
Welcome.

215
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:21,169
Thank you everyone.

216
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,669
Welcome to this university.

217
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:24,929
Study hard.

218
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,249
- Euro.
- Yes?

219
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,369
If you have any class materials, give her.

220
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,089
Sure, I've prepared them.

221
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,529
It's in our code-locker.

222
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,989
Thank you all.

223
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,409
Sun's in third year now.

224
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:39,949
Soon to be a fourth year.

225
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,609
You need to grow up.

226
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,169
The third year is

227
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,309
the most confusing time here

228
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,009
because you're not that old and not so young.

229
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:52,329
Have you

230
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,669
found anything confusing or interesting yet?

231
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,289
Yeah.

232
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:02,589
Wow.

233
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,049
So fast.

234
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,269
Wait.

235
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,909
That "anything" you said

236
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,429
is a situation or a person?

237
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,369
Er...

238
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:14,309
Who?

239
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,449
Who?

240
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,629
- Tell me.
- It might not be a person.

241
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,089
Yeah.

242
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,709
You can't think of anything else.

243
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,109
I only think of studying!

244
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:24,789
Right?

245
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:26,509
Right?

246
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,489
You seem to be considerate.

247
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,049
Yeah.

248
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,229
I like it.

249
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,709
I like to take care of others.

250
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,489
That means I choose the right guy.

251
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:42,149
What?

252
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,469
Choose?

253
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,429
For what?

254
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,229
Wait.

255
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,309
For your team?

256
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,929
I don't think so.

257
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:50,549
Yeah.

258
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:51,509
What?

259
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:53,449
I'm about to graduate.

260
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,469
Please take care of my brother.

261
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:56,909
I'll introduce him.

262
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,989
You know Kim?

263
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:07,609
Oh.

264
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:11,749
That zombie?

265
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,309
Take care of him for me.

266
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,529
He doesn't have many friends.

267
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,029
But I believe that you

268
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,749
are calm enough

269
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:27,829
to be his friend.

270
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,509
I believe in you.

271
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,169
I beg you.

272
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,749
I'll try.

273
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:48,989
I'm ready now.

274
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,769
Let's drink.

275
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:50,869
Drink!

276
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,249
Now have a toast.

277
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,129
Have a toast.

278
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:53,869
Come.

279
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,369
For my code-brother.

280
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,669
Cheers.

281
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,929
I...

282
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,109
don't drink.

283
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,209
Eh?

284
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:07,249
You despite us?

285
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:07,789
No!

286
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,249
Not like that.

287
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:10,109
I...

288
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,649
really don't drink.

289
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:13,269
Give me a glass.

290
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,689
A soda?

291
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,069
Get it away.

292
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,169
There you go.

293
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,349
Here.

294
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,689
Let's drink on the rock.

295
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,469
On the rock, okay?

296
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:23,209
Er...

297
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,269
Bottoms up.

298
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,769
It's our treat,

299
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,529
so you have to fill your belly.

300
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,989
Can't go home if you're not drunk.

301
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,469
Drink!

302
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,029
You need to help me.

303
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,849
I have to send my friend home.

304
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,749
But I don't know where he lives.

305
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,989
Only you know where.

306
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:55,769
Please help me.

307
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,569
I'll send his location to you.

308
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,609
Young master.

309
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,129
Uh...

310
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:15,209
Mr. Rain.

311
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,089
I thought you're at the camp.

312
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,609
Yeah, I forgot stuffs, so I come for them.

313
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:24,689
Actually,

314
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,089
you could tell me to bring them to you.

315
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,489
You think I can't take a taxi?

316
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,149
It's my duty.

317
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,469
Stop saying that.

318
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,809
Did you forget?

319
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,229
You need to take care of this

320
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,469
before others.

321
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:01,169
I miss...

322
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,109
I miss home.

323
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,229
Actually,

324
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,589
I can't sleep anywhere else.

325
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,769
Leaving the camp

326
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,249
is against the rule.

327
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,269
Sometimes

328
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,409
I want to break the rules.

329
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,409
You might not like it,

330
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,009
but I want to try.

331
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:41,709
That’s all.

332
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:09,769
Oh.

333
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:10,429
Rain.

334
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:12,089
Just as I thought.

335
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,109
You'll have to come back home by tonight.

336
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,489
Is there anything you don't know about me?

337
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:20,909
Um..

338
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,269
Nothing.

339
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,049
Sounds so confident.

340
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,709
How's

341
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,469
your code-nephew?

342
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:34,129
Good.

343
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,229
Friendly.

344
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:37,789
Just like me.

345
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:44,529
Rain.

346
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,029
I smell alcohol.

347
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,849
- You snuck out...
- Don't worry.

348
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,049
Just a little for my boredom.

349
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:55,729
Hey.

350
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,969
I found someone to cure your boredom.

351
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:06,509
Who?

352
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:07,389
Hey.

353
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,009
Don't bring anyone to me.

354
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:11,469
I can live like this.

355
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:13,669
I hate being bothered.

356
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,329
You'll be fine.

357
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:20,549
Are you in a hurry?

358
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,689
Don't change the subject.

359
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,289
If you bring him to me,

360
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:26,609
I'll punch him.

361
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,389
You won't.

362
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,509
If you see his bright eyes

363
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,429
and his optimism,

364
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,009
I'm sure

365
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,229
you won't be able to punch him.

366
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:43,269
Who's that?

367
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:45,809
You'll know.

368
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,189
Go.

369
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:49,409
Time to go now.

370
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:50,529
Hey.

371
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,229
Tell me first!

372
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,709
- Rain!
- Go.

373
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,029
Who?

374
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,769
Bright eyes?

375
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,789
Hey! Watch it!

376
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:28,929
Get up.

377
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:35,469
You smelly.

378
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:57,909
Why me?

379
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:02,469
Cheers!

380
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,949
- Not now.
- Cheers!

381
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,849
- Party's already over.
- Cheers.

382
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:14,349
Where are you taking me?

383
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,569
What are you doing to me?

384
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,449
Let me go.

385
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,029
Look, it's your condo.

386
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:20,029
See?

387
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:20,569
Hello.

388
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:22,509
How can I help?

389
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:23,909
It's okay.

390
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,069
He's just drunk.

391
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:26,989
I'll help.

392
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:27,589
Thanks.

393
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:29,249
He's helping.

394
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:31,009
Hey!

395
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:33,489
You called the police?

396
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,409
You're a mean zombie!

397
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:39,289
You bring me to police station?

398
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,249
Let me go! I didn't do anything wrong!

399
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:44,169
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,489
- Don't arrest me.
- Go.

401
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,149
- Take it slow.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

402
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:54,089
Let me go.

403
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:54,909
Which floor?

404
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,129
He lives on 25th floor.

405
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:59,029
Room number 2510.

406
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,329
Thank you.

407
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:02,349
Hey.

408
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,109
Give me your card.

409
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,729
Why do you need my ID card?

410
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,609
Keycard for your room.

411
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:22,349
- Let me see
- What are you doing?!

412
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:23,669
Just your card.

413
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:25,609
Here.

414
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:34,949
Easy there.

415
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,249
Let me go.

416
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,309
- Thank you.
- I didn't do anything.

417
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,449
What the hell.

418
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,610
One more drink.

419
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,350
Sun.

420
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,370
Bottoms up!

421
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,370
No more.

422
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,230
Payoo (storm)

423
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,150
and rain together

424
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,250
will bring disaster.

425
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,170
Iguazu falls.

426
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,270
Hey.

427
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,430
You.

428
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,750
Mom.

429
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,170
Mommy.

430
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,810
I miss you.

431
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,170
Mom.

432
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,410
Mommy.

433
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,990
I miss you.

434
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,730
Mom.

435
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,090
Mommy.

436
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,670
I miss you.

437
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,350
Sun, are you okay?

438
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:44,022
Oh.

439
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,242
Where are you going?

440
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:48,502
I'll go by myself.

441
00:35:49,702 --> 00:35:50,262
Er...

442
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,242
I'll drive for you.

443
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:01,642
Rain's out since early morning.

444
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:02,982
No need to wait.

445
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,022
He had to be early for the camp.

446
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:09,242
Oh.

447
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:12,042
What a weirdo.

448
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:14,622
Just a few hours at home is fine.

449
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:16,622
Maybe didn't sleep at all.

450
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:19,062
He must be homesick.

451
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:28,662
Er...

452
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:30,742
Let me drive for you.

453
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:36,742
Okay.

454
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,682
Payoo, I'll go to the club.

455
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,222
I'll pick you up in the evening.

456
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:12,822
Okay.

457
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:47,002
Ahem.

458
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:50,182
What's in your throat?

459
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:52,842
Nothing.

460
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:55,602
I haven't forgot

461
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:56,902
about last night.

462
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,242
But I forgot.

463
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,322
Hey.

464
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,002
What happened

465
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:08,382
last night?

466
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:10,802
Why didn't you tell me?

467
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:14,342
Oh.

468
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,402
The weather's nice today.

469
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,002
Ohhh.

470
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,562
Why change the subject.

471
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:26,862
Alright.

472
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:28,462
Well.

473
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:30,882
It's been cultivated

474
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:33,822
in a controlled environment,

475
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,262
both weather and temperature.

476
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:39,742
Even though you don't take care of it,

477
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:41,282
it won't die.

478
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:42,602
Believe me.

479
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,262
Hey.

480
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:53,302
Why not buy the apples instead?

481
00:38:58,242 --> 00:38:59,802
If I have a tree,

482
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,482
I'll be assured that

483
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,162
I'll always have it.

484
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:06,022
Hello?

485
00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:07,742
This is apple.

486
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:09,722
Every convenient store has it.

487
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:12,902
Don't mind me.

488
00:39:14,462 --> 00:39:15,482
I'm going to class now.

489
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:16,822
How about you?

490
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:19,982
30 minutes till class time.

491
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:23,802
Fine.

492
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,202
I'll go first.

493
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:28,882
Kim.

494
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:32,302
I'm going.

495
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:34,762
It might survive,

496
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:39,222
but it might not bear fruits

497
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:43,222
because it's not where it belongs.

498
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,002
It's okay.

499
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:55,802
At least I tried.

500
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:30,482
Are you in a wrong place?

501
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,062
No.

502
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:33,782
Because I'm here for you.

503
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:35,822
I never knew

504
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:38,322
you like music.

505
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:39,582
Er...

506
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:41,802
This evening,

507
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,982
I want to take you to the cafe.

508
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:46,482
For what?

509
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,302
You want me to be a fencer

510
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:52,322
or what?

511
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,002
For you to know

512
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,262
that your decision is not wrong.

513
00:40:58,102 --> 00:40:58,662
Okay.

514
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:00,942
I'll go with you.

515
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:02,362
Then,

516
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:03,522
see you.

517
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,502
Hey, you sneaky.

518
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:31,962
Sneaky?

519
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,102
I'm not sneaky.

520
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:35,362
No.

521
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:38,762
It's just a greeting like wassup, man. You know?

522
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:45,442
Everyone,

523
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:48,322
Go warm up by running in the field for 5 laps.

524
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,022
5 times?

525
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,282
We'll be exhausted by then.

526
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:55,322
The sun's scorching. We'd be dead.

527
00:41:56,282 --> 00:41:58,142
Or you want 100 laps in the gym?

528
00:41:58,782 --> 00:41:59,482
Up to you.

529
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,222
5 laps then.

530
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:04,922
Let's go.

531
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:19,202
We say fight!

532
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:19,722
Fight!

533
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:21,482
Speed up.

534
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,022
We say win!

535
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:23,962
Win!

536
00:42:24,382 --> 00:42:24,882
Nice.

537
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,002
Young master.

538
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:48,762
Young master.

539
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,202
Mr. Rain.

540
00:42:57,802 --> 00:42:58,302
Mr. Rain.

541
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:01,482
Mr. Rain.

542
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:03,102
I'm fine now.

543
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:08,242
Ouch.

544
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:10,862
Payoo.

545
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,282
What's wrong?

546
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:20,002
You need doctor.

547
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:21,022
Payoo!

548
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:22,542
You're injured.

549
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:24,082
I'm fine, captain.

550
00:43:25,222 --> 00:43:26,222
Go! It's an order.

551
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:32,542
You're alright?

552
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:43,582
Sun.

553
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:44,082
What?

554
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,762
I have to go the field.

555
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:47,602
The team's been practicing.

556
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:51,782
You're overly eager.

557
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:53,282
What happened?

558
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,262
Yeah.

559
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:00,782
I'm easy to read.

560
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:03,982
Okay.

561
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:06,882
See you later then.

562
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:07,742
Okay.

563
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:13,982
Sun.

564
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:15,122
What's wrong?

565
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:17,682
Nothing.

566
00:44:19,062 --> 00:44:20,202
Just stomach ache

567
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:22,482
from last night's drink.

568
00:44:25,442 --> 00:44:26,482
You never drink.

569
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:28,402
You shouldn't drink that much.

570
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:31,482
I know.

571
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:32,802
Just go.

572
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:35,342
Bye.

573
00:44:57,642 --> 00:44:58,182
Baibua.

574
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,622
Wait for me at the canteen.

575
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:01,782
Meet you there.

576
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,262
Sure.

577
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:04,002
Okay.

578
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:30,522
Instead of going home,

579
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:32,062
you come here?

580
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:42,402
The couple comets are really returning?

581
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,362
Why does it seem to

582
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:46,682
get further away?

583
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:48,582
Keeping it inside

584
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,582
will only frustrates you.

585
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,742
If you have feelings for someone,

586
00:45:53,122 --> 00:45:54,142
go for it.

587
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,942
I want to take you to the cafe.

588
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:55,982
What if I don't?

589
00:47:56,442 --> 00:47:57,962
Then you're making mistake.

590
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:08,802
Okay.

591
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:10,902
I'll go with you.

592
00:48:12,502 --> 00:48:13,082
You're sure?

593
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:14,522
Then,

594
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:15,702
See you.

595
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:24,382
Sun.

596
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,082
Why the long face?

597
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:27,962
Nothing.

598
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:30,442
Then, let's go.

599
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:31,982
Professor's coming.

600
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:35,062
Let's go.
