1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,440
I'm scared to die.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,820
When it's really happening,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,040
I'm frightened.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,920
I'm right here.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,020
I won't let anything happen to you.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,860
I promise.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,180
Without duty,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,820
who am I in your eyes?

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,120
When I remember,

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,720
I'll never forget.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,420
Do you want to forget about me

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,280
or remember?

13
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,900
Thank you so much

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,980
for making my memories here

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,740
in this university the most beautiful.

16
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Thank you too.

17
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh! Sun.

18
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,600
Hey.

19
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,640
Pie.

20
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,440
How are you?

21
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,620
You're alright?

22
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,220
Yeah.

23
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,100
Thanks.

24
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,840
Oh! Kim.

25
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,800
Didn't expect to see you here.

26
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,900
Such a coincidence.

27
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
I don't think so.

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,720
Seems like it's intended.

29
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,380
Hurry up.

30
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,860
Or I won't drive you home.

31
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,920
Come!

32
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,620
Hey. Come on.

33
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,980
Hurry up.

34
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,820
Oh.

35
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,820
I have to go now.

36
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,120
See you.

37
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,900
Here, hold it.

38
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey!

39
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,320
Why so furious?

40
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,940
You drove so fast.

41
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,880
Not at all.

42
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm...

43
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm pretty calm.

44
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,200
So I drove fast.

45
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,560
What?

46
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,400
If I'm more calm,

47
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,700
I'll drive faster.

48
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,580
If I'm with you,

49
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,980
please be more furious next time.

50
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,200
So you'll drive slower.

51
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,920
Well... the traffic is good.

52
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,360
So I want to test my engine.

53
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,460
It's dangerous!

54
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,740
If you want to do that,

55
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,560
do it without me.

56
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
I almost pissed myself.

57
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,140
Where?

58
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,500
I can't see your piss.

59
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,000
It's just a metaphor!

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
I know.

61
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,860
Just joking.

62
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,660
Thank you.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,500
No problem.

64
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,160
Need help?

65
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,460
It's okay.

66
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,760
Thank you.

67
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,680
Sun!

68
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,880
Sun!

69
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,140
Sun!

70
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,440
Sun!

71
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,620
Sun!

72
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,820
Sun!

73
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,380
Oh! Kim.

74
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
The elevator isn't working?

75
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,260
Your room's on 25th floor.

76
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,380
Uh...

77
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,760
And...

78
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,620
How are you here?

79
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,360
I ran.

80
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,420
You're sweating.

81
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,920
And...

82
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,920
Why did you

83
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,100
run?

84
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,400
Oh!

85
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,220
I totally forgot!

86
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,580
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,720
Wait, Kim!

88
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,940
What?

89
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,860
Do you...

90
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
want to take a rest at my room?

91
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,160
We can make a wish upon those comets.

92
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,020
What do you wish for?

93
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:26,032
Make yourself at home.

94
00:11:58,572 --> 00:11:59,412
Will it bear fruit

95
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,132
before you eat those all?

96
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:05,712
Are you joking?

97
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,912
It'll take like

98
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,572
ten years to bear fruit.

99
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:13,992
But it's okay.

100
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,852
I can wait.

101
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:18,772
I'll wait until it bears fruits.

102
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:23,452
But you must promise me that you'll take good care of it

103
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:27,272
Sure.

104
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:28,692
I will.

105
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:40,812
Hey.

106
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:43,572
Can I ask you something?

107
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:50,932
Does it really help you?

108
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:54,752
Yeah.

109
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:57,812
So...

110
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,012
What happened to you?

111
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,092
That's why you...

112
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:05,592
Have to eat it?

113
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:08,172
Yeah.

114
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:10,832
Well...

115
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,032
I was born with a heart condition.

116
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,812
Two veins send blood to my heart.

117
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,092
Almost didn't survive.

118
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,652
That's why

119
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,152
I can't live with my parents.

120
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:32,832
Actually, I have two brothers.

121
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,472
But...

122
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,912
They both died when they're one month old

123
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,152
with the same condition.

124
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:43,272
Heart condition...

125
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:45,432
Yeah.

126
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,052
My parents believe that

127
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:50,852
it's superstitious

128
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,372
rather than scientific.

129
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:56,492
That's why they must stay far away from me

130
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,372
in order for me to survive.

131
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,652
It may be true.

132
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,032
Because right now,

133
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,292
I'm still breathing.

134
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,392
With the price of being alone.

135
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:23,572
I'm sorry for asking.

136
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:24,952
No.

137
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:26,532
It's okay.

138
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:28,772
I should thank you

139
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,272
that I got to say it.

140
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:32,472
And...

141
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,232
For bringing me back that night.

142
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,152
Is that...

143
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:55,752
That?

144
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,892
It represents the wait.

145
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:01,752
The wait?

146
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,812
The wait for the couple comets

147
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,012
that return to each other every 70 years.

148
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,612
It's believed that

149
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,652
we can make a wish upon those comets.

150
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,512
When is the return?

151
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:43,932
Next February.

152
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,252
In four months...

153
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:58,572
What would you wish for?

154
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:12,012
A cellist representative to join the competition...

155
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:14,712
I already made it.

156
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,372
How about you?

157
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:24,652
Umm...

158
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:29,232
If I told you, it wouldn't be a wish.

159
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,292
Right?

160
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:37,952
I'm surprised.

161
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,372
We now live in a digital era.

162
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,712
And you still believe it?

163
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:00,272
It's gonna be hectic without you, Payoo.

164
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,752
No employees stay so long.

165
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:04,932
Some are so lazy.

166
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,112
Some are useless.

167
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:07,012
Damn.

168
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,212
So annoying.

169
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:10,772
Right.

170
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:12,172
Well...

171
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,192
I graduated.

172
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,832
So I want to pursue the career I want,

173
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:18,852
and take care of myself and dad.

174
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,412
I get it.

175
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,072
I'm just complaining.

176
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:25,832
By the way,

177
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,292
are you moving out soon?

178
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:32,592
I think...

179
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,712
It's time to move out.

180
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,292
Oh.

181
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:38,252
Right.

182
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,602
Time will tell what to do

183
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:42,932
and what not.

184
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:49,992
Yeah.

185
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:54,532
Okay.

186
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,162
Hurry up.

187
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,192
I'll throw you a party tonight.

188
00:17:58,722 --> 00:17:59,222
Okay?

189
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:00,822
Oh.

190
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:01,872
Okay.

191
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:19,342
The restaurant's close.

192
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:22,592
Baibua.

193
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,412
Baibua,

194
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:01,762
what's wrong?

195
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:03,152
Why are you here?

196
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,132
Nothing.

197
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:11,682
I just want to tell you.

198
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:15,042
I've thought

199
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,572
about what to say.

200
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:21,922
Yeah?

201
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:22,972
But I'd better not.

202
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:31,852
Actually,

203
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,652
I've prepared a lot of stuffs to say.

204
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,542
But when it's time,

205
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:45,582
I can't say it.

206
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,772
- Baibua, I...
- Let's just say...

207
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,322
Let's say there's nothing happened.

208
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:14,292
So we don't owe each other anything.

209
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:28,012
Baibua...

210
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,142
I'll leave now.

211
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:36,452
Then...

212
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:37,972
When you're home...

213
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:39,182
Today,

214
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,442
I won't text you.

215
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:50,002
So you won't have to worry.

216
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,732
Don't send me off

217
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,242
if you don't want to see my tears

218
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,972
You're leaving us?

219
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:32,435
Oh.

220
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,115
Thank you.

221
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:39,115
Sadly, it's too dark to see anything now.

222
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,275
I want to know if the scenery in the morning

223
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,465
will worth our plane flight,

224
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,845
helicopter flight, and then van transport.

225
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,225
If it's not worth it,

226
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,545
do you think I'd waste my time coming here?

227
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:57,275
I believe in your judgment.

228
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:00,735
Are you tired?

229
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:01,855
Not at all.

230
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:06,065
Youth is the time explore one's self.

231
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,165
Keep exploring the world, you'll learn more.

232
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:10,415
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,635
Let's go.

234
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,225
Hello, Mr. Kacha.

235
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:19,425
Hello, madam.

236
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,205
- Hello.
- Hello.

237
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:21,695
Oh.

238
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,375
This is Dr. Sookwan.

239
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,025
My major shareholder.

240
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:26,035
Hello.

241
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,355
And that's Rain,

242
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,595
my eldest son.

243
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:30,675
This is Somkid,

244
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,895
Caretaker of this Chateau.

245
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,535
Chateau villa welcomes you all.

246
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,275
I must inform you that

247
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,655
during your stay here,

248
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,175
there may be some inconvenience.

249
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,315
Because we recently changed our staffs.

250
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,755
Every housekeeper and drivers.

251
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,995
Our previous staffs' contracts are expired

252
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,265
after the passing of Mr. David, the late owner.

253
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:52,355
So if there's any inconvenience,

254
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:54,715
- I have to...
- It's okay.

255
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:57,195
You must be tired.

256
00:24:57,635 --> 00:24:58,795
Please rest inside.

257
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:00,305
This way.

258
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:08,235
This way.

259
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:13,555
Wow.

260
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:18,235
This is even better than in the picture you sent me.

261
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:20,145
Welcome.

262
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,985
Looks cozy like home.

263
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,195
I really like it.

264
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:34,435
No.

265
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,515
It's home.

266
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:37,015
Oh.

267
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:39,795
I'll show you around in the morning.

268
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,625
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

269
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,175
This is Mon Fah tea.

270
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,205
We grow it here.

271
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,995
I'm sure you'll like it.

272
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:04,045
It must be nice to have a sip of wine in this great atmosphere.

273
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:05,015
Er...

274
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,515
We don't have wine here.

275
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,955
I've been here before Mr. Kacha's friend.

276
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:11,025
I mean Mr. David, the later owner.

277
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:13,055
About one year before he passed away.

278
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:15,435
But I've never seen him drink.

279
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:17,965
He never prepared it for guests too.

280
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:20,145
Maybe because

281
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:22,715
he has health problems.

282
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:23,805
It's okay.

283
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,895
The atmosphere is more important than any wine.

284
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:29,885
You never make me disappointed.

285
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:32,595
I'm glad you like it.

286
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,135
Rain.

287
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,235
You need to take after your dad.

288
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:39,375
Have tricks up sleeves like him.

289
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:40,995
And I'd be at ease.

290
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:45,195
He'll do his best from now on.

291
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,025
I decide to put Rain in charge of this project.

292
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:51,315
And I'll be just an adviser.

293
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,245
Great.

294
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,915
As your shareholder,

295
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:59,375
I'll be glad to know that my investment

296
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,425
will worth every single penny.

297
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:04,385
You all talk about money again!

298
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,105
We can talk about that tomorrow.

299
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,045
You always stop me.

300
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:11,035
You have to.

301
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:50,735
I want a happier life.

302
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,625
I'm happy with this life.

303
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,965
A life where you're not sure about going left or right.

304
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:58,195
Not knowing where to go?

305
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:04,715
Hey, Payoo.

306
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:10,815
You look red.

307
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:12,575
What happened?

308
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:16,395
Well...

309
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,115
My workplace gave me a farewell party.

310
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:21,295
Farewell?

311
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:22,805
You...

312
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,945
You quit the job?

313
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:28,065
Yeah.

314
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:31,405
Payoo.

315
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:34,445
You graduated.

316
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:37,215
Why won't you work with my father?

317
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:43,155
I...

318
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,275
I don't want to bother him.

319
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:52,475
That means...

320
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,085
You're leaving us?

321
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,515
I must excuse myself now.

322
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:11,905
Payoo.

323
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:15,395
Does Rain know?

324
00:29:27,135 --> 00:29:28,495
If Master Rain's back,

325
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:30,595
I'll tell him.

326
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:35,985
Why'd you do this?

327
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:47,155
I...

328
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:50,195
I just do what I should do.

329
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:51,935
That's it.

330
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:55,245
What you should do

331
00:29:56,715 --> 00:29:58,205
is to stay.

332
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:09,485
Well...

333
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:11,195
I must excuse myself.

334
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:42,755
Payoo.

335
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,105
Can I come in?

336
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:47,335
Er...

337
00:30:47,855 --> 00:30:48,605
Yeah.

338
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:19,965
You didn't just come here to fold my clothes, right?

339
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:26,555
I've lived here since you're not born.

340
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,715
I owe our master so much.

341
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:40,925
But if you want to leave,

342
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:43,085
you should.

343
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:47,955
I'll stay to take care of our masters.

344
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:56,755
Dad.

345
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:58,635
Just take a bath and go to bed.

346
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,125
I'll go to bed too.

347
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,385
Dad, I...

348
00:32:57,755 --> 00:33:00,095
You must survive.

349
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:01,995
Be strong.

350
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:04,225
I'll take care of you.

351
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:15,755
Do you want to know

352
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,315
what would I wish for?

353
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:47,585
Mr. Kacha has a keen sense of real estate.

354
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:49,755
He's one in a million.

355
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:54,205
Hello, doctor.

356
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,795
If we turn this place into a business,

357
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:04,255
we'll gain huge profit.

358
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,655
I think dad would keep it.

359
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,695
For the value will be higher.

360
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,175
He's visionary.

361
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,615
You really look up to him.

362
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:29,275
He's great. Everybody admires him.

363
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:31,935
But can't be him.

364
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,295
How about you?

365
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:44,945
Do you want to be him?

366
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:50,365
I am me.

367
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,765
I can't be him.

368
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:55,745
But I think...

369
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,245
You're just like him.

370
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:08,625
You might not see it.

371
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,395
But I see it in you.

372
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,215
Young master?

373
00:36:58,705 --> 00:36:59,515
Young master?

374
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:04,735
May I come in?

375
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,465
Where would he go this early morning?

376
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:30,925
Master isn't here,

377
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,085
so he went out with his motorcycle.

378
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:35,455
Young master.

379
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,065
Have you eaten anything?

380
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:43,075
Not yet.

381
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:44,555
Then...

382
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,725
Let's buy something to cook at my room.

383
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,545
Okay?

384
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,172
Not good.

385
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,252
Oh, Kim!

386
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:21,682
What are you doing here?

387
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:24,842
Oh!

388
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:26,282
Such a coincidence.

389
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:27,592
Well...

390
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,442
I just visit my friend

391
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:30,502
around here.

392
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:32,392
But...

393
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:33,992
He's not home.

394
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,272
Oh.

395
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,712
You have friend?!

396
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,002
Hey, you.

397
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,442
Don't you have nice thing to say?

398
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:48,892
By the way,

399
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,442
where are you going?

400
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,852
To the nearby supermarket.

401
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:56,772
Oh! Nice.

402
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:58,692
I'm going there too.

403
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:01,172
You came this far

404
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,242
just for the supermarket?

405
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:05,802
Yeah!

406
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:07,092
I heard that

407
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,562
the selection is wide here.

408
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:10,642
So I came.

409
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:12,202
Really?

410
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:13,292
Yeah.

411
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,582
Uh...

412
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,072
Er...

413
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:21,112
Well...

414
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,372
I think

415
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:23,732
I should go now.

416
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:27,622
Kim!

417
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,142
I'll go now. Bye!

418
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:32,722
Kim!

419
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:37,162
Supermarket's that way.

420
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:41,862
Oh!

421
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,082
Really?

422
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,402
Totally forgot.

423
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:45,862
I've not been here often.

424
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:47,542
Go with me then.

425
00:40:53,832 --> 00:40:54,332
Oh.

426
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,182
Nice.

427
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:57,242
Let's go.

428
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:17,972
Where's master Kim?

429
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:20,222
Er...

430
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:22,372
He went out since early morning.

431
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,132
Why didn't you drive for him?

432
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:30,152
He said he'd go by himself.

433
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,152
I told you

434
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:33,912
to take good care of him.

435
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,532
He's not a kid anymore.

436
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:46,842
If he says no,

437
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:48,842
I must obey.

438
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,312
Isn't that right?

439
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:54,732
Great.

440
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,252
At least someone here

441
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,842
knows how to obey the order.

442
00:42:27,682 --> 00:42:28,612
Wow!

443
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:31,442
I didn't expect this.

444
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,412
It's so beautiful in the morning.

445
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:35,942
I told you so.

446
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:37,682
How is it?

447
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,182
You know how perceptive he is.

448
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:45,092
This Chateau Villa

449
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:46,422
is like a small town.

450
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:48,022
We have everything:

451
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,522
electricity,

452
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:50,932
water,

453
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:54,502
self-sown barley rice, vegetables, fruits,

454
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:55,912
livestock,

455
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:58,342
and we have a stable behind.

456
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:01,602
But we rarely go there.

457
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:03,192
A stable?

458
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,122
Yes.

459
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,182
If Kim,

460
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,072
my brother,

461
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,922
get to see this, he'd be thrilled.

462
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,672
He loves horse riding.

463
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:14,422
Great.

464
00:43:15,352 --> 00:43:17,192
Now please come this way.

465
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:19,062
I'll show you the barley rice field.

466
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:20,102
This way.

467
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:21,022
Okay.

468
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:53,912
What are you buying?

469
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:56,712
Ah...

470
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:57,832
I...

471
00:43:58,312 --> 00:43:59,412
will go that way.

472
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:02,262
I'll help.

473
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:06,162
Thanks.

474
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:08,562
And...

475
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:10,372
Have you eaten anything?

476
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:12,342
Ah...

477
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:13,462
Not yet.

478
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:14,662
Why?

479
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:16,692
Then...

480
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,202
Let's...

481
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,312
buy something to cook at my room.

482
00:44:23,462 --> 00:44:24,282
Well...

483
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:25,502
That's...

484
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:27,032
That's...

485
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:28,162
Okay.

486
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:29,542
It's still early.

487
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:31,102
Good.

488
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:33,512
What do you not eat?

489
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:37,762
Er...

490
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:39,512
Beef,

491
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,052
Chicken,

492
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,102
Egg yolk.

493
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:44,322
I'm allergic to seafood,

494
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,372
squid and shrimp.

495
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:48,072
For vegetables,

496
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:50,052
I don't eat cowpea,

497
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:51,652
cauliflowers, cucumbers.

498
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:53,242
I think they're stinky.

499
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:55,572
And mayonnaise.

500
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:56,662
Kimchi.

501
00:44:56,982 --> 00:44:58,422
- Wasabi
- Okay!

502
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,962
What do you eat?

503
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:02,132
That's easier.

504
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:05,222
Pork.

505
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:06,982
Spaghetti.

506
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:08,582
Macaroni.

507
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:09,912
Okay!

508
00:45:10,362 --> 00:45:11,142
That's enough.

509
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,112
Why do you ask then?

510
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:14,422
Er...

511
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,262
Oh! Kim.

512
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:18,202
Pie...

513
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:20,692
Coincidence?

514
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:23,302
Er... What?

515
00:45:24,212 --> 00:45:25,602
I'm sure you planned this

516
00:45:26,202 --> 00:45:26,952
'coincidence.'

517
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:30,542
Sun.

518
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:32,852
Aren't you going with Petch?

519
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:34,492
No.

520
00:45:35,242 --> 00:45:36,842
Petch told me

521
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:39,432
he wants to hang out with you.

522
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:41,912
It's nice.

523
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:43,222
So you'll get closer.

524
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,282
Why don't you call him now?

525
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,322
Today,

526
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:55,012
I'll buy something to cook at Sun's condo.

527
00:45:55,682 --> 00:45:56,282
Call him.

528
00:45:57,162 --> 00:45:57,682
Really?

529
00:45:58,232 --> 00:45:58,732
Yeah.

530
00:45:59,302 --> 00:46:01,302
Okay, I'll call him.

531
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:04,452
Hey, you!

532
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:06,722
You should ask me first.

533
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:08,232
It's fine.

534
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:10,562
So you don't have to hang out.

535
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,582
Stay home.

536
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:14,282
Or...

537
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:16,102
It's a bad idea?

538
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:18,822
Hey.

539
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:20,642
Petch is coming.

540
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:21,972
He lives nearby.

541
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:24,452
Coincidence?

542
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:26,742
Right.

543
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:32,052
What will you eat?

544
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,372
I only prepare for two portions.

545
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:46,982
I think I'll look for seafood over there.

546
00:46:47,602 --> 00:46:48,242
Is that okay?

547
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:49,512
What?

548
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:18,042
Poor Kim.

549
00:47:18,762 --> 00:47:19,892
You must love this.

550
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:23,672
Hey, you handsome.

551
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:40,872
Weird.

552
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,042
Barely nobody comes here.

553
00:47:46,002 --> 00:47:46,842
So dirty.

554
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:07,942
Somkid said no wine here.

555
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:13,382
Seems like there's only new recruits.

556
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:15,702
So no one knows.

557
00:49:46,232 --> 00:49:47,602
No signal here.

558
00:49:50,372 --> 00:49:51,332
I'll send them later.

559
00:50:21,592 --> 00:50:23,652
Here we come.

560
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:27,912
Oh, Kim.

561
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:29,722
Come and eat with us.

562
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:34,882
Come.

563
00:50:36,522 --> 00:50:37,402
I'll eat anyway.

564
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:38,822
I'm starving.

565
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:49,252
I didn't know you are good at cooking.

566
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,062
Actually, I live nearby.

567
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,652
Can I come here more often?

568
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,112
Kim! That's shrimp!

569
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:02,472
Yeah, shrimp.

570
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:04,902
You're allergic!

571
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:37,962
It's okay, Sun.

572
00:51:38,102 --> 00:51:39,082
Pie's there.

573
00:51:40,612 --> 00:51:41,542
I'll help.

574
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:44,882
I need to find a successor.

575
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:47,302
Big first job.

576
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:49,762
I'll need your guidance a lot more.

577
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:51,482
My pleasure.

578
00:51:52,722 --> 00:51:53,762
When you're sleeping,

579
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:57,732
my heart still beats fast.

580
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:10,122
Wow.

581
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:12,312
Such a big shrimp.

582
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:14,852
Umm...

583
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:16,722
They're making spaghetti.

584
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:18,782
Hey.

585
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:20,422
I want 1KG of shrimp.

586
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:21,802
And please

587
00:54:22,522 --> 00:54:24,182
peel and devein them.

588
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:25,542
Okay, wait a minute.

589
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:26,322
Okay.

590
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:35,422
There.
