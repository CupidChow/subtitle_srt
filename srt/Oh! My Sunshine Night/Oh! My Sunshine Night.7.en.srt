1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,000
Do you still

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,560
want to join our club?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,600
Wait!

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
You passed the audition for this band
with your own talent.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,800
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,760
For helping me audition.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,840
It's for the band.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,720
Not for you.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,720
Can't you say something nicer?

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,440
You stubborn.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,280
I told you to do whatever you want to do.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Payoo.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,680
You're here?

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,840
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm sorry I took a few days off.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,720
I was unwell.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,920
It's okay.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,760
Sick people should rest.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,160
By the way,

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,400
it's so crowded the day you're not here.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
Don't know why, though.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Hmm... Maybe it's the beginning of the month.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Right.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,320
Want to have some meals?

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,960
No, thanks. I'll eat later.

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,280
Wow.

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,360
As imposing as everyone said.

28
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,000
What did they say?

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
Elegant.

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,920
Classy.

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Something like that.

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Does being here with you

33
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,480
make you look more classy?

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
SNS feed will be crazy today.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
You care about that?

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,040
If I care,

37
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
I wouldn't be with you.

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,720
Right?

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,440
Tomorrow, do you

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,040
want me to pick you up?

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,680
I have a driver.

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,160
See you tomorrow then.

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,960
I'd rather not.

44
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,440
Thanks.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,720
Excuse me.

46
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,800
Thank you.

47
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,680
Enjoy your meal.

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Hey.

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,720
Baibua.

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Payoo.

51
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,120
What's wrong?

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,320
Oh.

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,240
Nothing.

54
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,480
I've come for a meal.

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,200
Oh! Have a seat.

56
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,120
Um...

57
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
What would you like?

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Hmm..

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Anything's fine.
Pick one for me.

60
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh.

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,400
Really?

62
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah.

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:31,920
Then,

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
How about tteokbokki?

65
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I'll give you extra chicken.

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Thank you.

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,800
Okay. Wait a moment.

68
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Hey. What's up?

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
She's my friend from university.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
I didn't say a word.

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,640
But...

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
If you don't like her,

73
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,000
can I go for it?

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,360
She's my type.

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Damn you.

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,560
What?

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,360
Ouch!

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Hot!

79
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,560
Your balls will be boiled from that hot water.

80
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,200
They're not eggs in a hot spring.

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Really?

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
Let me see.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,160
Here. Look.

84
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
- Look.
- Where?

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't see it.

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,560
Touch it.

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
You pervert!

88
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,200
Bastard.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Damn.

90
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,320
I thought you're bolder.

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Hey.

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Young master.

93
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
Why so quiet today?

94
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
Why so little?

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
I thought you're bolder.

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,040
Damn you!

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
Bastard!

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,040
Crap.

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,560
Even you too?

100
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
Crap!

101
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
What's wrong?

102
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
Is it that obvious?

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,280
Don't you see?

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,440
What do you see?

105
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,400
You might never look at yourself

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,120
because

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,960
you don't care about yourself.

108
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
But I see it.

109
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,560
You know why?

110
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,160
Because I care.

111
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
Good luck.

112
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,400
Thanks.

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,480
Text me when you get home.

114
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,280
What?

115
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,120
Oh!

116
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,840
Yeah.

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,040
Can't wait to be at home.

118
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,320
I shouldn't.

119
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
He'd definitely get annoyed.

120
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,520
He's so hard to please.

121
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,960
But

122
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Just one message

123
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
would be fine?

124
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,080
[What are you doing?]

125
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
No!

126
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
Stop thinking about this.

127
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
You'd better sleep.

128
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,640
Why do you care about him?

129
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
If you miss him,

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
go to see him.

131
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,360
What!

132
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,160
You haunt me even when I'm about to sleep?

133
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,320
You zombie!

134
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,360
Do your best.

135
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
Can't wait to hear it.

136
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,199
Excuse me.

137
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,839
Please change the grill.

138
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,799
- Sure.
- Refill charcoal too.

139
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,619
Geng.

140
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,319
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,479
Pour soju for me.

142
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,879
Alright.

143
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,679
Wait a moment.

144
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,639
You're alone today?

145
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,459
Yeah.

146
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,799
I can't open the bottle.

147
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,619
It's easy for me.

148
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,979
Bottoms up!

149
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:34,699
Is it sweet?

150
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,159
Very much.

151
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,699
Sweeter than me?

152
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,819
No way.

153
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,379
The truth is

154
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:45,859
I've never met anyone as cute as you when drinking soju.

155
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,619
You're so cute!

156
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,279
Mr. Rain!

157
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,939
Leave it for 15 minutes.

158
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,719
Remember,

159
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,999
don't put ice on it.

160
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,619
Or it could be infected.

161
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,339
Stay put.

162
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,819
It's okay.

163
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,579
I'm used to this.

164
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,499
But I'm not.

165
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:52,599
Can you get up?

166
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,339
Oh.

167
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,939
How did you get here?

168
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,139
It doesn't matter.

169
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:11,999
By the way,

170
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,279
are you okay?

171
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:16,999
I'm okay.

172
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:20,879
You denied

173
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,319
working at my place to work here.

174
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,639
Just allowing me to live there

175
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:33,899
is more than enough.

176
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,159
You're always like this

177
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:39,419
since you're young.

178
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,399
Since I was young,

179
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,579
my feelings

180
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,619
have always been the same.

181
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,259
Never changes.

182
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,639
It's good to be you.

183
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:03,719
You're free

184
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,839
to do anything.

185
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,399
Not everything.

186
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:17,799
Ah...

187
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,319
It's ignited.

188
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:22,179
I'll help.

189
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,239
Mr. Rain.

190
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,099
Get me a bowl.

191
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,499
The business's not doing well?
Why so little charcoal?

192
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:33,939
Actually,

193
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,279
there's a lot more upstairs.

194
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:10,759
Hey.

195
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,499
We meet again.

196
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,739
Hello.

197
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,379
Hi.

198
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,419
Is it heavy? I'll help.

199
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:21,779
Oh.

200
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:23,019
It's fine.

201
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,659
I want to help.

202
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:26,719
Come.

203
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:29,399
Thanks.

204
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,479
Hmm...

205
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,879
You rehearse every day?

206
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,099
Uh huh.

207
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,519
We need to perform for the rugby match closing ceremony.

208
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:40,639
Great.

209
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,679
I'll watch your performance.

210
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,119
Uh huh.

211
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,479
Come watch my fencing match too.

212
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,899
Uh huh. Sure.

213
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,619
Can you say more than 'Uh huh'?

214
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,559
Uh huh.

215
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:56,359
Oops!

216
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,479
Sure.

217
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:01,999
You're going to the club?

218
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:03,679
I'll walk with you.

219
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,419
Let's go.

220
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,299
Thank you.

221
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:19,619
Do you best.

222
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,839
Can't wait to hear it.

223
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,299
Everyone's ready?

224
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,879
We need to rehearse more

225
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,459
under this time limit.

226
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:05,759
Toy, let's do it.

227
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:06,619
Okay, prof.

228
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,539
Now.

229
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:09,359
Everyone's ready?

230
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,979
1..2..3..

231
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,379
Stop!

232
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,319
I think this part is weird.

233
00:23:58,619 --> 00:23:59,499
Let's do it again.

234
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,979
Go back 4 bars before this part.

235
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:04,999
Let's go.

236
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:06,659
Okay.

237
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,579
Everyone's ready?

238
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,299
3..4..

239
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,239
Stop!

240
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:14,379
Kim.

241
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:15,739
Sun.

242
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:18,639
What's wrong?

243
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:22,959
It wasn't like yesterday's.

244
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,299
It should get better as you play.

245
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:30,239
Why it's getting worse?

246
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:35,579
Uh...

247
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,519
I'm sorry.

248
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:38,379
But...

249
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,119
Can I try again?

250
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,159
I think it's enough.

251
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,059
Go practice separately

252
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,599
in pairs.

253
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,899
And come back here in the evening.

254
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,719
You all need to practice more.

255
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,959
It's not about an individual

256
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,259
but all of us.

257
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,799
Get it?

258
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:02,319
Yes, prof.

259
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,379
Now go.

260
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:13,659
Wait, Kim.

261
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,079
Where are you going?

262
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:17,859
Won't you practice?

263
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:19,719
I did more than enough.

264
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:21,519
It's you

265
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,219
who need more practice.

266
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:24,719
Focus on this.

267
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:25,939
But

268
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,919
we need to practice in pair.

269
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,399
Your partner

270
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:43,139
may not be me.

271
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,579
It's my dream

272
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,479
that you'll never understand.

273
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,239
Then come back to reality.

274
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,959
How much do I need to do to satisfy you?

275
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,151
Be my partner today.

276
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:39,271
Why?

277
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:42,131
There's no one else

278
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:43,871
so you choose me?

279
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:45,371
Usually,

280
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,491
you're my partner.

281
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:49,791
What?

282
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:51,651
Really?

283
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:52,791
Yeah.

284
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:54,751
Okay.

285
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,031
I hate a slowpoke.

286
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,431
You're sneaky bastard.

287
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:32,251
You can do better.

288
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:33,751
Out of practice?

289
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,691
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

290
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:45,971
Damn.

291
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:46,711
Enough!

292
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:48,711
This is a practice

293
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,231
not a murder scene.

294
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,591
It's my dream

295
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,531
that I have been dreaming.

296
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,771
You'll never understand it.

297
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:24,811
If it's a dream,

298
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,071
it'll be gone when you wake up.

299
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,091
Wake up!

300
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,831
Come back to reality.

301
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:41,771
Back to your world.

302
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:46,931
I just want to perform.

303
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:50,231
Just...

304
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:00,411
What more do I have to do?

305
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:06,791
How much do I need to do to satisfy you?

306
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,551
I don't know if I upset you or something.

307
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:16,431
But if I did,

308
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,371
you should know

309
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,091
that I didn't mean it.

310
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:34,191
Kim.

311
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:35,871
What have you done?

312
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,031
Isn't it too harsh?

313
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,091
I know that

314
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,051
you don't know what to do.

315
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,651
You're shy around him.

316
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,891
Don't put your frustration on him like that.

317
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,091
He cried!

318
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:50,711
Go console him.

319
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,271
Go, Kim.

320
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:53,971
Go!

321
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,251
You did the right thing.

322
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:01,591
If he wants to be in the band,

323
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,731
he needs more effort.

324
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:04,731
Right?

325
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,211
If he doesn't,

326
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:08,491
let him go.

327
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:10,711
He can keep crying.

328
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,511
But he needs more practice.

329
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:16,571
Not crying like this.

330
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:29,291
Damn!

331
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:31,491
Petch!

332
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:50,631
Why didn't you move?

333
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:53,271
Want to put blame on me?

334
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:55,931
I want to test

335
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,111
if you dare do it.

336
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:00,751
And then,

337
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,871
you did it.

338
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,971
What's wrong with you guys?

339
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:16,951
Pie.

340
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:21,091
Damn.

341
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:23,591
That's close.

342
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:33,091
Hey.

343
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:34,291
My code-brother.

344
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:36,271
Rain.

345
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,291
Congratulations

346
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:40,911
on being in the same club.

347
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:44,291
And...

348
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:45,411
your partner?

349
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:54,731
Don't tell me

350
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:56,291
it's my brother?

351
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:00,691
He went mad again?

352
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:06,491
Come.

353
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:07,851
I'll help you.

354
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:10,371
Really?

355
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:11,251
Yeah.

356
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,471
Come.

357
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,851
1..2..3..

358
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:37,591
Petch.

359
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:39,031
I...

360
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:41,451
I didn't mean it.

361
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:47,591
Are you okay?

362
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:03,851
You'd better mean it.

363
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:06,891
I'd feel a lot better.

364
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,411
Hey, Petch.

365
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,751
Petch!

366
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,331
What the hell?

367
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:25,911
This is like couple quarrel.

368
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:45,751
Not bad.

369
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:47,571
How did you learn?

370
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,171
It's self-taught

371
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,911
and imitate others.

372
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:01,911
For what?

373
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,251
For medication.

374
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:08,291
I heard that

375
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,771
music can heal people.

376
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:13,831
But curing disease

377
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,331
may be unlikely.

378
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:24,071
I have to go.

379
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:28,871
I leave it in your hands

380
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,291
to take care of my beloved club.

381
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,171
I need to practice rugby.

382
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:40,231
Come watch me too.

383
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:42,671
Thank you, Rain.

384
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:53,991
Don't forget my promise.

385
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:57,171
What?

386
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,191
You promised

387
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,991
you'll take care of my brother.

388
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,211
Bye, prof.

389
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:09,931
Thank you.

390
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:10,851
Sure.

391
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,051
Done practicing?

392
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:26,971
Where's Sun?

393
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,931
If you're looking for him, go find him by yourself.

394
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:31,331
Don't involve me.

395
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,056
Done practicing?

396
00:38:58,596 --> 00:38:59,276
Where's Sun?

397
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:03,276
If you're here for him, why ask me?

398
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:06,676
Because you...

399
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,916
Go look for him by yourself if you're here for him.

400
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:11,216
Don't involve me.

401
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,396
Glad to hear that from you.

402
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:20,256
Don't involve me, okay?

403
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:40,276
Petch.

404
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,036
I'm sorry.

405
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:11,636
Hey.

406
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:14,276
What are you doing?

407
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:21,356
I said I'm fine.

408
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:24,116
Never mind it.

409
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:40,696
Nothing.

410
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:43,276
Just

411
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:45,856
want to say

412
00:41:47,356 --> 00:41:48,136
I'm sorry.

413
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,636
If you want to apologize,

414
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,016
come with me.

415
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:02,596
Where to?

416
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:06,276
Bring your weapon.

417
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:22,536
I never knew

418
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:25,516
there's a place like this.

419
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,496
When I just transferred here

420
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,196
and didn't know anyone,

421
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,296
I have this place as a friend.

422
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:39,776
I like it here.

423
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:44,536
Really?

424
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,936
How can you play like that?

425
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:11,116
I

426
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,036
followed my emotion

427
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,776
not the sheet music,

428
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,916
nor memories.

429
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:23,576
You played by the song's emotion?

430
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:28,496
Um...

431
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:30,396
Something like that.

432
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,696
If you put effort in my job

433
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,636
as much as in what you carry,

434
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:17,876
I'd die peacefully.

435
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:19,016
Do I have freedom

436
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:21,456
to follow my own heart?

437
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:24,136
Duty comes before freedom.

438
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:25,336
Okay?

439
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:28,136
You're about to graduate.

440
00:46:28,596 --> 00:46:29,376
Aren't you glad?

441
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:32,116
Or you have something to care about?

442
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:36,996
Don't you want to have a lover?

443
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:56,716
Damn.

444
00:48:57,256 --> 00:48:58,336
You're stubborn.

445
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:20,456
Payoo!

446
00:49:40,756 --> 00:49:41,576
Why are you here?

447
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,196
You should be there instead of me.

448
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:47,356
To give others a chance

449
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:50,256
means you give yourself a chance.

450
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,416
How can you be a lone pine tree

451
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:53,676
in this big world?

452
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:57,136
Will you be able to survive?

453
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:06,236
Open up your heart.

454
00:50:10,616 --> 00:50:11,016
Bye.
