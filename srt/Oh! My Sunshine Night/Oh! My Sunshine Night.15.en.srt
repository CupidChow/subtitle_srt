1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,160
Master Kim's friends came here looking for him.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,760
I still can't figure out their motive.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,440
Didn't you hear our boss?

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,800
You need to find that kid before the officials.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,120
You must've forgotten our promise.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,600
Why do I

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,520
start forgetting things.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,720
Are there any other ways

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,240
to recover Master Kim's memory ?

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,400
He should be in a familiar environment.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,960
Or...

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,800
His special person.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,720
Sun...

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,520
What?!

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Nightmare again?

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,920
What's up there?

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,720
There must be.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,960
Right?

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Keep this.

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,600
Your shoes?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
If someone bullies you again, show these shoes to them

22
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
and say that you have a friend this big.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Of course.

24
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,160
With feet this big, body must be big too.

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
No one will dare bully me. Thank you.

26
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,920
Come at me, you big losers!

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
Do you know my friend?!

28
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
The Bigfoot!

29
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,720
Go!

30
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,960
Go!

31
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,200
Go!

32
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
This pill help with dissolving blood clots.

33
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,440
Let's see

34
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,640
if Mr. Kim's memory or this pill

35
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
will be the winner.

36
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:42,880
Er...

37
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
What's wrong, Master Kim?

38
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,840
How long

39
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
have we been here?

40
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,000
It feels like

41
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,000
I have a promise with someone.

42
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
But I can't remember.

43
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,240
What's that promise?

44
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Done with the meal?

45
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm... not hungry.

46
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,720
But you haven't had anything since yesterday.

47
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Please clear the table.

48
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,640
I'm not hungry.

49
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
I have to go.

50
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Snow...

51
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,760
You don't have chlorophyll

52
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
for photosynthesis.

53
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,600
How can you still live?

54
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
And is my life

55
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
missing something?

56
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,440
Why do I

57
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
feel like suffocating?

58
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Like there's no air

59
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
even though I'm alive.

60
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Why?

61
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
I talk to myself now?

62
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,760
Thank you, bigfoot.

63
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
For giving me good dreams.

64
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
Where have you been?

65
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
Do you know I miss you?

66
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,880
It's been too long, zombie.

67
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Yes?

68
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,720
Who's that?

69
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,240
This must be the best solution.

70
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,840
I hope I'm right.

71
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry, dad.

72
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I saw a lot of stories.

73
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,720
A male student.

74
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,960
Anything else?

75
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:11,501
Hey.

76
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,621
Weren't you going to pick up any calls?

77
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,501
Not even your friend?

78
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,071
Right.

79
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,531
Because of internship?

80
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,251
He finished it.

81
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:27,731
What's wrong?

82
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,261
Tell me now.

83
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:32,751
Or I'll spank your ass.

84
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:39,951
Waiting for someone?

85
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:42,951
Er...

86
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:44,091
Hey.

87
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,101
What's with so many questions?

88
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,331
You started it.

89
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:53,911
Hey!

90
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:54,551
I...

91
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:58,101
It's just a greeting.

92
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,381
Like 'What's up, man?'

93
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,821
But it's a question instead.

94
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:03,991
Then...

95
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,571
If you see me outside,

96
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,791
you can greet me like that.

97
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:11,151
Yo! Yo! Wassup?

98
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:15,301
Okay.

99
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,491
I'll answer you all.

100
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:21,861
I didn't pick up any calls.

101
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,861
Neither friends

102
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:25,861
nor upperclassmen

103
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,911
even though I finished my internship.

104
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,901
And I'm fine.

105
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:33,071
And...

106
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,031
I don't like spanking!

107
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:38,421
That's all?

108
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:41,221
And...

109
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,171
Who are you waiting for?

110
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,711
You didn't answer mine.

111
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,341
Hello, Paul. How are you?

112
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,051
Hi, Sookwan.

113
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,691
Actually, I am not fine.

114
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,531
Because I am still waiting for your response.

115
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:29,991
It's been so long.

116
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,871
And my partners always ask me about

117
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,131
our big deal of the business.

118
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:36,791
Before we begin,

119
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:40,461
shall we have a look at the main points on the agenda?

120
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,391
Paul, Please.

121
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:42,971
Wait.

122
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:46,871
Considering that I would like to suggest you.

123
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,621
Please endure for my paper.

124
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,461
I mean about the contract.

125
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:55,591
Right now, my main priority is solve the problem with my shareholder.

126
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:57,221
Okay.

127
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:58,171
I know

128
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,291
it is my problem, not yours.

129
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,501
That sounds great to us.

130
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,701
Thanks for your understanding.

131
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:08,311
I know but our absolute bottom line is paper.

132
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,501
Do it for us, Sookwan.

133
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,631
Please.

134
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,231
Thank you for your attention.

135
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:16,471
I promise.

136
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:17,861
See you soon.

137
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:18,751
Bye.

138
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,151
Damn!

139
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,381
Who could make it within two weeks?!

140
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:32,351
And those two damn kids are in hiding.

141
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,631
No matter how hard I try,

142
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,541
I'll have to find them.

143
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,651
Feel better?

144
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:20,771
I don't know why

145
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,131
when I look underwater,

146
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,021
I feel unusually calm.

147
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:31,851
In the past,

148
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,271
you like diving underwater

149
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:36,611
when you feel sad.

150
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,211
Underwater?

151
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:42,391
Yes.

152
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,571
Until Master Rain...

153
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:46,591
Er...

154
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:49,031
I...

155
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,811
called it your comfort zone.

156
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:56,551
When you feel sad,

157
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:58,871
and dive down,

158
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,311
it'd heal you completely.

159
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:07,831
Should I dive down there?

160
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:11,811
Of course.

161
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,751
I'll do it with you.

162
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,411
Come, young master.

163
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:33,431
Okay.

164
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:42,911
Follow me.

165
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,941
1...2...3...

166
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:09,581
Hey.

167
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:10,931
You spy!

168
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:12,051
This little?

169
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,541
You got the nerve coming here.

170
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,631
How was it?

171
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:57,751
Er...

172
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,451
I...

173
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,631
I saw a lot of stories.

174
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,431
Two boys.

175
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,821
A male university student.

176
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:13,901
Er...

177
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,971
Is there anything else?

178
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:25,951
I can't remember.

179
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,461
Just that?

180
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:34,701
Yeah.

181
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:47,891
Who are you

182
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:50,381
to get inside my head?

183
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:11,941
Payoo!

184
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:13,611
Payoo!

185
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,591
Who else could it be?

186
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:27,491
Who's there?!

187
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:43,288
Payoo!

188
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:49,368
Snow.

189
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:56,878
Who's there?!

190
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,278
Someone's here?

191
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:15,848
It's just me.

192
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:19,188
And who's there?

193
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:22,878
Payoo.

194
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:24,968
Payoo.

195
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:27,718
Payoo.

196
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:02,238
Master Kim.

197
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:05,368
What's wrong?

198
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:07,188
What happened?

199
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:09,368
Nothing.

200
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:10,848
I just...

201
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:13,528
saw someone around the stable.

202
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:15,788
And walked here.

203
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:20,368
I don't think there's anyone else.

204
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,928
There's just us two.

205
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:24,598
It's impossible.

206
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,878
And...

207
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:31,358
This place is not in any maps.

208
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:33,668
No one else can be here.

209
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:36,468
Right.

210
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:37,708
Then...

211
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,128
I must be seeing things.

212
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:41,668
Sorry.

213
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:44,798
It's okay.

214
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,528
You should get some rest.

215
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:50,628
Okay.

216
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:31,768
Hello.

217
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:33,238
Hi.

218
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,368
You're here often.

219
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:37,528
Yeah.

220
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:40,988
We have bird's nests today.

221
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:43,568
They're from the locals. Very clean.

222
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:44,388
Want some?

223
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,908
Um... Then...

224
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,008
Give me 5 dozens.

225
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:50,728
Okay.

226
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:54,308
You seem to like it.

227
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:57,148
You can call me beforehand,

228
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,348
so I can keep some for you.

229
00:28:59,308 --> 00:28:59,668
Oh.

230
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:01,038
It's fine.

231
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:03,798
I'll drop by when I'm around.

232
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:04,988
Okay.

233
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:08,928
I'll look over there.

234
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:09,788
Okay.

235
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,528
Someone's selling stocks?

236
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:24,588
Buy them all. No matter the cost.

237
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:28,118
But it's very pricey right now.

238
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:30,368
Do as I said!

239
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,168
Who'd sell such a big lot?

240
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:38,708
Done, boss.

241
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,308
Keep monitoring if someone's selling again.

242
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:43,958
Yes, boss.

243
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:50,598
Who are they?

244
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:54,628
Want to speculate stock?

245
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:25,888
Keep buying them

246
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,108
while you can.

247
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,568
I have a lot more to sell.

248
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:15,808
Kim!

249
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:30,588
Kim.

250
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:31,878
Kim.

251
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:39,918
It's really you.

252
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:48,918
It's not that I didn't try.

253
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,208
I tried looking for you everywhere.

254
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:53,168
Anywhere I thought you could be.

255
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,478
But I couldn't find you.

256
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:17,934
It's really you.

257
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:23,694
Who are you?

258
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:25,934
Aww...

259
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:27,854
It's been only 3 months.

260
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:29,734
You're better at cracking jokes.

261
00:33:31,654 --> 00:33:32,734
You know my name.

262
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:39,774
I'm not sure

263
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,214
if we've ever met.

264
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:53,174
By the way,

265
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:55,974
how did you get here?

266
00:33:59,054 --> 00:33:59,374
Well...

267
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:01,934
Payoo...

268
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:04,574
You know Payoo?

269
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:14,494
I'm sorry.

270
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:17,654
That's my apple.

271
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:21,414
Give it back.

272
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,214
I understand.

273
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:28,934
You must be furious.

274
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:32,294
It's not that I didn't try.

275
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,374
I tried looking for you everywhere.

276
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:37,694
Anywhere you could go.

277
00:34:38,414 --> 00:34:40,054
Anywhere I could find you.

278
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,294
But I couldn't find you.

279
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:47,934
Why would I be angry?

280
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:52,374
Why are you looking for me?

281
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:55,214
This is our first meet.

282
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:57,734
You confused me.

283
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:02,694
Okay.

284
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:04,854
Say whatever you want.

285
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,214
It's my fault too

286
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:10,814
that I didn't try hard enough.

287
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:13,854
Satisfied?

288
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:39,774
This is a private property.

289
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:42,654
You coming here

290
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:44,934
is trespassing.

291
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,094
Please leave.

292
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:51,614
Kim!

293
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:53,974
Payoo.

294
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:56,694
There's a trespasser.

295
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,494
Take care of him.

296
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:07,494
Master Kim!

297
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:08,414
Master.

298
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:18,454
So beautiful.

299
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,254
10 across the board.

300
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:20,974
Right.

301
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,774
I couldn't believe that there's a place like this

302
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,374
in remote wilderness.

303
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:29,494
Hey!

304
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:33,214
Are you not going to help me with this?

305
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:35,094
Oh!

306
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,854
I didn't mean you.

307
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:39,614
I'll help with your luggage.

308
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:41,334
Hey!

309
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:42,814
Help me!

310
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:46,734
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Damn this kids.

311
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:48,614
I was in awe with the scenery.

312
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:48,894
Come.

313
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:49,574
I'll help.

314
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:50,614
No need!

315
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:51,734
Why?

316
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:52,854
It's all done.

317
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:54,614
Get your own stuff.

318
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:56,894
No one's here.

319
00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:59,134
Just as Payoo said.

320
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:02,574
It's a safe house.

321
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,974
Like rich people would have.

322
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:06,494
Why?

323
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:08,734
You're not as rich.

324
00:37:09,254 --> 00:37:10,174
So you envy him?

325
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:13,414
Why?

326
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,134
I won't envy what's not mine.

327
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:16,694
Why you said it then?

328
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:19,454
Calm down.

329
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:20,934
Enough.

330
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,734
We came here because Payoo said so.

331
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:24,614
Okay?

332
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:28,614
By the way...

333
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:31,494
Where's Kim?

334
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:33,454
Yeah.

335
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:34,774
Right.

336
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:36,734
He's not here.

337
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:38,694
Hey, Toy.

338
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,094
This villa is bigger than just this.

339
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:44,134
He might be somewhere else.

340
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:45,214
Where?

341
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:47,254
And...

342
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:48,614
Where's Sun?

343
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:50,694
Maybe...

344
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:53,094
He's following his heart.

345
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,174
Hey!

346
00:37:59,334 --> 00:37:59,974
You two.

347
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:01,134
Stop glaring.

348
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,214
That's too much.

349
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,654
Carry these inside.

350
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,094
Go!

351
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:09,054
Don't touch that pink one.

352
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:10,894
I'll carry Baibua's.

353
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:12,094
Go.

354
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:13,254
Hurry.

355
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:41,654
I don't understand.

356
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:44,414
Why was Kim so mad at me?

357
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,534
It's not that I didn't try.

358
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:51,614
It's not okay to blame me.

359
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,934
The world doesn't revolve around him.

360
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:06,614
There's something I didn't tell anyone.

361
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:11,054
I want everyone to know at the same time.

362
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:12,654
So it's safer.

363
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:16,934
Master Kim...

364
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,374
lost his memories.

365
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:28,454
Are you teaming up with him?

366
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,934
This is not April Fools' Day.

367
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,374
I have to apologize to you

368
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,014
and your friends.

369
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:42,614
I want to run a test about

370
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,894
how bad is his memory loss.

371
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:48,774
What do you mean?

372
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,894
From the motorcycle accident that day,

373
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:55,254
the doctor said,

374
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:59,054
Master Kim has intracerebral hemorrhage.

375
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:02,814
That blood clot can damage his brain.

376
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:08,694
But the damage will occur or not depends on

377
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,934
if the blood clots can be dissolved.

378
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,974
No one really knows if it would

379
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:17,814
or would not.

380
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:20,174
But...

381
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:22,574
The symptom indicated that

382
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,294
it didn't.

383
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:30,894
His memory

384
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,414
is now lost partially.

385
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,934
So he can only remember

386
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:41,214
some of his memories in his life.

387
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:43,934
And...

388
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:46,654
He may forget someone

389
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:50,494
or remember someone.

390
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:53,054
So...

391
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:54,854
Er...

392
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:57,734
Why doesn't he get a treatment

393
00:40:58,294 --> 00:40:59,454
before it's too late?

394
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:04,934
We tried our best.

395
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:06,694
But...

396
00:41:07,974 --> 00:41:09,334
What's more important

397
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:13,054
is his survival.

398
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:15,454
It's the most important.

399
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:19,614
Right now,

400
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:23,054
we can't trust anyone.

401
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:26,254
To bring someone here

402
00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:27,774
or to go out

403
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,014
is both risky.

404
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:34,734
So I have to hide him here.

405
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:37,014
And I hope that...

406
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:41,894
The coming of his friends and his special ones

407
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:46,014
will bring back his memories.

408
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:51,494
It didn't make any sense.

409
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:53,614
You should get him to hospital.

410
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:02,014
Our masters' passing

411
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:07,614
wasn't an accident.

412
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:12,934
What?!

413
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,654
You mean...

414
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,294
It's the assassination of Kannakul family

415
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,134
including Master Rain.

416
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:30,574
And...

417
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:33,614
What should we do?

418
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:38,054
If we love him,

419
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:40,734
stay by him.

420
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:42,974
Give him hope.

421
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:46,414
Get him through this mess.

422
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:47,774
Just that.

423
00:42:49,494 --> 00:42:50,614
Other matters

424
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:53,174
are being taken care of.

425
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:55,894
This is unbelievable.

426
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:57,774
I can't believe it.

427
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:01,494
Yeah.

428
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:05,814
It's too much for people like us.

429
00:44:04,414 --> 00:44:05,174
Is there something

430
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,694
up there?

431
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:08,374
I think

432
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:10,134
it's a promise.

433
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:12,374
With whom?

434
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:15,174
If Kim can't remember you,

435
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:18,094
will you forget about him?

436
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:21,134
What have you done?

437
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:22,894
There's no other ways.

438
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:24,694
Retrieve every phone.

439
00:44:25,254 --> 00:44:26,214
Remove their SIM card.

440
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:29,134
I know where Kimhan is now.

441
00:44:29,854 --> 00:44:30,414
What?

442
00:44:34,534 --> 00:44:35,334
Who's there?!

443
00:46:48,094 --> 00:46:48,614
Snow White.

444
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:49,734
Snow White!

445
00:46:52,014 --> 00:46:52,734
What's wrong?

446
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:55,934
You're usually tame.
