1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,260
When?

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,510
14th February

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,640
Let's watch it together.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,920
Isn't that Sookwan's van?

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,850
Not in Lampang's direction.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,320
What?!

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,420
Do something!

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,840
Goodbye.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,580
Dad!

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,790
You're okay by yourself?

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,590
Don't worry.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,190
I'll come back to compete diving with you, brother.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,250
Ouch.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,160
I will not let you hurt again.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,780
If you want to do me a favor,

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,870
take care of Kim while I'm not here.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,200
Dad.

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,360
I know

19
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,610
how you feel right now.

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,320
You're human.

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
It's okay to be sad.

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,170
But our duty right now

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,180
is to protect Master Kim.

24
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,000
If you're like this,

25
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,910
how can you protect anyone?

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,950
Okay.

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,850
Even if it's just 1%,

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,640
it's our hope. Right?

29
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,480
Yes, dad.

30
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,920
Right now,

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
Master Kim has Intracerebral Hemorrhage.

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,800
And with his physical state right now,

33
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,770
he's not ready for a surgery.

34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,060
This will cause him partial memory loss.

35
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,840
Also, he may process information more slowly.

36
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,460
We can only allow some time to heal him.

37
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,230
Okay.

38
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,610
And for Master Rain.

39
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,850
I'll contact Chiang Rai's governor

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,490
to see if he can help.

41
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

42
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Sun.

43
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,910
I have no one left.

44
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,740
I've got no one else.

45
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,450
No one.

46
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,280
Calm down, Kim.

47
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,570
There'll be no more tragedy.

48
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,000
I've got no one.

49
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,440
Butler.

50
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,350
What happened?

51
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,280
Er...

52
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,850
Honestly,

53
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,720
I can't believe this actually happened.

54
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,210
It's too sudden to come to terms with it.

55
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
How about Rain?

56
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,380
I heard he's still missing.
How are they handling it?

57
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,540
The officials are searching for him.

58
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,360
It's a very dark tropical rain forest.

59
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,230
They can only go on foot.

60
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,940
What do we do now?

61
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:03,950
By the way,

62
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,080
how did you come back?

63
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,070
Er...

64
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,930
I had a meeting in Lampang.

65
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,880
So I split up with them at villa in Chiang Rai and came back to Bangkok.

66
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,760
Otherwise, I'd be on that helicopter too.

67
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:18,960
Really?

68
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,720
And...

69
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,840
How's Kimhan?

70
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,890
He's better now.

71
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,520
But his mental state is bad.

72
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,100
Nobody would expect to face this many tragedies at the same time.

73
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,180
Parents have died,

74
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,460
and brother's missing.

75
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,640
Right.

76
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
Look on the bright side, they now rest in peace.

77
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,480
Family

78
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,540
will be together forever.

79
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
Here's an update about the flood

80
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,210
in many regions from consecutive rainfall.

81
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,390
We got the picture of a coffin floating in the flood.

82
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,580
The locals found it strange

83
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,550
while the viewers thought it's a bad omen.

84
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,100
Let's look at the picture.

85
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,010
Auntie.

86
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm sorry for your loss, Kimhan.

87
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,690
Thank you.

88
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,790
Are you okay?

89
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm fine.

90
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,930
I'm glad you're okay.

91
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,760
I was very worried when I heart the news.

92
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,280
Ah huh.

93
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,790
Payoo.

94
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,030
Take good care of Kimhan.

95
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,080
It'd be bad if anything happens to him.

96
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,560
Okay.

97
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,760
I'll take good care of him.

98
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,560
Thank you, Payoo.

99
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,650
Butler.

100
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,390
It must be tiring.

101
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,210
Yeah.

102
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,780
I've got to go now.
I'll drop by tomorrow.

103
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,960
Yes, doctor.

104
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,770
Are they performing autopsy at this hospital?

105
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,360
Yes.

106
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,470
The police said so.

107
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,460
They want to thoroughly inspect before assuming it's an accident.

108
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,210
I believe it's their procedure.

109
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,070
And...

110
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,980
About Mr. Kacha's business,

111
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,490
can Kimhan take care of that?

112
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,360
But...

113
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,250
Mr. Rain isn't found yet.

114
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,360
We'll discuss about this later.

115
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,870
But for now,

116
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
we don't want to do anything yet.

117
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,740
Well,

118
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,220
I'm worried about you guys.

119
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,480
If the news spreads tomorrow,

120
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm sure the stock price of Kannakul Group

121
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,020
will be in shambles.

122
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,500
I understand your feelings.

123
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,080
But for the investors, partners, and businessmen,

124
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,480
I don't think they will.

125
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you, doctor.

126
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,480
I've been a shareholder for a long time.

127
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,240
If you need any help,

128
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
you can tell me.

129
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,730
I will.

130
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,830
Payoo.

131
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,390
Take good care of Kimhan.

132
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,110
You'll be a lot more tiring.

133
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,560
Er...

134
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,710
Okay.

135
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,140
I want to keep their bodies

136
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,610
as an evidence.

137
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,370
Do you think...

138
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,660
Master Kim is in danger.

139
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:12,788
I have to keep watching Master Kim.

140
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,308
Thank you for coming.

141
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:18,228
Sure, Payoo.

142
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:23,308
Shun.

143
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:28,228
Your Rain will be fine.

144
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,788
Don't worry.

145
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:34,108
Okay.

146
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,708
I hope so.

147
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:43,788
Right now,

148
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,828
Master Kim needs hope.

149
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,108
I'm sure Sun can give him.

150
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,868
You're the only one

151
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:00,708
Master Kim let you see his tears.

152
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:11,028
Payoo.

153
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:12,428
Then,

154
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,428
we'll have to go now.

155
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:18,828
If there's any update,

156
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,628
please tell me.

157
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:24,548
Sure.

158
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,508
I'll only send good news.

159
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:30,508
Okay.

160
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:32,828
Thank you.

161
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,388
Goodbye, Payoo.

162
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,228
Yes, dad.

163
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,468
I have arranged a new patient room tomorrow.

164
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,708
There's too much press down there.

165
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:11,228
Yes, dad.

166
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:12,948
If something's wrong,

167
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,228
call me immediately.

168
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:43,548
The flight was book for four.

169
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:46,988
But why Sookwan came back first?

170
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:52,428
Why did she change her plan so suddenly?

171
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:56,268
Weird.

172
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,388
There must be

173
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:05,628
a hotel booking somewhere.

174
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:38,028
The stronger get to live

175
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,108
while the weaker

176
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:46,948
must be pruned.

177
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,108
Why would I keep them?

178
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,708
Is there any update about Rain?

179
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:41,828
Payoo.

180
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,388
Not at all.

181
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,308
But I'm following every news channel.

182
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:13,828
Er...

183
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,228
Excuse me.

184
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,428
Your friends are here.

185
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:26,788
Kim.

186
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:29,468
How are you?

187
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,908
I'm so worried.

188
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,468
Sun told me last night.

189
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,508
I'm fine.

190
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,188
It's better now.

191
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,068
Thank you.

192
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:49,668
Hi, Kim.

193
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:53,828
Hey, Kim.

194
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,028
Er...

195
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:08,348
Thank you all

196
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:09,788
for coming.

197
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:12,068
Right now,

198
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:13,388
I'm feeling better.

199
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,228
Are you sure?

200
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:18,988
Yeah.

201
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,268
I've talked with the hospital

202
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,668
that I want to preserve both our Masters' body.

203
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:47,748
When everything's better,

204
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,708
we'll hold a funeral.

205
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,428
What's wrong?

206
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,428
I want to keep their body as an evidence

207
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,508
if what I think is true.

208
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:08,148
Master Rain's incident is also not over.

209
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,308
There may be something

210
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,068
more than just an accident.

211
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,988
- You mean...
- We'll take about this later.

212
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:21,428
Not here.

213
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:25,508
Okay.

214
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:27,628
Right now,

215
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:30,468
you must protect Master Kim.

216
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,748
Don't let him out of sight.

217
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,988
You think...

218
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:38,148
Master Kim may be in danger.

219
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,068
Master Kim is in danger.

220
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:55,788
Get me a car.

221
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,428
I'll go to the hospital.

222
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:00,028
And I'll finish everything.

223
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:02,148
If something happens to you,

224
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,108
Kannakul Group will be in ruin.

225
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:20,096
[Still no trace of missing person from helicopter crash.]

226
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:23,086
Currently, the forest rangers and local police in Chiang Rai

227
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:25,616
are still searching for Mr. Wasan.

228
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:28,036
But still no trace of him.

229
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,746
[Still no trace of missing person from helicopter crash.]

230
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:41,346
Hello.

231
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,246
Hello.

232
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:45,766
How are you, Kimhan?

233
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:49,936
I'm feeling better.

234
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:54,996
Get well soon.

235
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:00,786
Thank you.

236
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:03,456
Come.

237
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:05,376
I'll help.

238
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,466
Have you heard anything about Rain?

239
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:18,246
Not at all.

240
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,246
Poor you.

241
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:24,996
No one can take care of Kimhan's.

242
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:27,766
Except for you, Butler.

243
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:33,586
I don't have any other relatives.

244
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:36,656
Uncle Santi

245
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,506
is like my family.

246
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,406
Thank you.

247
00:23:44,286 --> 00:23:44,686
Sure.

248
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,906
Be strong, Kim.

249
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:54,676
Then, we'll leave now.

250
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:56,726
Yeah.

251
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:57,536
Then,

252
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:59,026
we have to go.

253
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:00,286
We'll come again.

254
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:01,566
Be strong.

255
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:09,826
Thank you.

256
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:10,386
Bye.

257
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,076
Goodbye.

258
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:17,766
Goodbye.

259
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:27,636
This is far from the press.

260
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:28,976
Safe and sound.

261
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:30,646
Yeah.

262
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:36,706
I hope this is the safest place for him.

263
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:43,746
Right now,

264
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:46,146
we haven't heard anything about Rain?

265
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:47,526
Yeah.

266
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,816
But I requested for a diver team.

267
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:54,066
Because there's a big waterfall nearby.

268
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,526
You're cautious, butler.

269
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:02,176
It's my duty.

270
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:07,346
Duty to protect everyone in Kannakul family.

271
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,406
I'm here to visit Kimhan.

272
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:17,056
Then I'll go to a shareholder meeting at Kannakul Group.

273
00:25:17,686 --> 00:25:20,446
Everything's been in chaos at the company

274
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,316
since Mr. Kacha's passing.

275
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,796
I'm sorry I said that.

276
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:36,726
It's okay.

277
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,146
It's the fact.

278
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:44,166
I'll have to bother you.

279
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:47,076
Don't worry.

280
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:16,366
You need to rest.

281
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:18,206
Take care of yourself.

282
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:20,656
If something happens to you,

283
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:23,476
Kannakul Group will be in ruin.

284
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:31,316
I'll leave now.

285
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:32,366
Goodbye.

286
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:52,816
To Kannakul Group.

287
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:04,466
Mr. Pakdee, are you at Kannakul Group now?

288
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,016
I'm sorry for the wait.

289
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,476
I called for an urgent board of director meeting

290
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,346
because of the reason you already know.

291
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:54,506
We have many urgent matters to take care of.

292
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:58,256
But Mr. Kacha's just passed away.

293
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,886
Should we give him some respect?

294
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:03,686
Mr. Pakdee

295
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:05,306
and everyone.

296
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,986
Have you seen our stock price this morning?

297
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:11,456
All of our properties

298
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,686
are now at record-low.

299
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,086
If we don't hurry,

300
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:20,656
your stock value will go lower and lower.

301
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,586
Until there's none.

302
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:25,566
When that time comes,

303
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,366
even if we have 10 Mr. Kacha,

304
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,816
we won't be able to turn the table anymore.

305
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,616
No matter how urgent it is,

306
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:39,426
we need to elect new CEO by every board member.

307
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:45,106
You're all here now.

308
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:48,646
I think we can do it now.

309
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,866
Shouldn't we make it an agenda?

310
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,136
Agenda came from people.

311
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:58,176
I believe that

312
00:28:58,926 --> 00:29:00,616
we can all do it today.

313
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:03,366
If you all agree,

314
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,816
please raise your hand.

315
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:37,446
The majority in this room's voted for an urgent agenda.

316
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:39,466
Great.

317
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,656
I like working with flexible team.

318
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,536
It's fun.

319
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:47,566
I,

320
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:50,666
as a 25% shareholder of Kannakul Group,

321
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,176
announce that I am now a new CEO to replace the former

322
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,056
who passed away.

323
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:59,226
But his eldest heir,

324
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:02,096
Mr. Wasan Kannakul is also a 25% shareholder.

325
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,256
Where is he then?

326
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,686
If he doesn't appear,

327
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:11,096
I'll claim this right.

328
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,626
We also have Mr. Kimhan.

329
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,406
Kimhan is not elected from Mr. Kacha,

330
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:17,896
former president.

331
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,886
If that's all,

332
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:23,776
I'll start our first meeting agenda.

333
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:41,286
You'll have to decide if you want to undergo a surgery or not.

334
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,266
Or parents can decide for you.

335
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,026
If the surgery fails,

336
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:51,606
will I forget some of my memories?

337
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,386
Like what?

338
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,976
Childhood memory.

339
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,146
Honestly,

340
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,726
I have to say that

341
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:11,496
there's a chance of partial memory loss.

342
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,186
But I couldn't say which part of your memory

343
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,696
will be affected.

344
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,166
For someone,

345
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:27,006
memory is just a past.

346
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:29,856
But for me,

347
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,336
it's not just that.

348
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:38,856
It's up to your decision.

349
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:46,846
She's a real viper.

350
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,166
She bit me hard.

351
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,856
She believes now that Mr. Kacha and his wife are gone,

352
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:56,066
and Mr. Wasan is missing,

353
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:58,376
everything is in her hand.

354
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:00,526
She can do anything with the company.

355
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,066
She's faster than we thought.

356
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:07,646
It'll take like a month to finish the inheritance process.

357
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:11,086
By that time, Kannakul Group will have nothing left.

358
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,646
Mr. Kimhan should combine his shares with Mr. Kacha

359
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,816
to have more than 51% of all shares.

360
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:20,266
We need Mr. Kimhan to do this.

361
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:22,526
This is family matters.

362
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:24,736
You know about this more than me.

363
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:26,126
Yes.

364
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,526
The most important pawn

365
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,016
is Mr. Kimhan alone.

366
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,386
Get me a car.

367
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,016
I'll go to the hospital.

368
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,686
And I'll finish everything.

369
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,216
You need to do it now.

370
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:50,686
Why so hurry?

371
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,286
Master Kim is in danger.

372
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,186
Why are you so sure?

373
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,096
Isn't it too risky.

374
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,646
The most dangerous place

375
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:09,606
can be the safest.

376
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,146
The less people know

377
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:16,946
the better it is.

378
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,016
I'll do it immediately.

379
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:32,466
Master Kim.

380
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:35,766
Uncle.

381
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:38,206
Something's wrong?

382
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:39,616
Yes.

383
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:49,246
Oh, sorry.
Wrong room.

384
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,606
Let's hurry.

385
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:26,466
It's time.

386
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:28,446
Okay.

387
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:30,546
This way.

388
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:43,686
Er...

389
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:46,866
We need to turn off every device.

390
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,006
Okay.

391
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:03,866
Thank you.

392
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,206
[Kim]
I need to tell you something. Urgent.

393
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,286
[Kim]
I need to tell you something. Urgent.

394
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:05,726
[Kim]
I need to tell you something. Urgent.

395
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:13,846
[What's wrong?]

396
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:25,636
What's with him?

397
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,726
No signal?

398
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:18,206
This is the last place

399
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:22,686
that my parents and Rain

400
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:24,966
came to?

401
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:32,716
Yes.

402
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:37,566
Payoo.

403
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:41,606
I have to stay here

404
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:46,426
because Uncle Santi and you

405
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:50,156
believe there's more than just an accident?

406
00:38:57,156 --> 00:38:57,406
Yes.

407
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:03,226
Can you tell me

408
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:05,166
who did this?

409
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:08,516
Er...

410
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:14,156
You have to stay here.

411
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:18,446
This is the safest place for you.

412
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:25,716
It looks like

413
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:27,866
no one's here.

414
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:33,636
Yes.

415
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,956
Just you and me.

416
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:35,396
Er...

417
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,676
Do you

418
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,746
want me to take you to your room?

419
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:51,186
Not yet.

420
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:54,626
I want to stay here.

421
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:57,676
You go first.

422
00:41:01,716 --> 00:41:02,326
Ah...

423
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:03,266
Then,

424
00:41:03,686 --> 00:41:04,986
I'll cook something.

425
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:08,526
Thank you.

426
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,306
Oh, sorry.
Wrong room.

427
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:08,956
Oh!

428
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:10,676
Miss...

429
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:13,356
I'm Dr. Sookwan.

430
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:14,786
We've met.

431
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:18,566
You're not in the wrong room.

432
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,486
Just the wrong time.

433
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,036
What do you mean?

434
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:26,396
Kimhan got discharged.

435
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:29,066
Eh?

436
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:30,826
Really?

437
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,276
You didn't know?

438
00:42:36,226 --> 00:42:36,946
Weird.

439
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:43,306
People who can reach him

440
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:46,526
must be really privileged.

441
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:50,846
You should be one of them.

442
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:56,506
But you don't even know.

443
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:58,086
Yes.

444
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,146
I can't contact him.

445
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,266
I guess you can't either.

446
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,946
As long as you call him Kimhan,

447
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:11,196
then,

448
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:13,566
you're not so privileged either.

449
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:19,506
Clever.

450
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:21,546
Young boy.

451
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,076
I don't think that's a compliment.

452
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:35,026
I'm sorry.

453
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,276
I thought no one's here.

454
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:45,756
If you can contact him,

455
00:43:46,716 --> 00:43:48,126
or he contacts you,

456
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:50,506
call me.

457
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:03,126
Chatting with you is fun.

458
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:06,266
Let's chat again later,

459
00:44:07,796 --> 00:44:09,506
when we meet Kimhan.

460
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:12,926
Okay.

461
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:31,606
Hope you can eat this.

462
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:35,596
Thank you.

463
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:38,106
Er...

464
00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:45,506
How about yours?

465
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:49,906
I'm not hungry.

466
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:51,466
I'll eat later.

467
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:56,646
You already know

468
00:44:58,046 --> 00:44:59,426
I hate eating alone.

469
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,366
Next time,

470
00:45:04,276 --> 00:45:06,066
please cook for two.

471
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:10,846
Er...

472
00:45:12,806 --> 00:45:13,556
Please.

473
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:15,826
I beg you.

474
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,146
Don't make me feel more lonely.

475
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:26,676
Okay.

476
00:45:27,636 --> 00:45:28,206
Thank you.

477
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:30,516
Okay.

478
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,636
Clean the dust.

479
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:07,846
I insist

480
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:12,726
that every speck of dust of Kannakul family be cleaned.

481
00:46:13,986 --> 00:46:16,646
Several friends of Master Kim are here.

482
00:46:16,866 --> 00:46:20,106
I don't know of their intentions yet.

483
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:21,246
Master Kim.

484
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:24,316
Er...

485
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,356
Do we really need that?

486
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:33,996
Where have you been?

487
00:46:34,506 --> 00:46:35,046
You know

488
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:36,486
everyone's worried.

489
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:34,086
Er...

490
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:37,396
We need to turn off every device.
