1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,920
Do you best.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,940
Can't wait to hear it.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,140
We need to practice in pair.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,700
Your partner may not be me.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,280
You denied working at my place to work here.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,800
Just allowing me to live there

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,140
is more than enough.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,480
You're always like this

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,620
since you're young.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,160
Since I was young,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,160
my feelings have always been the same.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,280
Never changes.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,020
If you want to apologize,

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,980
come with me.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,460
Thank you.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Uh huh.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,260
Sun!

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,080
Why do you have to carry it around?
Not leaving it at university?

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,520
I have to always practice.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,720
Sounds fun.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,380
I'm jealous.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,020
Jealous?

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,320
You get to do what you like.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,260
That's what I envy the most.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,100
You can do what you want too.

27
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,140
Really?

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,040
Bye.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,560
See you tomorrow.

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,640
See you.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,260
Sun!

32
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,800
I didn't know

33
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,460
you want to take a walk.

34
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,660
Or you want to be alone?

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,500
No.

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,140
If I want to be alone,

37
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,940
I wouldn't invite you.

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,820
Well, you seem quiet.

39
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm normally quiet.

40
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,780
I don't think so.

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,400
You normally like to scold me.

42
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,640
Hey.

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,260
You think I'm that kind of person?

44
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,500
Sometimes.

45
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,340
Really?

46
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,140
Yes!

47
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,760
Why the laugh?

48
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,320
Well,

49
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,960
I'm in a good mood.

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,680
You should laugh too.

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
Laugh for me.

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,880
I want to see.

53
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,300
Now.

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
That's fake.

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
Are you hungry?

56
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,460
Milk and toast is delicious here.

57
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,300
Want to try?

58
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I didn't bring a wallet.

59
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,460
Hey.

60
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,700
This is my area.

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
It's my treat.

62
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,260
I eat a lot.

63
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,620
I can afford that.

64
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,300
Take a seat.

65
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,500
Two glasses of milk and two slices of toast.

66
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,960
Enjoy your meal.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Thank you.

68
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,340
Thank you so much

69
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,420
for everything.

70
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
For what?

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,040
There's nothing to thank for.

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,760
Well,

73
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,820
It's for everything.

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
And...

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,020
Today,

76
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,240
For being my partner.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,060
Thank you too.

78
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,860
For being my partner.

79
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,620
You make our band more completed.

80
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,200
Hey.

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,060
When you say nice stuffs,

82
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,960
you're so warm.

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
So cozy.

84
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,980
No way.

85
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,680
Everyone says

86
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm cold to the core.

87
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm being real.

88
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,220
If you speak more,

89
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,100
say only nice things,

90
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
and try to open up more,

91
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
you'll be hot.

92
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,460
Don't you want to have a lover?

93
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,200
Having a lover isn't related to speaking more.

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,180
Less talking, more honesty

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
is better.

96
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,060
But

97
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,420
if you don't speak,

98
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,560
no one knows what you think.

99
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,820
Right?

100
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,820
This milk is...

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,680
delicious.

102
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,420
Yeah.

103
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,300
Toast is good too.

104
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,900
Try it.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,380
Okay.

106
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,180
It's so tiring today.

107
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,220
Aren't you tired from both working and studying?

108
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,240
Sometimes.

109
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,140
What can I do?

110
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,840
Right.

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,460
Oh, hey.

112
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,420
You saw the old lady in black shirt?

113
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,960
Why?

114
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,940
She's been here 3 days in a row.

115
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,200
She came for me.

116
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,580
Wow.

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,480
Really?

118
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,060
Of course.

119
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
Have you seen her car?

120
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,440
Her car costs as much as a house!

121
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,320
And?

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
She asked me to stay with her.

123
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,500
I want a happier life.

124
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,800
Not having to work like this.

125
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
That's up to you.

126
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
Hey.

127
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,300
Actually,

128
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,720
I've made up my mind.

129
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,800
I'll go.

130
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,880
I see many customers take an interest in you.

131
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,500
But you

132
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,200
always play hard to get.

133
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,440
Don't you want a better life?

134
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,140
I'm okay.

135
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm happy with this life.

136
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,220
This?

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,380
Not sure about going left or right.

138
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,400
Not knowing where to go.

139
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,600
Geng!

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,240
Yes?

141
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,120
Serve Gamja-tung and rice to Table 3.

142
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,200
Okay.

143
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
He always uses me.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,340
Bye.

145
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,540
See ya.

146
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,080
Leave it for 15 minutes.

147
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,420
Remember,

148
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,780
don't put ice on it.

149
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,300
Or it could be infected.

150
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,460
I wanted to give you on the match day.

151
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
But you might be busy.

152
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,440
So I bring it today.

153
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:15,404
Wow, captain.
You're so hard-working.

154
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,004
It's almost the match day.

155
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:21,284
I have to be prepared.

156
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:33,944
I'm so proud that I chose the right club.

157
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:37,744
You chose well.

158
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,144
I chose you.

159
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,144
I joined this team because of you.

160
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,204
You already told me.

161
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,084
And I thank you.

162
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:52,804
But I want you to stay for the team.

163
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:56,804
Well, I can't go back and change my decision.

164
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:59,384
I really decided to join because of you.

165
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:02,464
Okay.

166
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:05,704
No matter how it started,

167
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,584
you're now a part of the team.

168
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,304
If I'm no longer here,

169
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,224
I want you to stay for the team.

170
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,964
I wanted to give you on the match day.

171
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:37,304
But you might be busy.

172
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,584
So I bring it today.

173
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:41,984
A present from me.

174
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:50,664
Thank you.

175
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,744
Ah...

176
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:09,484
I won't bother you no longer.

177
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:11,304
Do you best!

178
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,364
I'm rooting for you.

179
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,164
Thanks.

180
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:04,204
If you put effort in my job

181
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,804
as much as in what you carry,

182
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:09,844
I'd die peacefully.

183
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:14,224
If I don't carry this,

184
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,904
you won't have nothing else to say?

185
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,464
I just want to warn you,

186
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:25,284
or you'd say that I'm unfair to you.

187
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,284
You have one year till graduation.

188
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:34,404
I suggest you prepare to perform your duty seriously from now on.

189
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:38,244
My duty

190
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,984
is to follow your order?

191
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,224
If you want a real answer,

192
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,764
I'll say

193
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:48,944
Yes.

194
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,664
Then, let me ask again.

195
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:59,964
Do I have freedom to follow my own heart?

196
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:06,344
Duty comes before freedom.

197
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:07,564
Okay?

198
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:15,204
I'm so happy and proud

199
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:19,204
that you are the same old you.

200
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,444
Things never change.

201
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:23,624
I'll excuse myself.

202
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,024
I have to prepare my performance.

203
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,424
Hurry up!

204
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:52,004
Faster!

205
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:35,384
Payoo.

206
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:38,064
I just...

207
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,844
want you to notice me.

208
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,044
I'm noticing you here.

209
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:44,884
Okay?

210
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:12,838
Excellent, my brother.

211
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:16,158
My code-brother too.

212
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:17,978
That's surprising.

213
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:23,998
I won't worry about the promise anymore.

214
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:25,898
Promise?

215
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:28,798
Uh...

216
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:33,638
To take care of the band.

217
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:35,618
Why so nosy?

218
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:42,698
Okay.

219
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,038
I'm happy for you.

220
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,138
You've such a beautiful closure studying here.

221
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,038
Our parents must be proud

222
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:56,418
that your name's engraved on the hall of fame.

223
00:23:57,658 --> 00:23:58,538
Actually,

224
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:03,058
I want to stay longer.

225
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,118
Have you both never talked at home?
Young masters.

226
00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:18,778
Here comes the troublemaker.

227
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,838
Hello, Young Master.

228
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:24,558
There you go again, Tony.

229
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:28,118
My beloved brother.

230
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:29,558
Don't frown like that.

231
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,078
I'm just teasing.

232
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,458
Just call him Kim.

233
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:39,938
Payoo.

234
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:45,738
Payoo.

235
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:50,918
You didn't watch us.

236
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,738
Uh.. Yeah.

237
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:56,938
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,778
I had an errand,
so I just got here.

239
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:04,478
It's okay.

240
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,618
I just...

241
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:11,238
want you to notice me.

242
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:15,458
I'm noticing you here.

243
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:16,298
Okay?

244
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:24,518
Thank you for watching my match.

245
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:28,098
Then,

246
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:31,198
I must excuse myself.

247
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:41,718
Oh.

248
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:45,398
It's your order.
How can I refuse that.

249
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,018
Don't follow my every order.

250
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,918
You're close to her?

251
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:56,418
Uh...

252
00:25:57,278 --> 00:25:58,618
I'll wait for you at the car.

253
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:01,438
No need.

254
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:03,538
I'll go back with Tony.

255
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:07,558
I hope you don't wait.

256
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:10,058
It's an order.

257
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:39,338
That's so you.

258
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,078
Great job, everyone.

259
00:26:52,158 --> 00:26:52,798
Nice work, Toy.

260
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:53,998
Thanks, prof.

261
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:55,638
Sun.

262
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,338
Well done.

263
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:00,558
Thanks for today.

264
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:02,258
Thanks, prof.

265
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,338
Now,

266
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:06,398
time to dismiss.

267
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:08,058
- Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:28,018
Baibua.

269
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,138
What's wrong?

270
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,418
A little.

271
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:36,738
Can you tell me?

272
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:40,758
Not right now.

273
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:45,678
Thank you.

274
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:47,918
For?

275
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:49,838
Uh...

276
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,418
For joining our band.

277
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,438
And...

278
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:56,018
For today's performance.

279
00:27:57,818 --> 00:28:01,998
I should be thanking all of you
for making my dream come true.

280
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:06,258
Oh.

281
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,918
I mean

282
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,098
performing with you all.

283
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:11,838
Okay.

284
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,878
Then, I'll go back to the club.

285
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:18,418
See you tomorrow.

286
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:20,518
Tomorrow?

287
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:22,098
Hey.

288
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,158
You forgot?

289
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:26,818
The camp?

290
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,478
Oh!

291
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:30,098
I remember it.

292
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:31,118
You remember now?

293
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,018
The bus departs at 8 AM.

294
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:34,838
- Okay.
- Don't forget.

295
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:46,898
Forgot something?

296
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:53,198
Forgot a compliment.

297
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:58,398
Today,

298
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,578
you exceeded my expectation.

299
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:02,418
Sun.

300
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,598
You can say nice things now.

301
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:09,778
Why?

302
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:11,138
It's

303
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,118
normal.

304
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:20,698
I'm

305
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,038
that weird?

306
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:32,298
Here.

307
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:41,558
Uh...

308
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:43,698
Nothing's weird.

309
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:45,638
What's with my face?

310
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:10,578
Is he insulting me?

311
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:31,638
Dad.

312
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:41,518
I'm glad you graduated.

313
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,958
You've been waiting just to say that?

314
00:30:49,418 --> 00:30:50,498
I've been waiting

315
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,278
to ask about our promise.

316
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,278
I already fulfilled that since I was born.

317
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:00,138
Don't worry.

318
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:02,958
Good.

319
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,438
Thank you

320
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:09,258
for keeping our promise.

321
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:12,718
I'm the one who should thank you

322
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:15,638
for allowing me to do what I want.

323
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:19,658
I'm tired.

324
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:20,318
Excuse me.

325
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,658
I have two more days of my life

326
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,458
before giving it all to you.

327
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:28,958
I have a camp tomorrow with the university.

328
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:30,338
Bye.

329
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,598
You're about to graduate.

330
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:54,798
Aren't you glad?

331
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:56,478
Or...

332
00:31:57,558 --> 00:31:58,858
You have something to care about?

333
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:31,827
Hey.

334
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:34,427
The party's boring?

335
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,067
Why do you think so?

336
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,167
Because you're here at the pool.

337
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,627
Retreat to your comfort zone.

338
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:47,867
You're about to graduate.

339
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:51,827
Already completed internship.

340
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,067
No need to go to university anymore.

341
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,267
Aren't you glad?

342
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:02,607
Or you don't want to work with dad

343
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:04,387
and me?

344
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,087
Or...

345
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,447
Something to care for?

346
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:19,847
You

347
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:21,947
are good at everything.

348
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:23,707
Know everything.

349
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:27,527
I can never compete with you.

350
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:30,787
No.

351
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:33,667
I'm not good at everything.

352
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,107
I can't win you at everything.

353
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:40,307
There's one thing

354
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,627
that I always lose to you.

355
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,167
Wanna try again?

356
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:56,027
Or you'll say I'm scared to lose.

357
00:33:58,147 --> 00:33:58,827
Sure.

358
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:00,267
Brother.

359
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:20,567
What are you doing?

360
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:25,947
What?

361
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,827
It's a plant.

362
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:33,647
Why?

363
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,127
It's easily scared.

364
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,787
And sensitive.

365
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:39,627
If you scare it,

366
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:42,067
it'll never appear before you again.

367
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:43,567
Really?

368
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:49,847
There it is.

369
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:51,927
How does it live there?

370
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,087
Can it photosynthesize?

371
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:55,467
Yeah.

372
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,647
It can photosynthesize.

373
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,367
Never studied that?

374
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:00,527
I did.

375
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:01,807
At 3rd grade.

376
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,187
What if it can't photosynthesize?

377
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:07,907
There won't be a green color.

378
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:09,647
Um...

379
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,287
Like grandma's gray hair?

380
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:13,647
Yeah, totally gray.

381
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:15,847
Can it grow bigger?

382
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:16,727
I don't think so.

383
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:18,067
Why?

384
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:20,687
It must be itty bitty like me.

385
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:22,387
Beautiful.

386
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:34,447
What are you doing?

387
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:36,967
Don't you like it?

388
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:37,867
Ah huh.

389
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:39,247
Give me your hand.

390
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,967
It's beautiful. Thanks.

391
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:51,887
Ah huh.

392
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,267
What's its name?

393
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,007
There's no name.

394
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:59,607
What should I call it?

395
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:01,687
Kim.

396
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:03,107
Kim.

397
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,047
Kim.

398
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:07,007
Let's have a meal.

399
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,887
I got to go.

400
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:28,227
Thanks, itty bitty.

401
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,487
I heard them around here.

402
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:00,767
Where are they?

403
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:02,147
Yeah.

404
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:04,007
I'll never stop hunting you!

405
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,547
Guys, let's go.

406
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:38,647
They're gone. Don't be scared
when you're with me.

407
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,967
But you aren't always around.

408
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,207
You're scared?

409
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:51,687
Keep this.

410
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:53,887
Your shoes?

411
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:55,107
Yeah.

412
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:56,747
Why?

413
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,467
If someone bullies you again,

414
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,167
show these shoes to them

415
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,667
and say that you have a friend this big.

416
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,487
I bet no one will bully you again.

417
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:07,947
Of course.

418
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,407
With feet this big, body must be big too.

419
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:13,887
No one will dare bully me. Thank you.

420
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,187
Come at me, you big losers!

421
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:19,867
Do you know my friend?!

422
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,627
The Bigfoot!

423
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:25,467
Come!

424
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:33,987
How is my pot? Fit perfectly?

425
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,467
Yeah. Thank you, grandma.

426
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:40,867
I'll be right back.

427
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,207
Hey, Kim.

428
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,747
Wear your shoes properly.

429
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:49,707
Oh.

430
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,647
Are they moving today?

431
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,267
Yes, ma'am.

432
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:02,687
I heard they're moving today.

433
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:03,867
Whole family.

434
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,027
Aw...

435
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,187
Poor Kim.

436
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:14,387
Kim!

437
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:16,647
Goodbye.

438
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:17,467
Itty bitty!

439
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:22,847
Itty bitty!

440
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:24,607
Itty bitty!

441
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:33,567
Itty bitty!

442
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:38,467
Itty bitty!

443
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,287
I'll never forget you.

444
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,807
It can photosynthesize.

445
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:15,487
What if it can't photosynthesize?

446
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,327
There won't be a green color.

447
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:20,807
Itty bitty.

448
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,187
How did you get here?

449
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,167
You dumb.

450
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:46,767
I've been bustling about and forgot to pack my stuff!

451
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:45,287
Do you think I'm that disgusting?

452
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,127
I bet Rain doesn't think so.

453
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,527
Because he doesn't,

454
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,107
that's why he did it.

455
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:57,087
Now's the last game of the night.

456
00:41:57,087 --> 00:42:00,207
The first person you see face to face

457
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,547
will be named your 'soul mate.'

458
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:05,567
Sun, wake up.

459
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:07,847
I wanted to give you on the match day.

460
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:09,707
But you might be busy.

461
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:11,947
So I bring it today.

462
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:17,067
Thank you.

463
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:27,227
I won't bother you no longer.

464
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:29,027
Do you best!

465
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:32,187
I'm rooting for you.

466
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:32,767
Thanks.
