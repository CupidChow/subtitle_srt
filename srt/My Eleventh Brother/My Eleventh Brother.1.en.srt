1
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,833
Can I stay here tonight?

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,458
Sounds good to me!

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,417
What if your mom turns up crying again?

4
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:14,833
I told you to not to talk about it

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,417
I'm just worried

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,208
It was quite shocking

7
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,375
She won't be like that anymore

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,375
Really?

9
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,125
Ah, what  the...

10
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,917
Somebody came home

11
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:28,958
Who?

12
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,000
Fuck

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,833
It's over anyway

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:44,833
Hey

15
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:45,833
What?

16
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,500
Come on baby

17
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,125
Who are you?

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,500
Who the fuck are you?

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,958
I am… Sungkyu

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,458
AN Sungkyu

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,375
Ah… Are you?

22
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,625
Don't lie to me. Lie to my mom instead

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,917
MY ELEVENTH BROTHER

24
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,708
Let's go that way

25
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,500
Why?

26
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,208
AN Sungwoo!

27
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,792
Who is he?

28
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,583
Bye

29
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,583
I asked who he is.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,042
Why is he waiting for you at the door?

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,917
Just a NOBODY

32
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,375
Who are you?

33
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,958
It's my brother

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
Brother? What brother?

35
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,125
My brother, full brother

36
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,917
Go home

37
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,042
You too

38
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,375
Do you have a brother?
You never said that

39
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,542
He had one

40
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,125
And now, too

41
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,708
Bullshit

42
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,792
Bye

43
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,208
Is he your friend?

44
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,750
Did you stay at his home yesterday?

45
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,000
You should've called

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,792
Mother was worried about you so much

47
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,792
My brother didn't call mom
as ‘mother'

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,875
And you didn't act like this
to your brother, either

49
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,917
Don't be pretending like
you are my brother

50
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,208
You are just fake. Aren't you?

51
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,083
I want to stay at this house forever

52
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:11,958
What?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,333
If you tell your parents,

54
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,708
I'll tell them that you're gay.

55
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,667
I don't care

56
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,792
How did you know?

57
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:39,917
What?

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,292
WHAT?

59
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,667
How I knew is not important

60
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,750
The important thing is that
I know about you

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,208
You know nothing about me

62
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,792
Mom

63
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,833
Are you mad at me?

64
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,917
Sorry. I'll never do that again

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,917
(Confirmation of adoption)
LIM Jihoon…

66
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,500
No, now, his name is AN Sungkyu

67
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,333
I think, THIS Sungkyu
is different from other boys

68
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,375
Do you agree?

69
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,625
He is the eleventh kid

70
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,417
You know Joseph?

71
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,750
He is the eleventh son of Jacob

72
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,625
Dad

73
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,917
It's been a long time

74
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,417
I know

75
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,917
How is your mom?

76
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,292
Is she OK?

77
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,583
Yes

78
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,667
She will always be OK

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,875
because my brother has come home

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,250
It's a good thing

81
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,417
So now can you come back too?

82
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:43,125
You promised to live together
when mom is well

83
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:53,333
You are still a little boy

84
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,708
When you grow up,

85
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,500
you will understand me

86
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,958
You know what I mean?

87
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,792
Your spoon is too small!

88
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:38,792
My son has all grown up now

89
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:46,167
My son, how did you grow up so well
without me?

90
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,458
I can't even recognize you

91
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
Who are you?

92
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm so happy that we've
all together for 10 years

93
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,125
Darling, how about you?

94
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:29,083
I'm happy, too.

95
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,083
I'm so happy

96
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,250
to see you happy.

97
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,917
Thanks, darling

98
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,042
I'm so happy.

99
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,083
We will be happy

100
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,542
We will be happy all together forever

101
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,083
Let's start eating

102
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,292
Steaks are getting cold

103
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,417
Sungwoo, Sungkyu,

104
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,292
Enjoy your meal

105
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,000
It's delicious, mom

106
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,625
Sungkyu, what about you?

107
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,833
How do you like it?

108
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,417
It's delicious

109
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,125
Mom

110
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,417
I looked into some news of the boys
you used to hang out with…

111
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,250
Pardon?

112
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,625
You want to hear about them?

113
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,417
No

114
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,625
Be smart

115
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,000
Everything depends on you

116
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,667
If you are in trouble,

117
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,083
ask Sungwoo for help.

118
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,708
Bye, Sungwoo

119
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,708
Call me if anything comes up

120
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,833
What a jerk!

121
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,750
It works quit well.
If not, however,

122
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
take these two

123
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:37,792
Thanks

124
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,333
Is it good?

125
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,792
Yes. What's wrong?

126
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,583
I'm just happy looking at you

127
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,208
Then I'll keep making you happy

128
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,625
You're too kind,

129
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,875
not like usual

130
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,458
I'm always kind

131
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,375
Be honest with me

132
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,583
Did you feel sorry to me these days?

133
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,792
Yes, I did

134
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,000
Then, tell me

135
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Tell you about what?

136
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,167
Everything. Confess to me

137
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,792
About what?

138
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,542
Like.. I love you?

139
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,167
No kidding

140
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,458
Why don't you tell me about yourself?

141
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,333
I always tell you about me

142
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,625
No, you don't

143
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,542
It's only me
who talks about everything.

144
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:49,167
How can I think about you
if I know nothing about you?

145
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,292
Jaemin

146
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,542
Do you really want to know about me?

147
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,542
Yes

148
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,208
You promise you won't leave me

149
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,167
whatever I'm like

150
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,333
I promise

151
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,875
Really?  -Yes

152
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,875
What are you doing?

153
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,167
Don't do that

154
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,958
Just tell me

155
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,417
Fuck! What's your problem?

156
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,875
What do you mean?

157
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,667
Piss off

158
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,625
Why?

159
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,333
Fuck off!

160
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Who do you think you are?

161
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,500
They are mommy bird and baby bird

162
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,667
Let me go

163
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,667
Where are you going?

164
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,208
None of your business

165
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,625
Why are you staying?

166
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,792
You know, my family has gone mad

167
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm not gonna leave

168
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,417
I will be here forever

169
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,292
I was always afraid that

170
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
other people would find out about me

171
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,292
But now,

172
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,625
I don't even know who I am

173
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,708
Who are you?

174
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,667
Me?

175
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,250
I am nobody

176
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,542
Mom, see you

177
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,792
Sungwoo, say bye to your brother

178
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:36,958
Yes

179
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,000
Sungkyu, see you

180
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,167
Have a nice day

181
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:10,542
MY ELEVENTH BROTHER
