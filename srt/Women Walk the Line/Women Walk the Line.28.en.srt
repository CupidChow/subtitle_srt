1
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,239
Long time no see.

2
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,519
Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu is back.

3
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,799
Here, sit here.

4
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
No, no, no. Zhang Wei,

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,319
I haven't been here for a long time.

6
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,239
I don't know anything.

7
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,359
No. Sit down. Sit down.

8
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
This is your seat.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,719
-It's okay. -Sit down. Let

10
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,879
me hear it.

11
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,640
Mr. Liu,

12
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,280
you're back to work so soon,

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Your child is so young,

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,439
can you leave her alone?

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,640
My daughter is very good.

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,760
She doesn't like to cry,

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Don't worry.

18
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,039
My daughter is good,

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
that brat in our house,

20
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
At that time, I told you,

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,719
crying all night,

22
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,759
My hair is standing.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,639
It's horrible.

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,360
Everyone is here,

25
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,199
Mr. Fu.

26
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:15,919
Hello,

27
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,759
Mr. Fu.

28
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,639
Welcome back.

29
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,719
You're back.

30
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,120
Mr. Liu,

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
how is it?

32
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,319
How are you?

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,319
I'm recovering well.

34
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,520
That's good.

36
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,080
That's right, Zhang Wei,

37
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,759
Mr. Liu just came back,

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,159
and so many things have happened

39
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,360
in our company recently,

40
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,840
She needs some time, too.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,479
To get familiar with it,

42
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,280
so you should pay more attention to it.

43
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,560
Don't worry.

44
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,120
Okay,

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Let's get started.

46
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,479
Mr. Du,

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,080
tell everyone,

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,400
What do you think of Li Meng's

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
recent listing data?

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Amazing.

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,319
The repurchase rate

52
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,719
reached 56% this month.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,680
It means that the user

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,639
is very satisfied

55
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,199
with Li Meng's products.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
That's good.

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,919
How is the new product development

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,039
of our product department

59
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,840
going in the first quarter?

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,599
New product development

61
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
is still in progress.

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,960
If everything goes well,

63
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,120
by the end of next month,

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
It should be able to do internal testing.

65
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,639
Very good.

66
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
And Gezi,

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
Bai Xue's

68
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,759
plagiarism,

69
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,840
It's almost over.

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,560
Mr. Wang

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
is still dragging his feet

72
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,439
and refuses to terminate this contract.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,719
if

74
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,680
He doesn't want to return the first payment.

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,159
Should we

76
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,199
continue to work with him?

77
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,400
If we stop,

78
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,439
our money

79
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,479
will really be wasted.

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,719
Mr. Fu,

81
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,000
I suggest we wait a little longer.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,759
After all, the Internet has memories,

83
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,360
so we can't give our competitors

84
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,360
any opportunities

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,639
at this time.

86
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,639
Okay,

87
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,599
As long as you know what to do.

88
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,719
Okay,

89
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,560
Let's move on to the next project.

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,919
Mr. Fu,

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
I heard that Li Meng's sales volume

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,680
has reached a new high,

93
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,159
The user's stickiness is also very good.

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,479
Thank you, Mr. Xiong,

95
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,840
for this achievement,

96
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Mr. Fu is a good coach

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
and has a unique vision,

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,319
Are you working?

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,039
Steady, accurate and ruthless.

100
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,039
Step on the spot every step of the way.

101
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
Or did you do a good job in promotion?

102
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,800
Thank you.

103
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,160
Mr. Xiong,

104
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,519
David.

105
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,600
Mr. Fu,

106
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,279
let me introduce you to a friend.

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,439
This is David from Borai Group.

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
Originally,

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,639
he was the president

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,399
of Greater China,

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
I just got back to the headquarters,

112
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,279
David,

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,920
This is Mr. Fu from Shumei,

114
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,360
Mr. Fu,

115
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,240
I've heard a lot about you.

116
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,680
You're the private entrepreneur

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,600
we admire the most,

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,519
I don't dare to.

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,319
You're welcome.

120
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
You definitely deserve this title.

121
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,199
We bought you

122
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,040
into Li Juncheng,

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
And quickly occupy

124
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,800
the high-end skin care market,

125
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,600
Learn it as a success story.

126
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,879
You're being serious.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Thank you.

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,079
You're welcome.

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Sit down and talk.

130
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm going to make a phone call.

131
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
Okay, see you later.

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,240
See you later.

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Okay,

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,800
Please have a seat.

135
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,480
Please.

136
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,079
Mr. Fu,

137
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,079
you're so presumptuous,

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,279
I came to disturb you

139
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,079
while you were playing basketball.

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,120
But I've been

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
begging Mr. Xiong for a long time.

142
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,879
I hope he can arrange a chance.

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,959
-Let me see you. -No

144
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,360
problem.

145
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,519
Mr. Xiong's friend

146
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,680
is my friend.

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,000
Would you like something to drink?

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
Coffee,

149
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,240
Okay.

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Mr. Fu,

151
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,720
I was on my way here,

152
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,079
My driver told me

153
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,480
a very interesting story,

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,759
-Another cup of

155
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,319
coffee. -Okay,

156
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,279
Mr. Fu,

157
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,519
would you like to hear it?

158
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,519
Okay.

159
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
He said there was an old blacksmith,

160
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,600
who brought two disciples at the same time,

161
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,199
He hopes that both of them

162
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,240
can become masters.

163
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,519
First apprentice,

164
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,759
I've been with him for the longest time.

165
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
The second apprentice is very smart.

166
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,839
He knows how to learn.

167
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,199
But Mr. Fu knows that

168
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,680
people's energy and time

169
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,439
are limited.

170
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,240
Unfortunately,

171
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,160
until the old blacksmith died,

172
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,279
It's a pity that both apprentices haven't completed

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,439
their studies yet, right?

174
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,560
Mr. Fu,

175
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,800
you said that

176
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,920
if the old blacksmith had focused more

177
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,560
on the clever Second Disciple.

178
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,800
The Second Disciple,

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,160
should have become a master long time ago.

180
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,040
David,

181
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,879
why don't we

182
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,319
get straight to the point.

183
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,399
Mr. Fu,

184
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,199
I heard that Shumei

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,879
is having a problem with fake goods,

186
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,079
But also got involved

187
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,519
in copyright plagiarism,

188
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
I didn't mean that.

189
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
Mr. Fu is not an old blacksmith,

190
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,800
he has enough energy

191
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,439
and time,

192
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,879
You can bring two apprentices at the same time,

193
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,319
but the reputation of the first apprentice

194
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,360
has been ruined.

195
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,839
It will definitely affect

196
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,800
Master's reputation.

197
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,879
and

198
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,399
It will also affect the reputation of Second Disciple.

199
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,120
Are you trying to persuade me to give up Shumei?

200
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,680
Mr. Fu,

201
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,240
let me be honest,

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Now that Li Meng is in the ascendancy,

203
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,000
why doesn't Mr. Fu

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,079
focus more

205
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,360
on Li Meng,

206
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,279
who has a bright future?

207
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,519
Our Baolai Group is very sincere.

208
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
He wants to buy Shumei.

209
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,240
Mr. Fu, you can think about it,

210
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
our Baolai Group,

211
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,279
You must show the highest sincerity.

212
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,399
Sir, your coffee.

213
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,079
Enjoy your meal.

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,759
Thank you.

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,399
Hey,

216
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,960
Hey, Wang Mei,

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,039
did you see my photo frame

218
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,120
and one of my earrings?

219
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,000
No.

220
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,399
When I went out this morning,

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,759
I thought it was still

222
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,399
on your bedside table, right?

223
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,919
But when I come back now,

224
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,919
it's gone.

225
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,120
Is there a thief in the house?

226
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,919
Look for it again.

227
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,879
Did you lose

228
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,879
anything valuable,

229
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,519
Call the police if there is one.

230
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,000
Me,

231
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm outside right now.

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
I can't go back either.

233
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,919
It's okay. Go ahead with your work.

234
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,919
Sorry,

235
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,759
I didn't see the name clearly.

236
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,440
I thought it was mine.

237
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,759
Come in,

238
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,840
Did you touch my stuff again?

239
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,720
Give me back

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
my earrings. I was broadcasting live just now,

241
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,679
Let me borrow it.

242
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,120
Borrow it?

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,799
I'm not even here. What do you mean by borrowing it?

244
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,559
What do you mean?

245
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,519
You can't say that

246
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,440
I stole from you, can you?

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
It's not like I won't pay you back.

248
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,399
Here you go. Here you go.

249
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,480
In the future,

250
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,679
what do you want to use?

251
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,679
Feel free to pick it up.

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,399
Please respect

253
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,360
each other's privacy in the future,

254
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,480
Gu Qiao,

255
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,360
it's boring to say that.

256
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,360
Give me back my bag

257
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,759
and the lipstick

258
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,440
I lent you last time.

259
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,720
Here you go. Here you go.

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,519
I'll give them all to you.

261
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,879
Gosh,

262
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,519
guarding against neighbors is like guarding against thieves.

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't share it if you have the ability.

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,919
Where are my photos?

265
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,279
What photo?

266
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Didn't you move the photo

267
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,120
I put on the bed?

268
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,480
Why would I take your picture?

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
I'm useless.

270
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,519
Are you sure?

271
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,639
I'm sure.

272
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,240
What are you doing?

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
What are you doing?

274
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,559
You've gone too far.

275
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,799
Isn't it just a photo frame?

276
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,960
It's not gilt-edged,

277
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
so I can compensate you for one, right?

278
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,919
If I didn't ask you,

279
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,919
it would be over, right?

280
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,960
Do you know how important

281
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,480
this photo is to me?

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,519
Isn't it just a photo?

283
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,559
It's not a photo.

284
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,080
What are you doing?

285
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
How dare you hit me?

286
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,000
What's wrong if I hit you?

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,799
How dare you hit me?

288
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,600
If you touch my stuff again,

289
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,279
how dare you hit me?

290
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,279
I've had enough of you.

291
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,759
How dare you bonus hunting my hair?

292
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,679
I don't have much hair,

293
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,840
so what's wrong with my bonus hunting?

294
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,799
It's you.

295
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,519
You threw away my photo first.

296
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,759
Tell me.

297
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,879
Who started it first?

298
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,320
She,

299
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,919
She slapped me in the face,

300
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
police officer,

301
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,559
Look, my face is swollen.

302
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,840
You had too much hyaluronic acid.

303
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
Why did you hit her?

304
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,720
She stole from me

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,759
and broke my stuff,

306
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,759
You even hurt me.

307
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,639
Make it clear.

308
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,399
What do you mean by stealing?

309
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,759
That stupid thing of yours.

310
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,720
Who cares?

311
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,320
I accidentally broke it.

312
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,679
Isn't it stealing if you don't ask yourself?

313
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,799
Didn't your parents teach you?

314
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,799
Officer,

315
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,960
not only did she insult me for stealing,

316
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,519
She insulted my parents.

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,159
Stop crying.

318
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,480
As neighbors,

319
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,759
I don't know how to tolerate each other,

320
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
You fought at home in the middle of the night,

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,559
affecting others.

322
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

323
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
She hit me first.

324
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,000
This is already

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,240
a crime of personal injury, right?

326
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,039
I need an examination.

327
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,799
I want to sue her.

328
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,720
You're done, aren't you?

329
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,000
You're wrong.

330
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,799
Don't you know?

331
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,320
In my opinion, you two

332
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,039
are fine.

333
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,840
Take a step back.

334
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,879
We should acknowledge each other's mistakes,

335
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,519
but,

336
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
But what?

337
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,799
You don't want to settle down, do you?

338
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,879
Then let's follow

339
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,559
the legal procedure,

340
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,679
It's time to detain him.

341
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,159
No,

342
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,200
Sir,

343
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,799
I … I was wrong.

344
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,120
I apologize, okay?

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,919
I'm sorry,

346
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,480
Gu Qiao,

347
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,600
I was wrong.

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
I shouldn't have thrown away your picture.

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm afraid you'll get angry when you know it.

350
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,279
I was confused for a moment.

351
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,679
I won't do this again.

352
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,440
What about you?

353
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm sorry.

354
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,679
Come on,

355
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,080
Call your family

356
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,759
and get them.

357
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,159
It's done.

358
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,879
All right,

359
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,519
You can leave now.

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,639
-Okay. -Thank you.

361
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,720
Your best friend hasn't called back.

362
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
Do you have any other friends?

363
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,720
Can you lend me your phone?

364
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,559
Thank you.

365
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,200
Have a cup of hot milk

366
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,879
and relax.

367
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,519
This is the first time

368
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,080
I went to the police station in my life,

369
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,080
There's always a first time for everything.

370
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,639
Drink the milk.

371
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,039
Go to bed early.

372
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,399
When I wake up tomorrow,

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,159
everything will be over.

374
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,559
Gu Qiao,

375
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,399
wait for me.

376
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,320
Are you okay?

377
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,320
It's okay.

378
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,759
I just called you,

379
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,639
Why didn't you hear me?

380
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,159
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,360
Your dress today,

382
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,039
it doesn't look like your usual style.

383
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,039
What's wrong?

384
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,559
You're in a bad mood early in the morning.

385
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,240
No.

386
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,240
What did you do last night?

387
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,320
I was at home yesterday.

388
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,720
I went to bed early.

389
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,759
It's not that early, is it?

390
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,440
What's wrong?

391
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,559
I'm fine.

392
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,839
Wang Mei, why are you late again?

393
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,359
-Mobile phone. -Thank

394
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,599
you.

395
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,279
You quarreled

396
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,119
with Xu Ling'er.

397
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,079
She said it more than once

398
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,160
when she went back,

399
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,400
Of course I won't listen to her.

400
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,240
but

401
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
What's going on?

402
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,839
You didn't take your phone, either.

403
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,960
I didn't go back to live yesterday.

404
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Where did you live?

405
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,640
Your dress looks nice.

406
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,960
But unlike Mr. Yuan's,

407
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,519
I'm in Shanghai,

408
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,599
She's not the only friend.

409
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,119
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,720
The longer you get along with each other

411
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,599
like wine,

412
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,839
The more you like it.

413
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,519
Come on!

414
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,720
Get back to work.

415
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,039
Hello,

416
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Mr. Fu. Mr. Xiong is here too.

417
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
Mr. Yuan, long time no see.

418
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,599
Long time no see,

419
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Mr. Fu,

420
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,839
What do you want to see me for?

421
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,039
Actually, it's nothing.

422
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,279
It's just recently,

423
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,039
I have a friend who has something to do.

424
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,799
You want to ask me for help?

425
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Then I want to tell you,

426
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,640
so that you can make an idea for me.

427
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,160
Well,

428
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,279
I have an old friend.

429
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,599
Those who do business in Beijing,

430
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
just like us,

431
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,839
It's also a local brand.

432
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,279
Recently,

433
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,039
There is

434
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,079
Foreign capital

435
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,799
wanted to buy their company,

436
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,160
So,

437
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,119
do you think this is a good thing?

438
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,880
What company is it?

439
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How is the scale?

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
What is the purpose

441
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,279
of this foreign capital's

442
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:39,920
acquisition of it?

443
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,720
As for the details,

444
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,759
I don't quite understand

445
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,680
his company's size

446
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,960
is about the same as Shumei's.

447
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,519
For example,

448
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,000
if you have

449
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,680
a foreign capital now,

450
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,039
If you want to buy our company,

451
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,519
will you approve of it?

452
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,359
Mr. Fu,

453
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,079
in fact, there are precedents

454
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,240
for foreign capital

455
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,519
to acquire local brands.

456
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,839
But most of those companies

457
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,319
later lost their popularity,

458
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,960
Gradually forgotten by the market,

459
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,039
for example,

460
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,440
The Golden Monkey acquired by Haoli Company,

461
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,839
the original purpose of Haoli Company's

462
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,839
acquisition of Golden Monkey,

463
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,680
in order to monopolize

464
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,839
the candy market in China,

465
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
What about Golden Monkey after it was acquired?

466
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,160
It wasn't long before it was hidden in the snow.

467
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,920
And,

468
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,599
like us,

469
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,240
The little doctor who made skin care products,

470
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,559
after the little doctor

471
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,160
was acquired by Laiya Group,

472
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
Laiya Group,

473
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,279
using the channel of a little doctor,

474
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,680
We're developing our own product line,

475
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,440
so the number of doctors

476
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
is gradually declining.

477
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,000
Here's the thing,

478
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,480
Mr. Fu,

479
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,519
Actually, I think

480
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,920
it's a good time for domestic brands

481
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,200
to develop.

482
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,880
If it wasn't because of the shortage of funds,

483
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,240
or because of

484
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,279
some unavoidable difficulties.

485
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,359
I don't think it's necessary to sell it.

486
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,519
After all, it takes a lot of effort

487
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,599
to cultivate a brand.

488
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,920
You still have energy.

489
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,279
Mr. Xiong,

490
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:13,920
listen,

491
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,319
Ge Zi,

492
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,440
though young,

493
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,559
But in fact, she knows

494
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,440
as much as I do.

495
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,759
Yeah,

496
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,960
looks like I need to

497
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,680
ask my friend out,

498
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,799
Play one more game,

499
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,960
and have a good chat with him.

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,759
Ge Zi, if you're busy,

501
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,640
Go back to your work.

502
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll get going then.

503
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:40,640
Okay,

504
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,079
Mr. Xiong,

505
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,960
excuse me.

506
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
No wonder people say that

507
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,960
Shumei's boss,

508
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,359
Although it's Mr. Fu,

509
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,720
But

510
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,440
The right to speak seems to be

511
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,400
in the hands of Vice President Yuan,

512
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,839
That's not what it says.

513
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,640
Governing a big country is like cooking a little fresh food,

514
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
Knowing people and employing people,

515
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,720
is the most important way

516
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,480
for me, Fu Mei, to win.

517
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,079
I listen to Yuan Ge so much,

518
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,519
because I know,

519
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,599
She cares more about Shumei

520
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,079
than she cares about herself.

521
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,039
The tea is getting cold.

522
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,920
Why don't you come to my office,

523
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,920
and I'll make you a cup of good tea.

524
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,319
Okay.

525
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,960
Gu Qiao,

526
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
Mr. Xiong, why are you here?

527
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,799
I happen to be here

528
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,039
to talk to Mr. Fu about something,

529
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,279
I'll drop you off.

530
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
No, thanks.

531
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,400
It's very convenient for me to go back by bus.

532
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,480
It's not a big deal.

533
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,319
Let's go.

534
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Mr. Xiong said it's no trouble.

535
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,319
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

536
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,720
Thank you.

537
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,839
What big client is so mysterious?

538
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
We'll find out soon.

539
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,799
It seems to be this person.

540
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,039
But I'm not sure.

541
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,440
Hao Shuai.

542
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,519
Hao Shuai.

543
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,480
Long time no see.

544
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,440
Good evening,

545
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,599
Miss Yuan,

546
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,480
call me sister-in-law.

547
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,799
Sister-in-law,

548
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,880
Hao Shuai,

549
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,240
I didn't even recognize you

550
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,359
when you were dressed like this.

551
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,079
Mr. Du,

552
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,559
you're three minutes and fifteen seconds late.

553
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,839
Punctuality is the basic quality

554
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,559
of successful people,

555
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,799
I learned a lot when I went out.

556
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,160
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

557
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,640
Come on,

558
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,839
Let me introduce to you,

559
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
this is not the original Hao Shuai

560
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
I can tell.

561
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,519
He is now an assistant to

562
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,000
the investment president of Tomato Company,

563
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,599
Sister-in-law,

564
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,720
although I'm an assistant now,

565
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,920
But my clients are all engaged

566
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
in big projects,

567
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,680
If you want to buy a company,

568
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,319
or sell a company,

569
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,079
You can come to me.

570
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,839
I'll take care of it for you.

571
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,799
The cow blew it a little too big.

572
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,319
Brother,

573
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,480
You can't look at me in the same way.

574
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,960
You have to

575
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,440
look at me

576
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,640
from the perspective of developing the future. It makes sense. When I grow up,

577
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,640
Hao Shuai has grown up.

578
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,720
You guys talk for a while.

579
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,559
I'll go order.

580
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,039
Sister-in-law,

581
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,039
how is Ms. Gu recently?

582
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,400
Ms. Gu,

583
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,599
Gu Qiao,

584
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:42,759
Yes.

585
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,359
It's Ms. Gu Qiao Gu.

586
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
How is she recently?

587
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,599
It's okay,

588
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,559
Well,

589
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,680
In a couple of days,

590
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,759
if you're free,

591
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,799
Let me treat you to dinner.

592
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,880
Okay.

593
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Let's go.

594
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Isn't this the rich guy from the other day?

595
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,599
She didn't come home for the night. She's staying

596
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,440
in someone else's house.

597
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,119
You're making rapid progress.

598
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,000
What are you talking about?

599
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,160
Keep your mouth clean.

600
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,559
Am I wrong?

601
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,119
When and when you say it again,

602
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,319
just,

603
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,279
Xu Ling'er,

604
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,000
don't go too far.

605
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,799
Gu Qiao is tolerant

606
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,759
enough of you.

607
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,680
Gu Qiao,

608
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,880
don't argue with her.

609
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,720
She's just like that,

610
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,880
Mr. Xiong,

611
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
Thank you for sending us back.

612
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,480
I'll go upstairs now.

613
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,079
You guys have a chat.

614
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,319
Gu Qiao,

615
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,799
I don't think it's necessary for you.

616
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,559
Qu is right here.

617
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,400
Move in with me.

618
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,079
No offense.

619
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,519
I think you have to go to work,

620
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,680
and you have to spend time with Ling Ling,

621
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,440
There's really no need to

622
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,559
be angry with such a person.

623
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,680
Besides, I have

624
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,720
an empty room in my house,

625
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,240
If you don't mind,

626
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,920
thank you.

627
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,039
I can

628
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,759
handle this.

629
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,119
All right,

630
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,640
go to bed early.

631
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll go in first.

632
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,920
Goodbye.

633
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:36,640
Goodbye.

634
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,799
You're back.

635
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,400
I went to my classmate's house for dinner yesterday.

636
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,079
It ended late.

637
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll just live there.

638
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,920
If I were at home,

639
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,480
Xu Ling'er,

640
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,680
I wouldn't dare to do this to you.

641
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,519
It's okay.

642
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Anyway,

643
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,640
She didn't take advantage of anything.

644
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
Gu Qiao,

645
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,880
you and Mr. Yuan,

646
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,319
Didn't we make up?

647
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,759
Why didn't you think about moving back in?

648
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,920
Actually, when I moved out,

649
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,599
it wasn't all because I was angry with her.

650
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
I want to be on my own,

651
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,640
just like you.

652
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,319
I understand you.

653
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,720
By the way,

654
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,319
About my fight,

655
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,680
don't tell her.

656
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,519
Don't worry. I won't tell you.

657
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,160
Did I

658
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,279
make you angry recently?

659
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,680
No.

660
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,640
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

661
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,160
Wang,

662
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
did something happen to

663
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Gu Qiao recently?

664
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,640
I'm fine.

665
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,119
I'm not.

666
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,319
Gu Qiao didn't allow me to tell you.

667
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,119
No, no, no.

668
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:01,960
Mr. Yuan,

669
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,680
Then.

670
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,839
I'm telling you,

671
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,759
don't say it's me.

672
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,480
We're the only ones who share it.

673
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,400
There was a girl named Xu Ling'er,

674
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
and Gu Qiao got into a fight with her

675
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,559
for some unknown reason.

676
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,119
They even went to the police station.

677
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,799
And then?

678
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,079
And she didn't come home

679
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,160
that night.

680
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,279
Hey,

681
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,119
Hello Ms. Gu,

682
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,799
Zhangjiang Hi-Tech has

683
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,440
a very cost-effective waiter nearby,

684
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,200
I can't afford it.

685
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,200
I said I'll buy it. No,

686
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,079
it's me. It's me.

687
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,680
Hao Shuai,

688
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,599
Hao Shuai,

689
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,480
Long time no see.

690
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,279
Did you miss me?

691
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,079
I miss you so much.

692
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,240
Why are you calling me at this point?

693
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,440
Didn't my brother tell my sister-in-law

694
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,680
that I went back to China?

695
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,319
You're back.

696
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,799
You're in trouble again.

697
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,279
What kind of trouble

698
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,119
did I cause?

699
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,599
I came back seriously

700
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,720
this time,

701
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,319
And now I'm working

702
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,680
in a great company,

703
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,960
Congratulations.

704
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,880
Are you free tonight?

705
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,759
I'll treat you to a meal.

706
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm busy.

707
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,720
Don't you think this is too boring?

708
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,559
Well,

709
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,279
when your brother and sister-in-law

710
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,440
have time, let's eat together.

711
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,720
I've been working all day and I'm exhausted.

712
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,720
I won't say goodbye.

713
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,240
It's not … Hey, hey,

714
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,839
Hello.

715
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,839
Tell me,

716
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,240
how should I help Gu Qiao

717
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,880
celebrate her birthday this year?

718
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,319
How did you celebrate it before?

719
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,359
When she was in school,

720
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,720
I used to take her to eat delicious food.

721
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,039
Then blow out the candles with her.

722
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
After she went back to her hometown,

723
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,200
I gave her gifts regularly

724
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
and regularly every year,

725
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Send a birthday wish.

726
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,720
Let's do it this year.

727
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,319
No way.

728
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,920
I made her angry recently.

729
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,680
I want to take advantage of this birthday,

730
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,160
to make it up to her.

731
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
Don't you usually have a lot of ideas?

732
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,759
Help me think about it.

733
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,119
Since you need me so much,

734
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll help you think about it.

735
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,240
This year,

736
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,880
give her some counter-tricks,

737
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,839
How to go against the routine?

738
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,400
You see,

739
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,240
she used to celebrate her birthday every year,

740
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,400
You gave it to her, didn't you?

741
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,759
I forgot

742
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,759
this year. Today is your birthday?

743
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,319
I was so busy at work

744
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,119
that I forgot,

745
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,720
I forgot. I forgot.

746
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,920
Keep her expectations

747
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,759
to a minimum.

748
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,799
In the end,

749
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,720
give her

750
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,720
a big birthday surprise party.

751
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,400
How should she be angry before?

752
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,279
No matter how angry you are.

753
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,000
By this point,

754
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,599
I'm sure you'll be moved to pieces.

755
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,640
Everything is gone.

756
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,319
By the way,

757
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,880
why are you two angry?

758
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,240
As for girls,

759
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,640
don't ask about it.

760
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,920
When I was angry,

761
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,799
I didn't see you

762
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,279
trying so hard to coax me,

763
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,680
Wait.

764
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,880
Do you think this idea is reliable?

765
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,559
Then.

766
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,720
What if

767
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,519
she's really anxious?

768
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,279
Besides,

769
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,440
it's not like Gu Qiao doesn't know,

770
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,400
No matter how busy I am every year,

771
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,759
I won't forget her birthday.

772
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,559
This year is different.

773
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,920
What's the difference?

774
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
You have a boyfriend this year?

775
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
What should I do?

776
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,759
Can you eat first?

777
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,400
Let's talk after eating.

778
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,599
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

779
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,319
Eat it.

780
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
When you go to the company today,

781
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,759
you must

782
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,799
hold it tight.

783
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,839
Don't expose yourself.

784
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,759
I know.

785
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,079
At worst, I won't look at her.

786
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,359
Yes, that's it.

787
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,200
You're good at this.

788
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,039
By the way,

789
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,839
I have to leave early this afternoon.

790
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm going to make a cake

791
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
for Gu Qiao myself.

792
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,920
No problem.

793
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,519
Leave the rest to me.

794
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,519
I'll deliver her to her destination on time.

795
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
See you at the office later.

796
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,759
See you later.

797
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,319
Brother,

798
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,200
Lend me a suit.

799
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Don't you have one?

800
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,200
I can't wear

801
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,079
that outfit all the time.

802
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,200
It's in the closet.

803
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,880
Help yourself.

804
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,440
What are you doing tonight?

805
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,640
evening

806
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,079
Eat with the leader. Work

807
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,559
is important.

808
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,400
Go ahead.

809
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,880
Qiao,

810
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
today is your birthday.

811
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,279
Happy birthday, Dad!

812
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,799
Good health

813
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,359
and happy every day.

814
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,119
During this period of time,

815
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,519
I've been blaming myself.

816
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,079
I'm useless.

817
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,359
I failed to give you and your brother

818
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,720
a better life.

819
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,480
I shouldn't, shouldn't,

820
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,039
shouldn't have

821
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,440
bought a house for your brother,

822
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,079
He secretly went to borrow money from Luan's family.

823
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,960
I dragged you down, too.

824
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,320
Director Yuan said that

825
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,000
you are doing well in Shanghai now,

826
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,199
I feel much more at ease.

827
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
Take good care of yourself.

828
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,679
You don't have to

829
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,320
worry about family matters.

830
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,039
This is Li Meng's

831
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,440
brand activity report for this month,

832
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,440
Put it there.

833
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,199
I'll read it later.

834
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,760
Why don't you watch it now?

835
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,440
What's the problem?

836
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,719
You can point it out in time,

837
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
I'll really read it later,

838
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,599
I'll tell you if there's a problem,

839
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,440
You.

840
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,800
Didn't Ge Ge

841
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
tell you about me?

842
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,800
What do you mean?

843
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,679
Wang Mei,

844
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
tonight,

845
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,400
Do you have time?

846
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,480
What are you doing?

847
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,280
Call Xia Meng and Fan Fan.

848
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Let's have dinner together.

849
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,480
It's on me.

850
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,559
I can't.

851
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,880
I had an appointment last week.

852
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,320
Xia Meng,

853
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,440
are you free?

854
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,960
I'm going on a blind date.

855
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,519
You can ask Fan Fan out,

856
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,480
-She must be free. -Hello, Fan

857
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,159
Fan. Are you free tonight?

858
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,960
Let's eat together.

859
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,400
Looks like Fan Fan is going to be with her boyfriend.

860
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
What is it?

861
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,599
Do you have anything to do tonight?

862
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,480
Let's have dinner

863
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,000
together. Not today.

864
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,599
I have an appointment with a client

865
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,039
tonight. I'm running out of time.

866
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,599
Goodbye.

867
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,440
Maybe tomorrow.

868
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,079
Miss Gu Qiao, we're leaving.

869
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,079
Goodbye.

870
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:39,559
Let's go.

871
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
You're not off duty yet.

872
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,039
just right

873
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,280
He accompanied me to meet a client tonight,

874
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,159
but insisted on meeting a client tonight,

875
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,559
It's very important.

876
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,400
It's hard to make an appointment.

877
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm free today.

878
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,440
See you later.

879
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,880
Didn't you say you'd take me to meet a client?

880
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,320
Where is she?

881
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,400
That's right.

882
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,239
Where is she?

883
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,559
I'll look for it.

884
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,880
Happy birthday to you!

885
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,159
Happy birthday to you!

886
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,880
Happy birthday to you!

887
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,639
Happy birthday to you!

888
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,920
Happy birthday,

889
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,159
Gu Qiao! Happy birthday!

890
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,840
Happy birthday to you!

891
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,920
Say it was your idea.

892
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,719
Are you happy?

893
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,480
Are you touched?

894
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,000
Do you still want to cry?

895
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,440
Gu Qiao.

896
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,360
I want to sincerely

897
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,440
apologize to you.

898
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,320
I did something wrong

899
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,880
before. Forgive me, will you?

900
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,079
Make a wish.

901
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,119
Come and make a wish.

902
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,679
Make a wish.

903
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,320
Make a wish. Be happy every day.

904
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,199
Du Bingwen,

905
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,360
pick up the phone,

906
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,039
The number you dialed?

907
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,559
There's no answer for now.

908
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,760
I'm sorry

909

for the number you dialed,

Why do you want to see me?

915
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,599
Where are you?

I'm with my friends.

It's your birthday.

918
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,599
If you don't have
