1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,480
18million,

2
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,159
they're talking

3
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,400
like 1. 8thousand.

4
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,239
Master,

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,359
especially Du Bingwen,

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,879
How dare he use Mr. Fu to suppress you.

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,879
He must have gotten a kickback.

8
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,319
You don't know the way

9
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,560
he looked at Maggie back then,

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,719
There must be something going on between them.

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,599
I asked you to assist Du Bingwen.

12
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm not asking you to gossip,

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,159
instead of making rumors here,

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,319
Why don't you think about

15
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,040
what I just heard?

16
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,959
What gossip?

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
What gossip?

18
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,519
Master, I'm leaving.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What gossip?

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,919
Why did he run away?

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Why are you looking for me?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,159
The cooperation amount of Blue Eagle,

23
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,560
why is it 18million?

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,280
The Blue Eagle is very strong,

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,439
except for the Blue Eagle,

26
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,879
We don't have

27
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
a better choice.

28
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,199
Everything is ready at Li's Mansion

29
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,960
except the east wind.

30
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,000
If the budget is stuck here,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,719
the loss is not 3million.

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,759
Do you understand?

33
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,599
This is an emergency.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
I want to report it to you.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,479
As usual,

36
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,599
you have to report to Mr. Fu.

37
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,639
So I skipped the level and reported it to him.

38
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,840
It won't happen again.

39
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,759
I'm sorry this time,

40
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,840
but if you really want what's best for the company,

41
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,360
I don't care if I don't cross the line.

42
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,560
But did you propose

43
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,000
to cancel the contest?

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
This one

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
The company wants to bid for the advertisement?

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,639
I just want to save money.

47
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,159
I think it's time consuming.

48
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,960
It takes a lot of energy,

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,759
and now I think,

50
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,479
Cut off 2million directly.

51
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,719
Show us our sincerity.

52
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,719
What about them?

53
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,479
In terms of resource allocation,

54
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,960
it will also provide better services.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
I think it's worth it.

56
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,560
Then you'd better make sure

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
she promises you,

58
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,360
It can be put into the contract.

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
We came up with the same idea.

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't worry,

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,360
when the contract comes out,

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,479
I'll show you.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,319
Get back to work.

64
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll get back to work then.

65
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,960
Hey, old schoolmate,

66
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,319
did you tell me before,

67
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,240
Your girlfriend

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,919
works in Guangke Advertising,

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes What's wrong?

70
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,400
Here's the thing.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,520
I have a favor to ask of you.

72
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,879
Hello,

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,800
there's no need.

74
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,759
Thank you.

75
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,879
-Spa. -Yes, thank you. -No, thanks. -Hello. -Spa. Get to

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,800
know

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,519
it.

78
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,040
-My number is on it. -Okay.

79
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:26,959
Hey,

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,879
Hey,

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
When are we going to have dinner together?

82
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,040
Long time no see.

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
Come out and get together.

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
Let's do it today.

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,279
You can come

86
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,319
to me.

87
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,480
Send me the location.

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,160
Okay.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,839
Hello,

90
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,120
Gu Qiao. Are you here? Welcome.

91
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you Mr. Du Bingwen?

92
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,639
Gu Qiao will be here in a while.

93
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,519
She told me.

94
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Let's treat you well first.

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,560
Let me take you to a private room.

96
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,160
This way.

97
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,160
Have a rest here.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Okay,

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,560
Can you

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,519
still eat here?

101
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,519
You can have some fruit first,

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
and I'll get you some snacks.

103
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,839
Hello, sir.

104
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,959
I'm a beautician Xiao Xiao,

105
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,920
please lie down first.

106
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,560
I'll make one for you.

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
A full facial spa. I'm not here

108
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,959
for beauty treatment.

109
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,600
Aren't you Mr. Du?

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Yes, I am.

111
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,959
That's right,

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,079
Miss Gu told me,

113
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,040
just lie down.

114
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,399
What are you doing?

115
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,720
Facial spa,

116
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,720
lie down first.

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll get some water.

118
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,959
Gu Qiao.

119
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,079
Gu Qiao.

120
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,560
I did as you said.

121
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,240
Thank you.

122
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,319
I'll buy you milk tea

123
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,759
later. Lend me your credit card machine.

124
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,439
Okay.

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,279
Here,

126
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,480
Thank you.

127
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,639
You're finally here.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
I happened to be out for some business.

129
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,639
But after you finish it,

130
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,279
you'll be young.

131
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,399
Of course. The product

132
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,680
for Mr. Du,

133
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,879
But it's the best in our shop.

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,800
Yes.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,199
How much is it?

136
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,120
This is the set meal

137
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,759
for 1888. He's my friend.

138
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,959
Can you give me a discount?

139
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
You're giving me a hard time.

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
It's a flat price in the store.

141
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,800
You're right.

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,680
But after you finish it,

143
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,879
look at your skin,

144
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,959
You're so shiny.

145
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,199
So for maintenance,

146
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,560
you still need to do it often.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,759
But it's quite expensive to do it once.

148
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,160
No, I can just get a card.

149
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,199
20% off.

150
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,759
How much is appropriate?

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,439
It depends on

152
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,120
how deep our friendship is, right?

153
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,720
10thousand

154
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,319
is enough.

155
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,800
Why are you laughing at the password?

156
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,000
One, two, three, four, five, six,

157
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,160
such a simple password,

158
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,439
This bank can pass,

159
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,279
pass.

160
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Alright,

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
let's eat. I'm starving.

162
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,439
Okay,

163
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,439
I want something to eat.

164
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,240
Japanese materials,

165
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Please

166
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,560
You're a guest. Please.

167
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,079
Hello,

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,079
thank you.

169
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,320
Enjoy your meal.

170
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,000
Enjoy your meal.

171
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,039
The food in this shop is very fresh,

172
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,879
Du Erer is more interesting than you,

173
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,840
Can you stop calling me "Second Brother"?

174
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,360
Okay,

175
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,879
On Yuan Ge's head,

176
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,480
there's Mr. Fu,

177
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
I'll call you Du Laosan,

178
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
not Second Brother.

179
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,519
Yuan Ge has a boyfriend.

180
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,200
You know that, right?

181
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,039
What does she

182
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,360
have to do with me?

183
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,120
Did you have a fight?

184
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,120
Did Yuan Ge send you here?

185
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,039
I'm telling you,

186
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,879
no matter what you say,

187
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,039
I won't forgive her.

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
No,

189
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,120
it's just because of a coincidence,

190
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,399
I know her boyfriend.

191
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,320
Not very reliable.

192
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,279
So I want to tell you,

193
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,639
he is not a good person at all.

194
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,320
I really don't understand.

195
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,799
Why is she with him?

196
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,559
Am I right?

197
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,519
Then try to persuade her.

198
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,480
Is it useful for me to persuade her?

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,399
Does she listen to me?

200
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,159
Yeah,

201
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,879
but she's just like that,

202
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,639
After so many years,

203
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,320
it's not like we don't know,

204
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,519
Fine, fine. Don't mention her

205
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,120
eating.

206
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,600
Second Brother Du,

207
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,120
Third Brother Du,

208
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,480
Tell me,

209
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,559
do you like Yuan Ge?

210
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,320
No.

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,240
You're still as weak as before.

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Go after her if you like her.

213
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
Do you really have the heart for her

214
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
to be cheated by that man?

215
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,759
Do you think we are suitable for each other?

216
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,559
Do you think it's appropriate

217
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,159
to eat Japanese food with sake?

218
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,039
It's suitable.

219
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
Why don't you order a bottle?

220
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,159
Waiter Ott Sacrifice.

221
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,120
One more sea urchin pack

222
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,799
and one more sea urchin.

223
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,080
I'll have one if you don't pack it.

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
It means

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,159
you know it yourself.

226
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,759
Yuan Ge,

227
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,399
you didn't even come down the steps.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,159
If I talk to you again,

229
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll be a puppy.

230
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,679
A dog is a dog.

231
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Wang

232
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
My feet hurt so much.

233
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
It hurts so much.

234
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,799
Yuan Ge,

235
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,919
you really left.

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,039
If Gu Qiao sees you,

237
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,200
he'll be very surprised.

238
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Really?

239
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,320
Is Gu Qiao here?

240
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,080
Gu Qiao is looking for you.

241
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,279
You're here.

242
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,960
Alex,

243
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,519
Hello,

244
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,519
Alex and I really hit it off.

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,240
I think I've met my true love.

246
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,879
So I didn't hide anything from him.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Besides,

248
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,720
selling in a spa shop,

249
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,279
It's not something

250
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,759
to hide, is it?

251
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,200
I need to answer a phone call.

252
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Go ahead.

253
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,639
What's going on between you two?

254
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,799
After thinking about it,

255
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm more suitable for dating.

256
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
The dream of becoming the best female president

257
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
of Shanghai Bund in two years,

258
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,799
It's too unrealistic.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
As a human being,

260
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,679
you should be more down-to-earth.

261
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,360
Congratulations on finding true love.

262
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,440
What if you helped me?

263
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,120
I want to keep my promise.

264
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,639
Alex said that

265
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,279
the weather has been too dry recently,

266
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,200
If you want me to apply for a card to replenish water,

267
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,159
Gu Qiao

268
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,720
is very willing to serve you.

269
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,840
Why don't you move to a private room first?

270
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,080
I'll get you a fruit bowl.

271
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,840
Okay.

272
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,679
Honey,

273
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,360
the company is really busy today,

274
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
I can't go back for now,

275
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,960
otherwise,

276
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
Go home and spend time with the kids.

277
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,159
I'll be back later.

278
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,639
Okay.

279
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,440
Sit down.

280
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
Sit down. What's wrong?

281
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,639
I just heard

282
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,840
Alex on the phone,

283
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,960
He lied to you.

284
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,240
He has a wife

285
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
and even a child.

286
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,919
I know. Why?

287
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,000
You know,

288
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,519
you know you're still with him?

289
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,879
What's the big deal?

290
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,000
You are

291
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,879
too bound by

292
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,000
secular standards.

293
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,799
Our teacher said,

294
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,240
for the sake of dreams,

295
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
You can sacrifice something.

296
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,320
All right, all right. Let's not talk about that.

297
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,639
The 30 thousand I promised to give you

298
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,720
is enough, right?

299
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,440
50thousand,

300
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,799
I'll charge another 50thousand.

301
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,679
50 thousand is not enough?

302
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,480
Well,

303
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,320
I don't need it.

304
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,399
What?

305
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,080
I don't need you to help me with my performance.

306
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,480
Why?

307
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,000
It was because of San

308
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,519
that I ended up where I am today.

309
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,559
I don't need a mistress

310
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,799
to help me with my performance.

311
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,559
Gu Qiao,

312
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,480
what are you talking about?

313
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,360
Who are you calling San?

314
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,799
Why are you pretending?

315
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,400
It's all about money.

316
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,839
Who is nobler than who?

317
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,000
Ge Zi,

318
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,680
Mei,

319
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
Do you have time to talk?

320
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,079
Sure.

321
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,079
Sit down.

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
I happen to be looking for you.

323
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,640
This is the sales report

324
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,799
of last month. I've printed it out.

325
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,480
Take a look.

326
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,960
You're the most careful.

327
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,000
Actually, I have you here.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,440
I really don't have to

329
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,519
worry about anything.

330
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,640
Besides,

331
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,079
you still have Bingwen to help you,

332
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,559
Here's the thing. What about

333
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,799
Blue Eagle's budget lately?

334
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,400
I nodded.

335
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,480
Although I know

336
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,640
it's over budget.

337
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,000
But what about Bingwen?

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
He did his best.

339
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
Mr. Fu,

340
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,039
choose Blue Eagle,

341
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,640
In order to promote Li Juncheng better,

342
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,519
if the budget

343
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,200
is within the controllable range,

344
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,319
No problem.

345
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,079
With what you said,

346
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,279
I'm relieved.

347
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,839
What's wrong with you?

348
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,359
It's the first time in my life that I've heard that

349
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,680
a customer wanted to recharge the sales

350
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,480
and was stopped.

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,079
I'll get another guest

352
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,039
later.

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,039
That's easy for you

354
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,599
to say. They're complaining about you now.

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,799
Then deduct my salary.

356
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
I won't apologize anyway.

357
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,359
I think there's something wrong

358
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,319
with your working attitude.

359
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,880
Is it okay to be a mistress?

360
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,920
No,

361
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,240
you have to recognize yourself.

362
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,759
You're just a salesperson.

363
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,039
It's not up to you to judge.

364
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,240
When it comes to other people's moral problems,

365
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,359
I think you,

366
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,119
I still

367
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,720
don't realize your serious mistake,

368
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
You're not suitable for this job at all.

369
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,920
Find another job.

370
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
Does your husband eat?

371
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,799
My friend is

372
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,960
drinking there?

373
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,279
What are you doing here?

374
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,240
I happened to pass by.

375
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,920
If you don't mind,

376
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I'll sit here for a while.

377
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,400
I had a fight with Gu Qiao.

378
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,559
She asked you to come?

379
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,039
No.

380
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,839
I just think,

381
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,079
as your old classmate,

382
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,839
I have to say something, right?

383
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,640
What about girlfriends?

384
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,640
It's normal for you

385
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
to have a fight and have some friction.

386
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,359
They come and go quickly.

387
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,319
Gu Qiao just got divorced.

388
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,240
You came to Shanghai alone,

389
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,279
and you have no one to rely on.

390
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,440
You're the only one she has.

391
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,400
Am I right?

392
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,240
You can't always analyze problems

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,839
from your own point of view.

394
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,960
You have to consider

395
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,119
her feelings,

396
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,000
I also know that she has worked hard.

397
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,839
But I just want her to know that

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,720
there is no shortcut in life,

399
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,920
Only by working hard,

400
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,200
will there be a good result.

401
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,039
That's right.

402
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,759
I know you're right.

403
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
You must be doing it for her own good.

404
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,599
Isn't she doing it

405
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,599
for your own good?

406
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,720
Do you like Zheng Jinnan?

407
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you know him well?

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,559
He doesn't suit you at all.

409
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm not done yet.

410
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,000
Where are you going?

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,079
Go find Zheng Jinnan.

412
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,160
Waiter,

413
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,839
bring me another bottle of sake.

414
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,559
Have some water.

415
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,799
I have something to tell you.

416
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,559
Tell me,

417
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,799
well.

418
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,759
In my opinion,

419
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,319
we are still not

420
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
suitable for each other.

421
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,079
Me,

422
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,880
I don't know

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,319
why you said that?

424
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,599
But it's your decision.

425
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,920
Then I respect you.

426
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
This was taken in your office.

427
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
I printed it out.

428
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,400
now

429
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,480
It seems that I should give it back to you.

430
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,599
You don't have to worry about Mr. Fu.

431
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,480
I'll explain.

432
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,599
I think the relationship between people,

433
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,960
is so wonderful.

434
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
Maybe from the beginning,

435
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,359
we didn't open it the right way.

436
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:49,920
At that time, I was thinking,

437
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,559
will you not accept me?

438
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,519
As expected

439
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,240
It didn't work out as I expected.

440
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,279
Yuan Ge,

441
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,119
thank you.

442
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,279
When I was with you,

443
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,200
I was very happy.

444
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,359
Maybe you misunderstood me

445
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,559
at first.

446
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
But you also gave me a chance.

447
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,680
Let's get along well with each other,

448
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,519
and in dealing with this relationship,

449
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,480
I think

450
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
I really like you.

451
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,680
I think you're the only one

452
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
who can light my heart, right?

453
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,599
Honey,

454
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm back.

455
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,519
Surprise or not.

456
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,279
You don't need to light it.

457
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,359
Just don't spontaneously ignite.

458
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,000
Yuan Ge,

459
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,400
Yuan Ge,

460
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,559
You,

461
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,480
Honey,

462
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,039
let me explain.

463
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,759
The next one

464
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,480
is even cuter. You're back.

465
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,759
Why are you drunk?

466
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,079
Are you okay?

467
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,680
How many times have I told you?

468
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,880
Don't make such a mess in the house.

469
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,519
Why don't you listen to me?

470
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll collect it later.

471
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,839
I said you

472
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,000
for your own good, didn't I?

473
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,599
How could I harm you?

474
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,480
Left ear in and right ear out,

475
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
now

476
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,759
take it back.

477
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,039
I'll take it right away.

478
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,079
Why did you come back?

479
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,079
Isn't it good to stay in school?

480
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,319
Why did you come back?

481
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,039
You can go back now.

482
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,559
Let's really go back.

483
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,319
You're making a mess

484
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,000
of my life.

485
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,440
You even drank so much wine from me.

486
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,119
Brother,

487
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,440
Actually, I came back this time.

488
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,279
Are you stupid?

489
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,920
If you don't earn money,

490
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,440
you also think you're stupid, don't you?

491
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,400
I've got the money.

492
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,880
If you insist on getting angry,

493
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,279
you'll lose your job

494
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,400
in anger.

495
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,400
What should we do?

496
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,519
Something's wrong.

497
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,839
Yuan Ge,

498
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,279
have you ever been to another city?

499
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,599
What's the farthest place

500
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,720
you've been to?

501
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,279
Shanghai,

502
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
Shanghai,

503
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm going to Shanghai, too.

504
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,119
Yuan Ge,

505
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,640
let's go to Shanghai together in the future,

506
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,160
Okay?

507
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,359
Zheng Jinnan and I,

508
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,480
it's not what you think.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,920
He's not the kind of person you said.

510
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,680
What kind of person is that?

511
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,559
What I care about is,

512
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,559
you're my bestie,

513
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,839
I want you to be honest with me.

514
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,960
I don't want you to lie to me.

515
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,400
Zheng Jinnan and I broke up.

516
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,240
You're right.

517
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,960
He's a liar!

518
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,319
I quit.

519
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You're right.

520
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,799
Chuchu has no bottom line.

521
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,759
You're right.

522
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,720
At the end of the day,

523
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,839
I didn't even vent my anger on myself.

524
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,319
I think we can't just

525
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,640
look at the result.

526
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,119
At least through this period of time,

527
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,480
I saw a different

528
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,640
Gu Qiao,

529
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
I've never thought about it.

530
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,319
Gu Qiao, who is used to living a comfortable life,

531
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,000
could work so hard

532
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,880
one day,

533
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,960
That's because I owe you money.

534
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,359
Luckily, I owe you.

535
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,160
If it were someone else,

536
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,880
I... I wouldn't be able to sleep.

537
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,920
The creditor is ordering you to sleep now.

538
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,279
Ge Ge,

539
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,039
what do you think of Second Brother Du?

540
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,359
Not so good.

541
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,119
Wait for me.

542
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,599
Stop!

543
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,680
I can't do it anymore.

544
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,400
Ms. Gu Qiao,

545
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,759
you're young,

546
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,279
My body and bones are not working.

547
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,720
I can't do it anymore.

548
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,799
I regret it.

549
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,200
From tomorrow on,

550
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,880
you run on your own,

551
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,839
I won't run away with you.

552
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,960
Then you have to finish

553
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,039
the five kilometers today.

554
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,640
I'll wait for you at the finish line.

555
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Goodbye.

556
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,920
I'll wait for you at home.

557
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,359
Oh my goodness.

558
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,280
Hello, Director.

559
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,000
How's the business today?

560
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,599
Don't mess with useless things.

561
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,760
If you have something to say,

562
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,599
I just want to ask,

563
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,079
When will my salary be paid?

564
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,440
You caused us to lose

565
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
such a big client,

566
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,960
It's good that we won't let you lose money.

567
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,639
How dare you ask for a salary?

568
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,400
No.

569
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,159
The contract law doesn't have such a rule.

570
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,599
You didn't say you won't get paid

571
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,920
if you're fired.

572
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,599
Didn't I tell you before?

573
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,280
We don't have a guaranteed salary here,

574
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,760
and you haven't become a full-time employee,

575
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,280
I don't even have a bonus.

576
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,039
Sales live

577
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,119
on bonuses.

578
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,760
Performance awards are given quarterly,

579
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,039
even if you become a full member,

580
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,440
We'll have to wait for another two months.

581
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,239
Hey,

582
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,960
why are you doing this?

583
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,360
I've resigned.

584
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,079
Shouldn't it be settled

585
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,360
when you resign?

586
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,559
That's the company's rule,

587
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:56,559
Me.

588
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,079
Come in.

589
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,880
Mr. Yuan wants to see me,

590
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,519
Sister Wang,

591
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,000
Can you take a look at this resume for me,

592
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,199
and see if there is

593
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,599
a suitable position for her?

594
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,719
Salary and position are second,

595
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,119
the key depends on the matching degree.

596
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,920
Okay.

597
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,960
This is very good.

598
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,239
It's selling the best now.

599
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,039
How is the effect?

600
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,960
If I really see the effect,

601
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,119
I can consider it.

602
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,719
Didn't I make it clear to you

603
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,719
on the phone?

604
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,719
Why are you still here?

605
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,559
Did you make it clear?

606
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,559
But I didn't agree.

607
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,199
Excuse me, please wait a moment.

608
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:56,800
Shan Shan.

609
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
Help me receive it,

610
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,800
Okay,

611
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,519
Come with me.

612
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,000
Hello,

613
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,039
didn't you see I'm serving a client?

614
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,079
Why are you yelling?

615
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,880
That's your client.

616
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,639
He's not my client.

617
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,599
Why should I wait?

618
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,280
Also,

619
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,559
why don't you pay me now?

620
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,079
Or,

621
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,079
I'll ask my friend to return the card.

622
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,800
Make your own choice.

623
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,440
You.

624
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,360
Okay,

625
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,880
you can do it right away.

626
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
I'll finish it for you

627
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,079
right away. Let me try this.

628
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,719
Okay,

629
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,880
come with me.

630
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,639
Okay.

631
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,400
Hello Hello

632
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,920
Hello Are you Miss Gu?

633
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,960
-Yes, you are. -Yes, I'm

634
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,039
Shu Mei.

635
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,199
Personnel Department,

636
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,280
my surname is Wang,

637
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,280
Are you free on Tuesday?

638
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,960
If you're free,

639
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,159
I'll be there on time.

640
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,480
I always thought that

641
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,239
we were going to

642
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,440
cooperate honestly.

643
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,280
What a surprise.

644
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,360
Mr. Du is playing

645
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,639
such a lame trick with me.

646
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,800
Now that our boss knows,

647
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,039
you've been in contact with Guangke?

648
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,679
I'm not a human

649
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,079
inside or outside.

650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Misunderstanding?

651
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
There must be some misunderstanding here.

652
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,000
Blue Eagle has always been Shumei's

653
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,239
first choice.

654
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,199
Give me some time,

655
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,239
I'll go back and find out.

656
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
I'll give you an explanation then.

657
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,039
What do you think?

658
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,760
No need.

659
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,039
Without Shu Mei,

660
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,679
it doesn't matter

661
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,559
to me.

662
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,639
I understand.

663
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,880
No matter what,

664
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,039
it's my fault.

665
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,719
I'll be the host another day,

666
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,960
to apologize to you,

667
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,199
The point is that the situation is awkward now,

668
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
and you and your boss

669
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,119
also brushed their faces.

670
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,079
I also had a contract

671
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,119
with my boss,

672
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,880
If you suddenly stop now,

673
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,119
it won't be worthwhile for both you and me.

674
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,880
Am I right?

675
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,400
If you want to continue working together

676
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,159
after all this,

677
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,480
Shu Mei has to show

678
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,639
some real sincerity,

679
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Tell me.

680
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,039
We are sincere.

681
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,360
As long as I can do it,

682
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,079
you say,

683
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,599
20million,

684
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,400
and fire the initiator.

685
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,920
The resources are still

686
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
the ones I promised you,

687
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,719
It won't change.

688
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,920
Can we discuss it again?

689
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,960
What do you think?

690
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,599
I'll wait for your reply.

691
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,639
I was going to

692
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,440
spread some fake news.

693
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,519
Let Blue Eagle think that

694
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,679
we are also talking about cooperation with Guangke,

695
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,599
Thereby prompting them to lower their prices.

696
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,199
But two advertising companies

697
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,000
bid for jobs,

698
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,360
Isn't it right to choose the one

699
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,679
with a lower price?

700
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,519
It's because

701
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:34,760
we gave up the contest,

702
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,719
That's why Blue Eagle

703
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,079
is so open-mouthed.

704
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,800
You're teaching me how to do things.

705
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:45,920
Mr. Du,

706
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,599
what do they want to do?

707
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,920
20million

708
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,960
fired the initiator,

709
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,079
20million,

710
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,599
this is too exaggerated.

711
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
1. 8thousand is enough.

712
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,639
You even want to fire Manager Zheng.

713
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,079
Bingwen,

714
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,800
Before,

715
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,320
Didn't you say you had a good chat

716
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,599
with Maggie?

717
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,840
Is there no other way?

718
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,440
What Manager Zheng did,

719
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,639
seriously violated the sincerity

720
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,119
of cooperation with Blue Eagle.

721
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,639
If we still want to get

722
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,719
our original price back,

723
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,920
You have to fire Manager Zheng.

724
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,079
If you fire Jeong Yeon Hee,

725
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
can Mr. Du guarantee that

726
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,960
the original price will be discussed?

727
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,599
We can only say that we can see

728
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,039
if Blue Eagle

729
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,159
can help Li Meng to go public.

730
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,119
Still unknown.

731
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,440
Instead of being led

732
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,480
by Party B,

733
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,000
I'd rather fight for a better choice

734
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,639
with 20 million.

735
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,000
You're right.

736
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,679
In terms of strength and resources,

737
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,320
Guangke is far better than Blue Eagle.

738
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,400
But Guangke has always only served

739
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,719
the top international brands,

740
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,159
Shumei is not

741
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,599
considered by them at all.

742
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,800
Bingwen,

743
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,719
if we can really

744
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,280
work well with Blue Eagle.

745
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,440
According to your plan,

746
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,000
what do you think of our new product,

747
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,079
And the promotion of the listing of Li Juncheng.

748
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,280
When is it expected

749
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,199
to start.

750
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,639
Within a month,

751
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,360
if after a month,

752
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,840
Can't it go public as scheduled?

753
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,039
What will Shumei lose?

754
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,559
To put it mildly,

755
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,000
Li Meng didn't get off to a good start,

756
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,480
Competing products took the opportunity to sing bad,

757
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,280
which means that

758
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,159
Shumei's transformation failed.

759
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,119
Ge Zi,

760
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,480
are you confident?

761
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,880
We can take care of Guangke

762
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,079
in a month,

763
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'll do my best.

764
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,679
For things you can't do,

765
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,239
it's best not to promise easily.

766
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,840
We are racing against time.

767
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,199
Missed the opportunity.

768
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,039
It will be hard to reverse the ending.

769
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,000
Let's do it for one month,

770
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,079
Mr. Fu,

771
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,280
After a month,

772
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,599
if I can't get the Light Division,

773
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,840
I resigned voluntarily,
