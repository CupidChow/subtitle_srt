1
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,159
Dad,

2
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,719
Why did you get up so early?

3
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
You scared me.

4
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
I can't fall asleep.

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,400
I said

6
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,439
Take a stroll on the Bund.

7
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,519
Let me go with you.

8
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:07,959
No need.

9
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,599
Have a good sleep. You only

10
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,919
get one chance a week.

11
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,240
I can go by myself.

12
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,199
Let me go with you.

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm going for a run anyway.

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Yuan Ge.

15
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,080
Let me tell you,

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,599
yesterday, Sun said

17
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,599
he was going to take his mother,

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
Go visit the Oriental Pearl

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,199
and ask me to come with you.

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,319
I … I promised them.

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,039
Dad,

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,479
So you want to

23
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,919
visit the Oriental Pearl,

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
When I asked you last time,

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
I wanted to take you there,

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Why don't you go?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm not staying at home alone.

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Are you bored?

29
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,039
I can go by myself.

30
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,319
Run by yourself.

31
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,680
We were supposed

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,120
to meet at the Bund pier.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,960
Dad,

34
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,240
Let me go with you.

35
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,800
It's a sport anyway.

36
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,599
I can also take pictures

37
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,560
for you or something,

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,879
Yuan Ge,

39
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,439
it's not that I don't want you

40
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,360
to stay with me.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,479
I'll go with them.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,719
It's my relationship

43
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,879
with Sun and his mother.

44
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,759
If you go with me,

45
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,800
Du will know,

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
That's not good.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Then don't let him know.

48
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,199
There's no reason for my dad

49
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,919
to let someone else's son accompany him

50
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,360
when he wants to visit the scenic spot, right?

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Wait for me.

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,319
I'm going to get changed.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,000
This kid.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
You have to take the back inside.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,439
Dad, this is the Oriental Pearl.

56
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,120
It's so beautiful and magnificent.

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,400
There are so many people here.

58
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,800
We can go to

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,479
Nanjing Road later.

60
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,280
It's not that your aunt Sun and the others

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
are here or not,

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
What do you think?

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,919
Over there.

64
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,840
Am I fat?

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,919
Aunt Sun,

66
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,960
You're here early.

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm here.

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Uncle Yuan.

69
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,479
Sun,

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,719
Sun Bin Hello, Aunt Sun,

71
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,840
Yuan Ge, why are you here?

72
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,560
Today is the weekend?

73
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,719
I happen to be free.

74
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,680
Come out for a walk with my dad.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
How nice of you to be here.

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,439
Right?

77
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,919
The four of us,

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,599
Yes.

79
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,800
Let's go to

80
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,360
the Oriental Pearl,

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,279
Do you need a ticket here?

82
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,839
Yes

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Sun Bin,

84
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
make a reservation.

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
I've booked everything.

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,839
But I didn't know Yuan Ge was coming,

87
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,079
but now I'm booking tickets online,

88
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,560
It's very convenient.

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll book one for you now.

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,800
Hurry up,

91
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,279
I'll transfer it to you

92
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,319
via WeChat. Can't I transfer it?

93
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,000
Well,

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
I think the view here is very good,

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Let's take

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,199
a group photo first.

97
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's take

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,279
a picture first.

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,319
Find someone,

100
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,439
find someone, find someone,

101
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,800
Why don't you call that young man?

102
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,360
Come with your aunt

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
next to your aunt,

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,639
Auntie,

105
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes.

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,800
Come here.

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,120
Come on,

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,759
Stand in the middle.

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,839
-Aunty. -No need. Mom, you

110
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,720
and uncle stand in the middle.

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,639
The young man is standing in the middle,

112
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,079
but the old man is so ugly standing next to him

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,519
Okay,

114
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:53,959
Right?

115
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,720
Come on,

116
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,160
let's start when we're ready.

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Miss,

118
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,639
lean forward.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
Lean a little. Good,

120
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
good.

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Come on,

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,399
Three, two, one.

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,720
Ge Ge.

124
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,639
I went to the Bund with my dad.

125
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,480
You're awake.

126
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,519
Get yourself something to eat.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
I need to exercise,

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,959
you see,

129
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,360
That's right.

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,399
Dad,

131
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,560
I need to answer a phone call.

132
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,560
You go first.

133
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,040
Yuan, can you do it?

134
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
It's quite far for you

135
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,920
to walk like this. No problem.

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,439
Hey,

137
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,040
Why didn't you call me

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,519
when you went to the Bund?

139
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,279
My dad wants to go out for a walk.

140
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,399
He has an appointment with Sun Bin,

141
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,759
He didn't want to tell me,

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
but Sun Bin was there too.

143
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,399
Sun Bin showed his mom around,

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,199
and his mom was there, too

145
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,199
Well,

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,519
You guys go shopping first.

147
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,199
I'll be back

148
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,680
later. Bye.

149
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,160
Second Brother Du,

150
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,519
your girlfriend and future father-in-law,

151
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,720
We're walking around the Bund.

152
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,000
Pack up and go there.

153
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,360
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

154
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,439
Sun Bin and his mom are here too.

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
Goodbye.

156
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,920
The wind is so comfortable.

157
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,079
You feel like the air

158
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,600
is fragrant.

159
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,480
That's right.

160
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
We're taking advantage

161
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,560
of our child.

162
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
That's right.

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,920
Sun is so promising.

164
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,800
Yeah,

165
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
my daughter, too,

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Your daughter is promising

167
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,399
and beautiful,

168
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,319
Come here. Come here.

169
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Auntie, be careful.

170
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,160
Tell me,

171
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,480
If we really become in-laws,

172
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,160
my life will be perfect.

173
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,800
What are you doing?

174
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm just sighing,

175
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,040
I died without regrets.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Dad,

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,680
I think the scenery here is good.

178
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,839
Let me take a picture of you.

179
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,439
Okay.

180
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,800
Come on.

181
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,879
Look at this one.

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,959
Zoom in on this one.

183
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,759
I can see it clearly.

184
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,560
This one is good.

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,319
That's good.

186
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll send it to you later.

187
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,160
Okay,

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
This one,

189
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
except that it's a little bad here,

190
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,240
Everything else is good.

191
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,679
Not bad.

192
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,799
Just lay it off. That's good.

193
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,320
This one

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
is not good.

195
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,080
A little bit.

196
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm telling you, your picture,

197
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,120
You put all the photos

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,080
in your phone,

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,879
You, you,

200
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,720
you all give it to Sun Bin,

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm telling you, you can send it to him

202
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
to fix the picture,

203
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,440
You know how to fix pictures?

204
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,759
Don't listen to my mom.

205
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,759
I just know how to order everything.

206
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,639
But I'm not good at anything.

207
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,759
It's not that

208
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,639
you're too modest.

209
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,320
You're not

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,000
the one

211
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,080
who won many awards

212
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,559
at school.

213
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,080
Isn't it just with that

214
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,399
photo or something?

215
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
The one you mentioned

216
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,000
is not next to this one.

217
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
Why do you call it

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
"not next to each other"?

219
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Look at what you said,

220
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Ge Ge,

221
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,159
Gu Qiao,

222
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,919
you jerk,

223
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,720
It just popped out.

224
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,600
Didn't I come to see you?

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm afraid

226
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,720
you'll be taken away by others.

227
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,000
She's not a kid.

228
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,200
It's okay,

229
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,919
uncle.

230
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,279
Du Bingwen is also here,

231
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,600
and he specially booked a restaurant,

232
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,720
He said we'd have dinner together tonight,

233
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,159
but it's not easy to park nearby,

234
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,120
He stopped at the side of the road.

235
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,279
Let's just walk over there.

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,919
Well,

237
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm afraid you won't be free today.

238
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,039
That's why you came out with us,

239
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,639
since you're all here,

240
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,720
Let's split up.

241
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, okay, okay.

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,159
What are you doing? I haven't done enough shopping.

243
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,480
You.

244
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
-Let's go. -Something's wrong. It's

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
not you. It's interesting.

246
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,440
Sun,

247
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,480
Well,

248
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
If there's nothing else,

249
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,919
let's do it together.

250
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,639
She … Aunt Sun,

251
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,159
Uncle

252
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,759
Auntie, are you okay?

253
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,600
Auntie, are you okay?

254
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
What are you doing?

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,679
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,559
You're too reliable.

257
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,879
Du Bingwen

258
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,960
did specifically tell us

259
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,320
to invite you two.

260
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,399
Let's have dinner together,

261
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,480
and thank you for taking care of Uncle Yuan

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
during this period of time,

263
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,440
But,

264
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,000
do you have something to do?

265
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,080
You can go first.

266
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,799
It's okay.

267
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm fine.

268
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,519
That's great.

269
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,039
-Great. -Let's go. Let's

270
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,519
go.

271
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,320
lane one

272
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
Let's go, Sun. Let's go.

273
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,480
Let's go.

274
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,600
Then let's go.

275
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,440
Let's go.

276
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,720
Why are you pulling me?

277
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,799
Uncle, you really care about it.

278
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,519
What are you talking about?

279
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,519
Aunt Sun,

280
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,000
here you are.

281
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,240
They're following us.

282
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,600
It hurts so much that I'm pulling it,

283
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,480
uncle.

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,919
Where is the car?

285
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,600
It's here.

286
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,799
It's here.

287
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Hurry up, son.

288
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,279
Uncle, get in the car first.

289
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,120
Be careful.

290
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,679
Darn you

291
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,120
your aunt Sun first,

292
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Let me sit in the back with you.

293
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't worry.

294
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,679
Watch your legs.

295
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,480
Watch out!

296
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
No, you have to let me go up.

297
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,679
Aunt,

298
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,639
let me tell you,

299
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,039
I can't sit in this car anymore.

300
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,919
I've got you

301
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,759
a luxury car.

302
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,919
Wait. I'll be right there.

303
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,480
I can sit down.

304
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,360
What a waste.

305
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,840
What luxury car is it called?

306
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,240
I can squeeze it.

307
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Mom,

308
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,279
Let's go back, too.

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,759
If you haven't had enough fun,

310
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,799
I'll walk around with you

311
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,519
this afternoon,

312
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,399
I have something else to do.

313
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,799
What are you shopping for?

314
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,080
What are you doing all day?

315
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm helping you

316
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,399
with your ideas. You said

317
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,240
you had such a good chance

318
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,559
and just ran away.

319
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,919
Are you stupid or not?

320
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,559
You're not mom,

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
Can you not meddle in my business?

322
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
What do you mean?

323
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,240
If I don't care about you, who cares about you?

324
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,840
We don't care about each other.

325
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,480
Is it OK?

326
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,559
I don't care about you either.

327
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,200
Go,

328
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,399
go and play with them.

329
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,039
You're so funny.

330
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay,

331
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,600
Go play with them.

332
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Aunt, our car is here.

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,320
Come on,

334
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Didn't you ask for a luxury car?

335
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Not satisfied?

336
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
Auntie, here's the thing,

338
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
I know you want to set up your son,

339
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Ge Ge with my family,

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,519
but Ge Ge,

341
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,720
You already have a boyfriend.

342
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,120
And their relationship

343
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,399
is very strong.

344
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,879
Of course. What if

345
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,919
you insist on seeing this relative?

346
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,440
I think uncle is single too,

347
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,799
although I don't think

348
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,679
you two are suitable for each other.

349
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,279
But you can give it a try.

350
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,120
How can you say that?

351
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,519
Are you well-bred, kid?

352
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,000
You're so young,

353
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,840
and you don't know how to speak properly.

354
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,600
Am I right?

355
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm telling you,

356
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,840
I'm a single mom,

357
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,600
I raised

358
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,080
my child so hard,

359
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,919
How much have you suffered?

360
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,759
I know it myself.

361
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,679
I just want my son

362
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,919
to find someone with good conditions,

363
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,960
Did I do anything wrong?

364
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,519
If you're looking for someone,

365
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,039
do you also want to

366
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,519
find someone with a good condition,

367
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,399
I'm looking for a normal one.

368
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,120
You're bragging. You're here?

369
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,200
Auntie,

370
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,840
if you want to find someone with good conditions,

371
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,559
No problem.

372
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,919
But if you're looking for a single man,

373
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,480
Ge Ge

374
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,639
already has a boyfriend.

375
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,039
I don't think it's appropriate

376
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
for you to do so.

377
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,159
Aren't you married?

378
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,440
Young people can't be sure

379
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,519
when they're in a relationship.

380
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,279
It's not a good thing,

381
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,559
forget it,

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,960
Yuan has a best friend like you,

383
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,279
and you two are close

384
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,080
to each other. Are you going or not?

385
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,559
There are a lot of orders during the rush hour,

386
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,720
so Master canceled it.

387
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,279
I'm sorry. Please leave.

388
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,080
No, no, no. Cancel it

389
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,919
that

390
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,720
Master, take me home.

391
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,159
You pay for it.

392
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,360
You.

393
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,759
Sir, let's go.

394
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
The weather is nice today.

395
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,679
Uncle, do you think

396
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,519
the scenery here is okay?

397
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,600
It's so quiet.

398
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,840
It doesn't look like Shanghai anymore.

399
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,799
This used to be the French Concession,

400
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,399
a lot of famous people from Shanghai,

401
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,399
They all live here.

402
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,399
But now

403
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,159
many places

404
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,279
have been converted into tourist attractions.

405
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,759
But now, on the whole,

406
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,039
it's still well preserved.

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,519
French Concession.

408
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,440
This is a disgrace

409
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,879
to our nation in the past.

410
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,240
You young people should remember,

411
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,759
my dad is a veteran cadre,

412
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,559
No

413
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,360
You're right.

414
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,759
My dad used to

415
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,080
work in the area ahead,

416
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,840
When I was little,

417
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,480
my mom and I

418
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
always came to deliver food to my dad,

419
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,039
So, this piece

420
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,559
is also my childhood memory.

421
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Your parents

422
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,559
must be on good terms.

423
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,559
It's so good.

424
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,440
Once,

425
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,720
my mom and I

426
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,759
came to pick up my dad from work.

427
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,320
As a result, after they were connected,

428
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,279
they got bored in front of each other,

429
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,799
You forgot about me.

430
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,799
Then I got lost.

431
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
Later, everyone said,

432
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,039
they are the true love.

433
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,440
It was an accident.

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,559
-Hello, Gu Qiao. -Hello,

435
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,679
Ge Ge.

436
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,519
Sun Bin's mother had a stomachache,

437
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,879
so they went back first.

438
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,840
It's rare for the three of you to get together,

439
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
so I won't join in the fun.

440
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm going back, too.

441
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,759
You guys are so delicious.

442
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,639
I'm hanging up.

443
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,120
You.

444
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,879
I'm hanging up.

445
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,360
What's wrong?

446
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,960
Gu Qiao said that

447
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
Aunt Sun is not feeling well,

448
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,120
So I won't come.

449
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
Didn't we make a deal?

450
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,559
Hello,

451
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,559
Aunt Sun,

452
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,960
I heard that

453
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
you're not feeling well today,

454
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
Are you feeling better now?

455
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,840
Well.

456
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,559
Uncle Yuan.

457
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,360
Sun,

458
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,480
are you looking for me?

459
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Is it convenient?

460
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,559
Is it convenient?

461
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,360
It's convenient.

462
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,000
I just sent a WeChat message

463
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,360
to your mom,

464
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,200
But somehow,

465
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,039
what are you talking about?

466
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,480
Me

467
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,759
Your Yuan family has a big family,

468
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,519
we can't afford to climb it.

469
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
Don't call me again.

470
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Do you hear me?

471
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,200
If your daughter is looking for a volunteer,

472
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,360
look elsewhere. "

473
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,679
Me,

474
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
Yuan Ge,

475
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,279
where's Gu Qiao?

476
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,920
In the room,

477
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
what did Gu Qiao say to Aunt Sun?

478
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
You've become so popular.

479
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
He blocked my WeChat account.

480
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll call Sun

481
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,039
and ask what's going on.

482
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
Your aunt Sun took the phone,

483
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,200
and scolded me.

484
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Hang up the phone.

485
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,480
Dad,

486
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,400
Here's the thing. Where's

487
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,440
Gu Qiao?

488
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
She was afraid that Du Bingwen would misunderstand

489
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,920
if I went out with Sun Bin,

490
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,400
So I found a reason,

491
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,720
and sent Aunt Sun away.

492
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,319
Cut it out.

493
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,119
She scolded him away.

494
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,799
What did she say?

495
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Dad,

496
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,640
She doesn't dare to come out to see you anymore.

497
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,680
Don't ask.

498
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,319
Then.

499
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,079
Okay.

500
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,079
This matter

501
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
is really easy for me.

502
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,000
I really didn't consider

503
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,039
your feelings.

504
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,000
Actually, it's my fault.

505
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,519
I thought keeping him by my side

506
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,920
would be filial piety.

507
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,480
Let's take uncle

508
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,759
fishing in the suburbs this weekend.

509
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,359
It's a five-hour drive back and forth.

510
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,640
It's not a traffic jam.

511
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,680
Maybe

512
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
I should learn chess.

513
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
You.

514
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,559
No. Why me?

515
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,799
Shouldn't it be Du Bingwen?

516
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,079
Uncle has only this hobby,

517
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,240
can't he cooperate with him?

518
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,039
Tell him tomorrow.

519
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,279
1000,

520
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Two thousand,

521
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
What are you talking about?

522
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
I'll get a raise

523
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,839
next month, right?

524
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
I can give my family

525
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,799
more subsidies in the future,

526
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,599
I can pay you

527
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,279
two thousand yuan more each month.

528
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
Ge Ge, you're right.

529
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,119
If you work hard,

530
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,799
you won't be disappointed.

531
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,279
I'm sorry.

532
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,519
It's noon,

533
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,960
I even asked you to make a trip.

534
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,400
No.

535
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,640
I'm also meeting clients nearby.

536
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,759
Do you have something

537
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,799
to tell me?

538
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,640
Actually, Gu Qiao told me about

539
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,359
what happened on the Bund yesterday,

540
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm sorry.

541
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
Actually, Gu Qiao,

542
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,400
Sometimes she's straightforward

543
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,039
and doesn't care much about other people's feelings.

544
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
Actually, I should be the one

545
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,039
who should say sorry.

546
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,799
My mom has a bad temper,

547
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,559
but when she gets angry,

548
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,680
You don't care about anything,

549
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,599
and you even scold me.

550
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,359
I left that day.

551
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,759
I didn't mean anything else.

552
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
If you don't want Mr. Du to misunderstand you,

553
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,079
please don't say that.

554
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,559
How are you?

555
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,480
I know very well.

556
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,559
Yuan Ge,

557
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,720
I really think,

558
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,839
In the city of Shanghai,

559
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,880
make a true friend.

560
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
It's very difficult.

561
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,000
So I really cherish you.

562
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,119
But sometimes my mom

563
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
makes my position awkward.

564
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,440
There's nothing I can do about her.

565
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
So, don't take

566
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,440
what she said to heart.

567
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Okay?

568
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,359
Anyway,

569
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,440
I think what happened to Gu Qiao yesterday,

570
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,880
You've gone too far.

571
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,279
I must apologize to you

572
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:44,920
face to face,

573
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,519
What you said is too serious.

574
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,119
We are such good friends,

575
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,319
such a small matter,

576
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,279
Just turn it over.

577
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,079
When Uncle Yuan

578
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,160
wants to play chess in the future,

579
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,680
Call me anytime.

580
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,519
I'll be there for you anytime.

581
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,200
Thank you.

582
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,279
What is it?

583
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,640
The post-90 s cartoonist Bai Xue

584
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,400
was suspected of plagiarizing and tied up with Shu Mei to plagiarize

585
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
cartoonists,

586
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,599
They have been on

587
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,599
the fifth and tenth searches respectively,

588
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,960
And our official Weibo

589
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
and WeChat comments

590
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,000
are full of scolding.

591
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,480
The e-commerce company also sent a message,

592
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,279
saying that the backstage

593
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,640
is completely paralyzed now.

594
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,039
The customers collectively want to return the goods.

595
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,759
I'm sorry.

596
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,880
I neglected my duty,

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,960
Now is not

598
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,920
the time for accountability,

599
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,839
Mr. Du,

600
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,000
take Gu Qiao

601
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,160
to the animation company,

602
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,920
Find out

603
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,680
the whole story,

604
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,359
If the plagiarism is true,

605
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,599
we have to get them to come forward.

606
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,559
Take responsibility.

607
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,880
Let's go.

608
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,119
Can you find the source of the news?

609
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,720
Sure.

610
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,799
This account is called

611
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,279
Jia Long Struggle,

612
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,839
Find out when he registered.

613
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,599
What did you post before?

614
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,440
Who do you care about?

615
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,400
Are you a competitor

616
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,880
of this animation company,

617
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,839
They are deliberately discrediting,

618
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,319
Okay.

619
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,799
Hold on.

620
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,000
Jia Long is struggling.

621
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,880
He said on Microblog

622
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
that he's going to do a live broadcast tonight,

623
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,799
Publish evidence of plagiarism

624
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,960
and let Bai Xue's "fans" ask for trouble.

625
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
It doesn't seem like a simple

626
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,599
malicious smear and hype,

627
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
I took a look,

628
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,200
and his Weibo account

629
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,359
was registered six years ago.

630
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
I usually post some

631
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,440
daily stuff,

632
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,319
But three years ago,

633
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,200
he posted a post on Weibo,

634
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,759
He said his grandfather

635
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,839
was a great painter,

636
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,240
It's a pity that he's not talented enough.

637
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,200
The night scene is bleak.

638
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,960
Judging from what he said,

639
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,359
he decided that Bai Xue

640
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,720
copied his grandfather's painting.

641
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,599
Once it's broadcast live,

642
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,680
it's confirmed that Bai Xue plagiarized it.

643
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,240
Then Shumei will be in trouble too.

644
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
It's not the melon eaters

645
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,519
who are scary right now,

646
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,319
But those

647
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,799
who are jealous of Shumei's competitors.

648
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,920
I guess they are

649
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,599
thinking of ways

650
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,200
to smear us.

651
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:53,960
Yanxi,

652
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,480
go get in touch with him.

653
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,640
Jia Long is struggling.

654
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,079
No matter what method I use,

655
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,400
I must do it before the live broadcast,

656
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,039
When I saw this man,

657
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:00,400
Okay,

658
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,119
Dismissed.

659
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,559
Hello,

660
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,039
Miss Du Gu,

661
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,680
Is Mr. Wang here?

662
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,759
Mr. Wang is not here today,

663
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,759
Miss Gu,

664
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,039
Mr. Wang is really not here today.

665
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:22,839
Mr. Wang,

666
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,079
don't come near me.

667
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Don't come near me.

668
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Come here again.

669
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,279
If you push me again, I'll jump.

670
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:27,880
Mr. Wang,

671
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,519
calm down,

672
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,720
Come down and talk to me.

673
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,359
It's not easy for me either.

674
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,279
After losing money on investment all my life,

675
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,880
I finally saw the country go viral.

676
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,440
Do I want to turn over?

677
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,240
Who would have thought that

678
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,640
when I met Bai Xue,

679
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
She tricked me to death.

680
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,839
You … Why are you looking for her and

681
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,839
me?

682
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,319
Yes, yes, yes. You have something to talk about.

683
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,000
Come down. Let's sit here and talk.

684
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,279
Let's go find Bai Xue together.

685
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,039
No, you can give me

686
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,039
Bai Xue's address.

687
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,119
If I can find her,

688
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,400
how can I be like this?

689
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I don't want to live anymore.

690
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,200
Then you wouldn't have jumped.

691
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,720
Yes.

692
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,119
It would be great if you could die if you jumped down.

693
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,839
You can't die.

694
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,039
What if he's half-dead?

695
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,960
You think I don't dare to jump, do you?

696
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,319
Let me show you.

697
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,759
Are you going to cheat like this again?

698
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,039
I'm suing you.

699
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,559
Are you going to sue me?

700
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,519
Are you going to sue me or not?

701
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,119
I can't even work in my company anymore.

702
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:09,839
That makes sense.

703
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,759
Come on.

704
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,680
Let me help you.

705
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,759
What are you doing?

706
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,480
What are you doing?

707
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,160
Jump.

708
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,759
I'll dance with you after you finish.

709
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,160
Jump,

710
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,519
What are you doing?

711
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,519
Are you going to jump or not?

712
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,119
-I won't jump. -Give

713
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,599
me the address.

714
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,839
Enjoy your meal.

715
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,559
Thank you.

716
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,200
Now,

717
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,599
it's time for you to grow up.

718
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,279
Eat more protein.

719
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,559
This tomato is very sweet.

720
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,200
Pick it up.

721
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,240
Is there anything I can't listen to?

722
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,640
What is it?

723
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,240
All right,

724
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,359
book me

725
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,359
the earliest flight tomorrow.

726
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,839
I told you,

727
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,960
no one wants you to come

728
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,559
and you don't have to come anymore.

729
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,079
Mr. Jia,

730
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,319
we asked you here today

731
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,799
to solve this problem.

732
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,240
Because once the situation is true,

733
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,720
Shumei will also be the victim.

734
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,240
From the standpoint,

735
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:12,960
we are on the same side

736
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
as you.

737
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,400
How can you solve it?

738
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,799
Can you get Bai Xue to come forward?

739
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,880
Admit that you plagiarized,

740
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,279
or can you clear my grandpa's name?

741
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,839
We are working

742
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,000
in that direction,

743
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,079
Mr. Jia,

744
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
time is running out.

745
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,160
Can you cancel

746
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,279
tonight's live broadcast first.

747
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,440
That's what you said?

748
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,400
It's impossible.

749
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,640
Because once the live broadcast,

750
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,880
in a short time,

751
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
Netizens are out of sympathy,

752
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,720
or out of the mood to join in the fun,

753
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,599
I'm on your side.

754
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,279
But have you ever thought,

755
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,559
since Bai Xue dares to plagiarize,

756
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,759
Will she have no back hand?

757
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
She has a PR team,

758
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,000
and if she bites back,

759
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,359
He said you were hyping up,

760
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,839
what you have to face,

761
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,799
Not only the melon eaters

762
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,599
who don't know the truth,

763
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,400
And a lot of unscrupulous marketing numbers,

764
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
when the time comes,

765
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
What do you want to do?

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
Mr. Jia,

767
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,519
we really don't want,

768
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,519
You and your grandpa,

769
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,400
in this matter,

770
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
I got a second injury.

771
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,319
Have some water,

772
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,519
Mr. Jia.

773
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,079
Time is running out.

774
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,839
Please cancel the live broadcast.

775
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,920
Trust us.

776
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,880
Why should I trust you?

777
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,119
What are we going to do?

778
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,759
So you can cancel the live broadcast tonight.

779
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,119
My grandpa told me that

780
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,799
he saw it on TV,

781
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,200
If Shumei wants to cooperate with Bai Xue,

782
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
she went to your company

783
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
to make it clear.

784
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,359
That day,

785
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,920
it was an employee named Gu Qiao.

786
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,519
I received him,

787
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,039
and promised my grandpa,

788
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,680
Report this matter

789
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,799
to your leader.

790
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,559
But what happened?

791
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,720
No, I'm still perfunctory about my grandpa.

792
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,039
My grandpa

793
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,160
was so angry that he was hospitalized.

794
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,200
Unless you fire Gu Qiao,

795
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,599
the live stream will continue.

796
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,279
Mr. Jia,

797
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,319
I think there must be

798
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,920
some misunderstanding.

799
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,720
Don't worry. I'm not

800
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,480
in a hurry.

801
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Mr. Jia, Mr. Jia,

802
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,640
Mr. Jia,

803
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,400
This is the first time I've heard about

804
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,759
the situation you mentioned.

805
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,319
The Gu Qiao I know,

806
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,839
is definitely not the kind of person you said.

807
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,160
If the situation is true,

808
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,039
I will give you

809
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,960
a satisfactory answer.

810
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,319
Okay.

811
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,480
I'll wait for your news.

812
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,279
But you don't have much time,

813
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,119
Xian Jia

814
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
Master, once it's broadcast live,

815
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,839
Shu Mei will be doomed.

816
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,119
Hello, Ge Ge,

817
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,279
Gu Qiao,

818
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,599
How's it going over there?

819
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,119
Mr. Wang

820
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,200
has been cheating on us.

821
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,720
But fortunately,

822
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
we got to Bai Xue's address.

823
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,559
Now we're on our way to her house.

824
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,960
Let's see if we can stop her.

825
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,680
Gu Qiao,

826
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,279
have you seen

827
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
a man called

828
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,519
"Turn right at the intersection ahead",

829
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,480
What did you just say?

830
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,680
It's nothing. You can go ahead.

831
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,440
Okay,

832
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,599
What's wrong?

833
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
It's okay to ask about the situation.

834
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,799
Master, at this time,

835
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,039
you still care about her feelings.

836
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,480
It can't be her.

837
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,319
Why hasn't she come out yet?

838
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,119
How long do we have to wait?

839
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,640
How long have you been waiting?

840
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,200
Are you also here to wait for Bai Xue?

841
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,799
Which media are you from?

842
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,160
From the media,

843
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,680
we've been waiting here

844
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
for a long time.

845
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,559
I didn't even make a sound.

846
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,400
He didn't respond or show up.

847
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,119
About the plagiarism,

848
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,240
it's probably true.

849
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,559
When will you be able to come out?

850
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,720
Who knows?

851
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,640
I didn't order takeout, either.

852
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,720
It's amazing, too.

853
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,200
Let's go back.

854
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160
You go back first.

855
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,000
I'll stay here.

856
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,160
I have to take responsibility for this.

857
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,039
So many people are guarding here.

858
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,720
What's the use

859
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,519
of staying here?

860
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,480
Let's go back.

861
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,559
Go back and have a look.

862
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,799
Any progress with Yuan Ge?

863
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,240
Let's go.

864
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,559
Mr. Yuan,

865
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,400
otherwise,

866
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,799
Let's just make a legal statement,

867
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,079
as a victim,

868
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,000
To denounce Bai Xue,

869
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,640
it's a big deal

870
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
that we just abandon Shu Mei,

871
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
At the very least, we can keep Li Juncheng alive.

872
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,920
Besides, the main purpose

873
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,119
of Guoman's marketing this time,

874
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,039
Just to save

875
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,039
Shumei's channel business

876
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
from the current situation,

877
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,119
Only a strong man can break his wrist.

878
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,240
Still no news

879
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
from Mr. Du?

880
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm sorry, Master.

881
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
Everyone, I have something to say.

882
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,920
In fact, Jia Long said this afternoon,

883
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,039
as long as we fire Gu Qiao,

884
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,319
He was willing to cancel the live broadcast.

885
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,359
And you can sit down

886
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,279
and negotiate with us,

887
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,039
Are you sure he said that?

888
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,000
Mr. Yuan,

889
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,799
the situation is so urgent,

890
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,839
Which is more important,

891
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,799
we hope you can seriously consider it.

892
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:52,839
That's right,

893
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,559
Mr. Yuan.

894
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,039
Things have come to this,

895
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,599
you can slow down the plan first.

896
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,400
There's nothing else we can do now.

897
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,960
That's all we can do.

898
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,599
Yeon-hee,

899
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,359
call Jia Long,

900
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,480
Okay.

901
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,039
Hey,

902
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,960
Mr. Jia,

903
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,400
I hereby announce

904
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,880
the dismissal of our employee Gu Qiao,

905
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,079
please cancel the live broadcast tonight.

906
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay,

907
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,400
I'll give you some more time.

908
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,559
You heard it.

909
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,920
Whether you're a cat crying or a mouse,

910
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,839
or throwing stones down a well?

911
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,680
You don't have to.

912
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,119
Master and I went to see Jia Long,

913
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,519
and we just said on the internet,

914
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,559
The person who Bai Xue plagiarized,

915
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,160
he pointed out,

916
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,119
The person in charge of this matter

917
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,119
must be fired,

918
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,880
That's you,

919
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,519
so between you and the company,

920
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,480
Master can only choose one.

921
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,599
Don't blame her.

922
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,799
It's her fault.

923
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,000
It's between her and me.

924
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,200
It has nothing to do with you.

925
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,400
Gu Qiao,

926
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,839
it's an emergency.

927
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,200
I really have no other choice.

928
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,640
Go home first.

929
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,200
I'll explain it to you later.

930
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,799
There's something fishy about it.

931
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,559
No need.

932
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
I know.

933
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,279
In your heart,

934
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,559
the company is the most important.

935
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,279
Master,

936
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,000
Jia Long called.

937
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,599
Master.

938
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,519
Hello, Mr. Jia.

939
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,279
It's only a few days.

940
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,480
So you came back.

941
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,480
Why are you so early today?

942
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,759
Uncle,

943
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,519
I have something to do.

944
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,400
She's still in the back.

945
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,840
You came back in advance.

946
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm telling you.

947
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,280
By the time I get married,

948
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,679
you must have become

949
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,880
the dominant female president,

950
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,320
Then we will

951
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,559
blossom together,

952
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
Go to the top of your life.

953
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,320
It makes me happy to think about it.

954
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,440
Can you sort them by color?

955
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,599
My clothes are all colored.

956
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,880
How do you divide it by color?

957
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,840
As long as it looks good.

958
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,320
Gu Qiao,

959
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,639
let me take the dishes,

960
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,440
I've cleaned it up for you.

961
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,599
Later,

962
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,000
you cook,

963
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,119
Uncle,

964
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,039
don't do it.

965
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:50,960
Let Ge Ge take you out

966
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,280
to eat later,

967
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,199
You,

968
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,519
What are you doing?

969
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,039
You're not eating at home anymore?

970
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,719
The company temporarily asked me

971
00:35:58,719 --> 00:35:59,920
to go to Beijing on business,

972
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
Business trip?

973
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,960
It's too sudden.

974
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,079
You didn't tell me.

975
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,559
Well,

976
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,280
How many days are you going?

977
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm not sure yet.

978
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,119
Are you leaving now?

979
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:12,960
It's

980
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,199
so late.

981
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,000
You won't be able to catch the high-speed train.

982
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,000
The company booked a flight ticket

983
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,639
for me. Uncle, I'm leaving now.

984
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,159
Goodbye.

985
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
The difference is too urgent.

986
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,239
Gosh,

987
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,880
Uncle,

988
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,519
Take care of yourself

989
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,519
at home alone.

990
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,920
And this song?

991
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,199
She's usually busy with work,

992
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,000
so don't always think she doesn't have time to accompany you.

993
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,039
I'm leaving now.

994
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,639
Don't worry.

995
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Okay, don't see me off.

996
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,639
Be careful.

997
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,280
-I'm leaving. -Bye.

998
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,880
Be careful.

999
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,440
Goodbye, uncle.

1000
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,239
Goodbye.

1001
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,199
Why are you in such a hurry?

1002
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,800
Gosh.

1003
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,639
Yuan Ge,

1004
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,599
you're just in time to come back.

1005
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,519
The noodles have just been cooked. Dad,

1006
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,079
where's Gu Qiao?

1007
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,239
Gu Qiao is on a business trip,

1008
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,079
don't you know?

1009
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:17,920
Yes.

1010
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,320
She went to Guangzhou

1011
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,159
on a business trip,

1012
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,760
She told me to go to Beijing,

1013
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,079
Yes.

1014
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,920
Go to Beijing first and then Guangzhou.

1015
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,880
What's the emergency in your company?

1016
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,679
It's so sudden to go on a business trip.

1017
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:47,920
The number you dialed?

1018
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,480
There's no answer for now.

1019
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Please redial later.

1020
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Sorry, the number you dialed

1021
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,400
is not available at the moment.

1022
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,679
But in the end,

1023
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,000
I did it to protect the company.

1024
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,039
I sacrificed her.

1025
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,199
I have no choice.

1026
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:40,920
I know.

1027
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,000
Gu Qiao will understand in the future.

1028
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,800
It's not that she doesn't understand.

1029
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
She's mad at me,

1030
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,639
Otherwise,

1031
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,559
she wouldn't be silent.

1032
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,880
So I moved out.

1033
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah,

1034
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,159
do you think with Gu Qiao's character,

1035
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
She just casually

1036
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,840
sent Jia Long's

1037
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
grandfather away,

1038
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,960
Of course not.

1039
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,599
If she had met Jia Long's grandfather,

1040
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,199
she would have told me.

1041
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Then do you think

1042
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,360
there's something strange about this.

1043
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,760
It's weird.

1044
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,559
But when Jia Long said that,

1045
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,280
I had to fire Gu Qiao first,

1046
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,079
So that we can find out the truth

1047
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,079
and buy time.

1048
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,039
Did you tell Gu Qiao

1049
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,280
these words?

1050
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,880
She won't answer my calls.

1051
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,519
You even turned off your phone.

1052
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,559
Tell me,

1053
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,239
she has no relatives in Shanghai for no reason,

1054
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,519
She didn't contact you.

1055
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,639
Where can she go?

1056
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,639
I'll give her a call.

1057
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,480
Hey,

1058
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,719
What are you doing?

1059
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,400
She told you that I ran away from home.

1060
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,400
You're not

1061
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,239
with her now.

1062
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,880
No.

1063
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,800
I'm alone outside.

1064
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,239
She told me on the phone.

1065
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
If you're my colleague,

1066
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,159
my old classmate,

1067
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,320
Come and offer me some sympathy.

1068
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,400
Then I'm grateful to you.

1069
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,920
But,

1070
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,719
if you're

1071
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,599
her lobbyist,

1072
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,480
You don't have to.

1073
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,599
What are you talking about?

1074
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
What lobbyist?

1075
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,159
Just say it to her,

1076
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,320
right?

1077
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,039
Why did you come to Shanghai?

1078
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,800
Isn't it just to help her?

1079
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,159
Not only did you help her,

1080
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,239
but you also took care of her food and daily life,

1081
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,400
Not only do you take care of

1082
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,320
her food and daily life,

1083
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,559
You even helped her fall in love?

1084
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,159
Besides, about Guoman,

1085
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,679
why did you do it?

1086
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,679
You just want to

1087
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,199
help Shu Mei increase her sales, right?

1088
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,559
But she doesn't

1089
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
care about anything.

1090
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,280
So I fired you.

1091
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,039
Who can stand it?

1092
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:02,800
Am I right?

1093
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,840
Even if you have any difficulties

1094
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
that you have no choice but to do,

1095
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,239
You can't do that either.

1096
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,960
You mean Yuan Ge?

1097
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe she has some reason

1098
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,639
that she has no other choice.

1099
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,840
I don't know.

1100
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,159
I heard

1101
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,320
Jia Long called,

1102
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,559
If you give me your real name,

1103
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:24,719
I'll fire you.

1104
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,280
But you haven't

1105
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,360
met him before.

1106
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,440
How could he call out your name

1107
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,679
with such certainty?

1108
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,840
Or have you been

1109
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,679
in contact before?

1110
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,599
If I had seen

1111
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,159
Jia Long before,

1112
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:35,840
As for the one who died

1113
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
in such an unaccountable way?

1114
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,480
Besides,

1115
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,880
this is Bai Xue's plagiarism,

1116
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,599
So should I sue Bai Xue

1117
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,639
What does it have to do with Shumei?

1118
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,079
Shumei is also a victim.

1119
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes, yes, yes. You're right.

1120
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,199
Calm down.

1121
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,480
I think this time,

1122
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,880
it may not be a bad thing.

1123
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,280
You can take this opportunity,

1124
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,519
take it as a little vacation,

1125
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,000
Have a good rest.

1126
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,039
Where do you want to go?

1127
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,519
Go relax.

1128
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,760
Leave the rest

1129
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,320
to Yuan Ge and me.

1130
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,480
You have to trust us.

1131
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,679
We will find out the truth

1132
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,760
for you,

1133
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:04,639
I don't need your help.

1134
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,440
I'm hanging up.

1135
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,840
What are you

1136
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,599
talking about?

1137
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,000
Why don't you ask her where she is?

1138
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,159
I just tried to persuade him to make peace.

1139
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,119
I forgot.

1140
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,280
Don't worry.

1141
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,800
She's a grown-up,

1142
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,440
she won't let herself sleep on the street.

1143
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,159
You're the one

1144
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,159
who's hungry,

1145
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,760
The most important thing for you right now,

1146
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,000
is to recharge your batteries,

1147
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,119
Let's go to see Jia Long tomorrow.

1148
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,239
Get to the bottom of this.
