1
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,120
Mr. Fu,

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,159
I have something to tell you,

3
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,239
I want to discuss with you,

4
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,920
you say,

5
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,359
Li Meng has plenty of supplies now.

6
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,799
If the supply is really in short supply,

7
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,359
we can also do some hunger marketing,

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,319
What about Zhou Shan?

9
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,400
What about Zhou Shan?

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,200
You don't need to bother.

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,959
As long as you

12
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,719
put 100% of your energy

13
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,239
into Li Meng.

14
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,760
I trust you

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,040
100%.

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,480
That's why Li Juncheng

17
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,280
only allowed Cheng,

18
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,200
Don't lose.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,079
If Zhou Shan,

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
I really took back

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
all the fakes.

22
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,439
In terms of dozens of masks per box,

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,439
how much time will it take

24
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,360
to make up for the loss before.

25
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,919
In terms of the sales volume of Zhoushan,

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,639
in half a month,

27
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,719
If we increase

28
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,159
the production by 50%,

29
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,360
How about giving Li Meng

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
half a month more?

31
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,319
At least double the profit.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
That's it.

33
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,280
Bingwen,

34
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,520
I invite you back.

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,080
I appreciate your big picture.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,080
You know what?

37
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,159
You and Yuan Ge

38
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,360
are both excellent people.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,919
He's also someone I trust very much.

40
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,199
So I hope you two,

41
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,759
can work together,

42
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,199
Do a good job in the company.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,080
As for the fake goods,

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,520
I know what to do.

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,280
Okay,

46
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,120
Got it.

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,719
Get back to work.

48
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,800
Here comes the cake.

49
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,959
This is the cake Gu Qiao

50
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,240
and I

51
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,040
made together. Isn't it great?

52
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,959
Ling Ling is awesome.

53
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Miss Gu,

54
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,879
I didn't expect you to be so versatile.

55
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,439
I was wondering

56
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,199
if I couldn't

57
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,040
eat the cake today.

58
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,759
What is this little skill?

59
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Dad,

60
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,199
stop chatting.

61
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's eat the cake first.

62
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,639
Okay,

63
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,319
Let's light a candle first.

64
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,879
Okay?

65
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,040
Okay. Come on,

66
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
light it.

67
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Okay.

68
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,319
Let's sing a birthday song, okay?

69
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,959
Happy birthday to you!

70
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,759
Happy birthday to you!

71
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Happy birthday to you!

72
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,560
Happy birthday to you!

73
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,199
Make a wish!

74
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,879
Make a wish.

75
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,879
It's a promise.

76
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
So soon.

77
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,319
Then what wish did you make?

78
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,839
You can't tell anyone

79
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,519
your birthday wish.

80
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,120
Let's blow out the candles together.

81
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay,

82
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,800
One, two, three,

83
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,519
wait.

84
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,199
Sister went to get

85
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,120
a period. Don't you expect it?

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,639
I'm not looking forward to

87
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,639
your birthday present.

88
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,600
It's so beautiful.

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,759
Guess what it is?

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,040
It's a paintbrush,

91
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,839
then Gu Qiao

92
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,600
will accompany Ling Ling

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,079
to draw lots and lots of paintings.

94
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,759
Of course.

95
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Thank you, sister.

96
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,040
Dad,

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,199
what birthday gift

98
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,600
did you prepare for me?

99
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,399
Dad.

100
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,720
What is it?

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Open it yourself.

102
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
The sunflower

103
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,120
is the sunflower

104
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,920
I drew with Gu Qiao,

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,560
Yes,

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
I'll put it on for you, okay?

107
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,480
Okay.

108
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Come on.

109
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,399
Come on,

110
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,039
Good boy.

111
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,240
Okay.

112
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
It's so pretty.

113
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,039
So what you're saying is,

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,559
you were persuaded by Mr. Fu.

115
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm not trying to convince him.

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I think

117
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,279
you're taking it too seriously.

118
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,799
What should we do?

119
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,639
I've already done it.

120
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,799
And those people

121
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,039
did buy fake goods

122
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,200
because they were greedy for petty gain.

123
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
When Mr. Fu talked to me,

124
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,519
I also thought about it.

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,960
I don't totally agree with her.

126
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,519
But if I were her,

127
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm afraid I would do the same.

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,399
After all, no company

129
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,159
is perfect.

130
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,480
I know.

131
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,279
If you're worried about Shumei's reputation,

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,759
let's use PR

133
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,600
to save some of it later.

134
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,159
Du Bingwen,

135
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,919
do you have any idea

136
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,919
what I'm insisting on?

137
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,360
Hey,

138
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,639
Yes.

139
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,519
Zhou Tian

140
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
It's settled, isn't it?

141
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay,

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,639
Have you set the exact time?

143
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,120
Sir,

144
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,679
could you please keep your voice down?

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,039
Fine, fine,

146
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,600
Okay,

147
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,840
I got it. I got it.

148
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,559
Can you keep your voice down?

149
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,879
It's affecting the others.

150
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,200
Everyone else is fine.

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,279
You're the only one

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,559
who's troubled. How can you say that?

153
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
That's what I said.

154
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,799
Forget it.

155
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,559
What? Forget it?

156
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm hanging up. I'll talk to you later.

157
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,360
Lower your voice, both of you.

158
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
It's affecting other people's watching movies.

159
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,320
What are you doing?

160
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,480
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,720
Excuse me,

162
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,320
can you lower your voice?

163
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,399
We're watching a movie.

164
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,799
If you don't look at others, why are you still looking at them?

165
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,320
There's no quality. This kind of person

166
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,559
has no quality,

167
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,480
Yes.

168
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,840
Go out and quarrel with this place.

169
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,120
It's really

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,240
… Let's go somewhere else for a

171
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
while.

172
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,080
About Zhou Shan's case,

173
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
it seems that we can't recycle

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,519
fake goods at all.

175
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,679
But in fact,

176
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,120
all consumers who buy fakes,

177
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,320
will find out our Shumei's inaction

178
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,679
on this matter,

179
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
By then,

180
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,120
our reputation will spread,

181
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
It must be

182
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
far more affected

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
than we can

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,799
imagine now,

185
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,440
And once the local dealers

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,080
find out,

187
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Our reputation has declined.

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,840
You'll lose faith

189
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,759
in us.

190
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,080
Didn't we agree

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,960
not to talk about work outside the company?

192
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,600
Let me take you home.

193
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,279
Where are you?

194
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,919
I'm starving.

195
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,320
Come back now.

196
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,039
Which one do you like?

197
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,120
I used to shine my heart on the moon,

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,440
but the moon shines on the bear.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
Mr. Xiong, thank you.

200
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Please take me home every time.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
I should thank you.

202
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,519
Ever since Ling Ling's mother

203
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,320
left,

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,279
The child is becoming more and more introverted.

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,720
He doesn't even want to talk to me.

206
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,399
Not to mention playing around.

207
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,240
So, I have to thank you

208
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,440
for everything.

209
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,919
Don't be polite to me,

210
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,120
you've helped me a lot too.

211
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,080
By the way,

212
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,360
this is for you.

213
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,200
Open it.

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,399
Well,

215
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
in order to thank you for taking the time

216
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
to celebrate Ling Ling's birthday with her,

217
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,279
even if

218
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,360
This is a small memento

219
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
for you.

220
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,440
Mr. Xiong, you don't have to think

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,759
too much about me, Miss Gu.

222
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,440
I think,

223
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,480
you and Ling Ling

224
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,559
have been getting along very well recently.

225
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
So I want to give you

226
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,559
the same money chain,

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,639
What do you think?

228
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,840
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

229
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,399
You're welcome.

230
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Mr. Du,

231
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,840
Mr. Xiong,

232
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,720
Mr. Xiong,

233
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,600
I'll go upstairs first.

234
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,919
Okay,

235
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
Ge Ge, are you leaving?

236
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,200
I'll go upstairs first.

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,840
Go to bed early.

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,279
Goodbye.

239
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,840
Ge Ge,

240
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,600
Mr. Xiong,

241
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,720
-Hello. -Hello.

242
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
Long time no see. Long time no see.

243
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
Can Li Juncheng gain a foothold in China?

244
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm counting on your Guangke.

245
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,799
That's what I should do.

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
When Mr. Yuan came to me,

247
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,720
he emphasized

248
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
the importance of Li Juncheng to Shumei,

249
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Since I take this order,

250
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,879
I will do my best.

251
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Gu Qiao,

252
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,720
come out.

253
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,759
I have something to tell you.

254
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,480
Come here.

255
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,639
It's so late. Why are you still up?

256
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,759
Sit down.

257
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,759
Sitting so far away,

258
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,879
are you afraid of me?

259
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,879
Did you do something wrong?

260
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,360
I didn't do anything wrong.

261
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,240
It's because you're too murderous,

262
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,960
being a tutor these days,

263
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,039
I can eat

264
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,919
with my parents,

265
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
You even sent them to me.

266
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,399
I'm telling you,

267
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,639
don't be so weird,

268
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,159
Xiong Qiming and I have nothing to do with each other,

269
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,080
why are you so guilty?

270
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm giving way to you.

271
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,519
I don't want to quarrel with you.

272
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,360
Look at your face.

273
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
How smelly is your face?

274
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,840
You must have quarreled with Second Brother Du,

275
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
and you blamed it on me.

276
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
Don't interrupt me.

277
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,759
Gu Qiao,

278
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,360
let me tell you one more time,

279
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,600
Xiong Qiming and you are not suitable for each other.

280
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,600
I've seen a lot of businessmen

281
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,639
like him,

282
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,159
Those who can sit in that position,

283
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,279
are not ordinary people.

284
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,720
That means he's good.

285
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,480
A powerful person

286
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
can be your enemy,

287
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,759
You can be your boss,

288
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,559
you can even be

289
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,639
your role model in the workplace,

290
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
But it's not suitable

291
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,879
to be your friend now.

292
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,399
Why can't we be friends?

293
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,360
I can't

294
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
have an elite friend.

295
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,519
Xiong Qiming is

296
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,799
a calculating person,

297
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Think about it,

298
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,600
why would he be friends

299
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,159
with one of Shumei's employees

300
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,000
for no reason?

301
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Thank you for reminding me,

302
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,960
I'm just a small employee

303
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,839
of Shumei,

304
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,440
Are you done?

305
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,039
I'll go to bed after that.

306
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,640
Do you understand?

307
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
What am I talking to you about?

308
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,799
I'm really worried about you.

309
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,319
Okay, I know.

310
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
I know what to do.

311
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,880
Stop talking about me.

312
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,200
Tell me about you and Du Bingwen.

313
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,519
He's already downstairs.

314
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,000
Why don't you ask someone

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,839
to come up and sit down.

316
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,079
Don't mention him.

317
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,759
You have to compete with me.

318
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,839
We really had a fight.

319
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,960
But from what I know about you two,

320
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,279
you must be the one who's stronger.

321
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,920
Which side are you on?

322
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Who makes sense?

323
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Who should I stand for?

324
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Do you know what happened?

325
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,039
He's the only one who makes sense.

326
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,839
You can drink while you're drunk,

327
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,839
and you don't eat,

328
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,720
I didn't sleep at all.

329
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,759
Drinking away your worries?

330
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,119
You're good at drinking.

331
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:26,960
Choose expensive drinks.

332
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,240
Let's eat.

333
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,400
What did I buy

334
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,720
because I couldn't find the right wine?

335
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,319
Du Bingwen,

336
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,680
hamburger again,

337
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,599
You're keeping a low profile

338
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,039
on me.

339
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,960
I want to be high-profile to you.

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,559
Do you deserve it?

341
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,599
Do you know how to chat?

342
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
With such low EQ,

343
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,799
ever since you came to my house,

344
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,240
Eat my food, drink my food,

345
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,400
live my flowers, wear my clothes.

346
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,039
You even piss me off once a day.

347
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,079
It's not the way to go on like this.

348
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
One of us must die.

349
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
If you say that,

350
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,920
I'll have to argue with you.

351
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,559
Did I just eat and drink for free?

352
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,200
If you're in a bad mood,

353
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,279
I'll chat with you,

354
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,079
If your relationship is frustrated,

355
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,279
I'll give you some advice.

356
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,200
You keep your boudoir alone?

357
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
I'll be alone with you.

358
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,799
I comfort you every day.

359
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,119
To enlighten you.

360
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,960
At least you got

361
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,920
a beautiful girl.

362
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,039
I didn't catch anything.

363
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,119
How can you

364
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,759
speak ill of me?

365
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,519
Besides not being willing

366
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,119
to put you to death,

367
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,799
Other ways to die,

368
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,759
I'm thinking about it.

369
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,039
Courtesy,

370
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,039
I know.

371
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,240
I was wrong.

372
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,759
Ge Zi.

373
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,279
Mei,

374
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,359
stomach warming tea,

375
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
You're the sweetest to me.

376
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,720
You have a bad stomach.

377
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,759
You need to take good care of yourself.

378
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,759
By the way, Ge Zi,

379
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,279
for the sake of Li Meng,

380
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,119
I didn't agree with

381
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,039
the fake recycling thing you said,

382
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,680
Will you blame me?

383
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,519
Mei,

384
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,839
I'm worried,

385
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,880
If we don't do this,

386
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,200
Shumei will be in trouble.

387
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,559
Of course I know that.

388
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,920
You must

389
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,160
care more about Shu Mei's reputation

390
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,880
than anyone else,

391
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,279
But as you know,

392
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
the company is getting bigger,

393
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,839
In fact, it's hard to cover everything.

394
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Especially at this

395
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,599
critical moment,

396
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
I hope you can understand me.

397
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,680
You know,

398
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,759
with you by my side,

399
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,440
I'm the most down-to-earth.

400
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,359
Because the two of us,

401
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,960
we will have a long way to go.

402
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,440
So we have to work together.

403
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,640
I got it.

404
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,319
Mr. Fu.

405
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,599
Come in,

406
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,319
Master,

407
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,799
this is the performance report for this month.

408
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,599
Take a look.

409
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,519
Let's discuss it at the meeting later.

410
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
I suggest you take a look first.

411
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,440
If not, don't discuss this.

412
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,640
What's going on?

413
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,160
The publicity programs and resources of Guangke,

414
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,799
are indeed top-notch in the industry.

415
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,079
However,

416
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
it seems that they only care about Li Meng.

417
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,119
The publicity for Shu Mei

418
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,119
is perfunctory,

419
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,000
Besides, Gu Qiao

420
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,599
has always been in charge of this.

421
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,480
She's new here,

422
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,079
so it's normal that she has no experience.

423
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,440
However,

424
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
ever since my colleagues found out,

425
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,200
Since you and she were close friends,

426
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,960
she has been under a lot of pressure.

427
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm just afraid that in the meeting later,

428
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,400
in case you're

429
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,279
in front of all departments,

430
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,319
If she criticizes Gu Qiao,

431
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,759
she will be embarrassed.

432
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,880
Got it.

433
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,759
Let's call everyone for a meeting.

434
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,680
Yes

435
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,160
After the fake goods incident in Zhoushan,

436
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,759
we also strengthened

437
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,680
the internal sampling inspection procedures,

438
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,440
So far,

439
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,359
there should be

440
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,039
no more fakes on the market.

441
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,559
should

442
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm sure there won't be any fakes.

443
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,039
How is the docking of Guangke going?

444
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,440
It's going well.

445
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,960
The resources they gave us are very good,

446
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
especially for the new media,

447
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,599
I got some more

448
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,359
tuba sizes myself,

449
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,599
To promote Shu Mei.

450
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
But how did I hear that

451
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,519
the resources you fought for,

452
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,480
Not only did she not

453
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,880
do any drainage for Shu Mei,

454
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,319
Instead, it has attracted ridicule

455
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,359
from some netizens,

456
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
She said that our Shu Meiren is stupid and rich,

457
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,920
and she doesn't even understand

458
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,599
the principle of accurate delivery.

459
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200
I used to do the delivery

460
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
according to the plan.

461
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,279
But Manager Zheng told me,

462
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,440
Shumei and Li Meng's investment ratio

463
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,400
will be out of balance.

464
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,079
So I made some adjustments.

465
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,079
Miss Gu,

466
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,799
I was just saying,

467
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,680
Our new media commercial

468
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,799
hasn't been updated for a long time.

469
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,599
What you said back then was,

470
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,240
Gu Qiao,

471
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,119
I also depend on my performance for a living.

472
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,519
If the publicity is wrong,

473
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,519
it will lead to a decline in performance.

474
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,599
I'm jointly and severally liable.

475
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,559
Then I won't lift a rock

476
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
and hit myself in the foot, will I?

477
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,920
So what you're saying is,

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,160
I made my own decision,

479
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,599
Gu Qiao, don't get excited

480
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,559
about your work.

481
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,839
When mistakes happen,

482
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,119
let's have a meeting today,

483
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,440
It's also to focus on finding problems.

484
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
And solve the problem.

485
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,640
Indeed,

486
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,799
it was my mistake at work.

487
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,519
I'll find a way to make it up to you.

488
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,599
But Jeong Yeon Hee

489
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
has something you haven't said.

490
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
You know it well.

491
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,000
All right,

492
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,359
If you make mistakes in your work,

493
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,160
you have to be brave enough to take responsibility.

494
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,319
Even if Jeong Yeon Hee

495
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,359
did say something?

496
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,680
You're the matchmaker of this project,

497
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,480
don't you have

498
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,559
your own judgement?

499
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,839
Here's the thing,

500
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,079
the publicity form of Guangke at that time,

501
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,960
Gu Qiao sent it to me.

502
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,559
I read it.

503
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
I personally signed and confirmed it.

504
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,279
But when she was busy with Li Jingzhi's business,

505
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,160
she might have neglected it.

506
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,400
It's my fault.

507
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,519
Mr. Du,

508
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,000
you do have

509
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,160
an unshirkable responsibility.

510
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,240
As a department leader,

511
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
you should know how to pick and choose people,

512
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,200
If Gu Qiao

513
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,880
is not capable enough

514
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
for this job,

515
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,759
I advise you not to encourage him,

516
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,799
Mr. Yuan is right,

517
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,440
I was wrong.

518
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,839
Gu Qiao,

519
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,440
you just came to the company,

520
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,559
This mistake,

521
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,799
even if it's a verbal warning,

522
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,160
I hope that

523
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,519
in your next job,

524
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,759
You can be more meticulous

525
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
and professional.

526
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,480
If you make

527
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,920
such a stupid mistake again,

528
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,119
I think

529
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,359
you can find another job.

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The meeting continues.

531
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:23,920
Gu Qiao,

532
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,079
take a look at this plan.

533
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,680
Is it OK?

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If it's possible,

535
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,599
I'll arrange for them to carry it out.

536
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,559
Or you need to go back first.

537
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,759
Report to the leader again.

538
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,599
You can make a decision

539
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,559
to be on the safe side,

540
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,160
I'd better go back

541
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,440
and check with the leader.

542
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,559
Okay,

543
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,839
Let's call it a day.

544
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,079
Sherry,

545
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,680
there's one thing,

546
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,799
I'd like to ask you to help me.

547
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,119
What is it?

548
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,000
Last time, about Li Junfang's delivery,

549
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,119
I've told you about that,

550
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,279
I even sent you an email.

551
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:54,960
Indeed,

552
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,559
I don't mean to blame you.

553
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm to blame for this.

554
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
So I made

555
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,000
a new plan,

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,680
What about all

557
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,839
the marketing numbers in it?

558
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,720
I've checked them one by one.

559
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,279
I'm just asking you

560
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,720
to help me push it again.

561
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
Push it again.

562
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,799
It also costs a lot.

563
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,680
This is the internal communication of your company,

564
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,720
and there is a problem.

565
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,799
We shouldn't

566
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,920
take the responsibility.

567
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,519
It's all my fault.

568
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,400
But don't we have

569
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,079
a deep cooperation now?

570
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,720
So I'm sorry to trouble you.

571
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,640
I promise.

572
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,200
It won't happen again.

573
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,240
Okay,

574
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,559
thank you.

575
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,559
Mr. Xiong,

576
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
Shumei said,

577
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
How to attach importance

578
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,359
to cooperation with us,

579
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,799
And he sent a new guy

580
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,880
who doesn't understand at all,

581
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,960
Come and connect with us.

582
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,119
In the end, it's still us who will take the blame.

583
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,759
I know

584
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,759
what happened.

585
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,319
Which Party A we've worked with

586
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:07,920
is easy to deal with?

587
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,640
What Shumei does is their business.

588
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,640
My request is,

589
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
Guangke can't make any mistakes,

590
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,279
I won't approve the publicity fee

591
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,119
for this month.

592
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,279
Figure it out yourself.

593
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,720
Mr. Xiong,

594
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,200
and,

595
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,200
Miss Gu is Party A's representative,

596
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,559
please pay attention.

597
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,559
I know

598
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,440
your working attitude.

599
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,599
Go ahead.

600
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,319
Gu Qiao,

601
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,519
you scared me.

602
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
If you don't do something wrong,

603
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
how could I scare you?

604
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,880
Stop!

605
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,480
Can I help you?

606
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,720
Come to the rooftop.

607
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,119
Miss Gu Qiao,

608
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,000
the company can't say anything.

609
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,559
Your master is not here.

610
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
Stop acting.

611
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,519
Tell me.

612
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,559
Why did you hurt me?

613
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
You're in charge of the docking,

614
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,720
and it's up to you to decide,

615
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,839
You're still acting

616
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,720
because of me, right?

617
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,880
You did not hesitate to harm the interests of the company,

618
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,720
just to harm me,

619
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
What do you dislike about me?

620
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,880
I don't like anything about you.

621
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,720
Now that you've made it clear,

622
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
I won't keep it a secret.

623
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,440
How many years have you been a rich wife?

624
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,920
I was kicked by a man.

625
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,200
So I came to take refuge in my master.

626
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,839
Eat her food, live her food and use her food.

627
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,640
She even needs to

628
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
take care of her work now.

629
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
Do you think all of this

630
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,960
is taken for granted.

631
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,359
Do you know

632
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,400
how my master

633
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,359
made it through all these years?

634
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,720
Do you know the days when she lived on the sofa

635
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,240
in order to save rent?

636
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,799
Do you know that in order to save her budget,

637
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,839
she went to drink with an advertising agency

638
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,119
and suffered stomach bleeding?

639
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,160
How can you enjoy your success

640
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,119
just by saying "good sister"?

641
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,000
So it's because I'm jealous.

642
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,200
Yuan Ge is your master?

643
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,960
She's also my best friend.

644
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,359
So ever since I joined the company,

645
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,559
I've always regarded you

646
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,359
as one of my own,

647
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,319
I didn't expect you

648
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,480
to do such a thing.

649
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay,

650
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,799
I'm in charge of this.

651
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,319
I admit it.

652
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,440
Jeong Yeon Hee,

653
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,480
let me give you a piece of advice,

654
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,599
If you really want to be good for your master,

655
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,960
then stop using

656
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,160
these little tricks

657
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,000
and take care of yourself.

658
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,319
I also advise you,

659
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,440
don't drag my master down anymore.

660
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,720
She has made exceptions

661
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
over and over again for you?

662
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,200
But what about you?

663
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,680
You want to be Mr. Du's assistant,

664
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,079
who do you think you are?

665
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,880
You.

666
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,359
It's just

667
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
a blood-sucking leech,

668
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,400
Without my master,

669
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,079
you are nothing.

670
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,920
I can't do anything.

671
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,119
Since you want to get to the bottom of this,

672
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,559
just pretend I didn't say it.

673
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,240
This Zheng

674
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,000
doesn't look like him.

675
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,160
Such a thoughtful person,

676
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,839
you mean,

677
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,759
I framed her up.

678
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,720
Don't be so excited without you.

679
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm just saying that

680
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,720
looking at your women's hearts,

681
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,519
It's really a needle in the sea.

682
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,319
It's them, not me.

683
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,519
I've known her for more than ten years,

684
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,279
but Yuan Ge doesn't believe me?

685
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,440
I don't think you should blame Yuan Ge.

686
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,759
What about her?

687
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,279
I was protecting you just now.

688
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,599
In the workplace,

689
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,199
we usually only look at the results,

690
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,440
What about you?

691
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,559
You seem to have done something wrong.

692
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,360
If she doesn't say a few words to you,

693
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,440
others will gossip.

694
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,920
Am I right?

695
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,360
Yes, she can talk about me,

696
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,000
but at least,

697
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,320
She needs to know the situation first.

698
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,519
Get to know the truth.

699
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,679
So you didn't feel ashamed

700
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,280
because you were scolded in public.

701
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,639
It's her fault that she doesn't believe you.

702
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm telling you,

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,119
when Yuan Ge was working,

704
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,880
It's like this. You don't recognize

705
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,119
any of your relatives.

706
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,679
You don't know that

707
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,639
the last time I worked with her,

708
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,280
I wonder

709
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,480
if she and I are classmates?

710
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,119
Why do you have no feelings at all?

711
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:38,840
Du Bingwen,

712
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,599
I can say that she,

713
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,599
You can't blame her.

714
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,880
What are you going to do?

715
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,599
I want to prove it to them

716
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,960
with my ability.

717
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,920
As it happens,

718
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,559
I'm planning to do a training

719
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,679
on Li's knowledge in the company,

720
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,199
Are you going or not?

721
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay,

722
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:57,800
I'll go.

723
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,360
Mr. Du,

724
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,400
what can I do for you?

725
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,719
I have a document

726
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,000
that I want Mr. Yuan to read.

727
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,480
I was wrong.

728
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,679
Please forgive me.

729
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,760
Mr. Du,

730
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,599
are you so free?

731
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,239
After a day and a night of reflection,

732
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,960
I deeply reflected on it.

733
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,159
It's my own fault,

734
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,360
I didn't fully realize

735
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,719
my girlfriend's merits,

736
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,440
She is

737
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,880
a very principled person.

738
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,119
Yes, that's right.

739
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,880
A mistake is a mistake.

740
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,679
This kind of quality

741
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,480
is very rare

742
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,280
in today's society.

743
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,239
I shouldn't just pursue it.

744
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,599
On the surface of peace,

745
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,840
there with mud.

746
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,519
When there were differences of opinion,

747
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,880
I didn't stand in her shoes

748
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,000
for the first time,

749
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Think about it.

750
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,320
She,

751
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,440
He's a tough guy on the outside and soft on the inside.

752
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:06,920
Knife mouth,

753
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,679
bean curd heart,

754
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,519
And I often because of

755
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,960
her tough side on the outside,

756
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,239
Ignoring her heart,

757
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,360
she needs to

758
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,639
be recognized.

759
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,920
I need to be praised.

760
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,199
A little girl who lacks security,

761
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:20,920
Yes.

762
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,320
That's the smile.

763
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm obsessed with it.

764
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,440
It's driving me crazy.

765
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I wish

766
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,320
you could smile more every day.

767
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,960
Do you know how beautiful you look

768
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
when you smile,

769
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,199
But I don't know why,

770
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,360
but I always make you angry.

771
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,400
I got it.

772
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,519
It should be because you care.

773
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,840
That's why you're like this.

774
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,239
So, from now on,

775
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,800
just throw tantrums at me.

776
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,760
Hit me,

777
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:57,760
scold me,

778
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,760
If you mess with me,

779
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,719
I'll take it

780
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,400
as a sign that you love me.

781
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,800
I promise you.

782
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,199
I will review myself in the future.

783
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,079
Okay?

784
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,239
Mr. Yuan,

785
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,480
there's a document

786
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
that needs your signature.

787
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,960
Okay, I'll see you

788
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,800
right away. Get out.

789
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,440
I'll read it later.

790
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,840
Okay.

791
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,119
I'm leaving.

792
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,960
I'm leaving.

793
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,400
Mr. Yuan,

794
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,719
there's nothing else.

795
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,519
I'm leaving too.

796
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,719
Get out.

797
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,079
Have you finished your weekly report?

798
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,159
Almost there.

799
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,920
Send me an email before you get off work.

800
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,599
I'll take you to skip work this afternoon.

801
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,559
I'm not in the mood to play

802
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,280
in the video game city.

803
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
I just don't think you're in the mood.

804
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,880
That's why I'm playing with you.

805
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,400
Childish.

806
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,400
Me.

807
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,760
Silly girl,

808
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,760
what did you say about me?

809
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,519
Come on!

810
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,599
Come on!

811
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,679
You're back.

812
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,440
Just in time.

813
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,400
I just left the front foot of the takeaway.

814
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,320
Come here.

815
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,079
Eat it while it's hot.

816
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm not hungry.

817
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Even if you want to be angry,

818
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,119
you can have a new baby after eating it.

819
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,039
Come on,

820
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,920
Come and have a seat.

821
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,199
Have some first.

822
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,559
I didn't want to say it,

823
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,039
but now that you say it,

824
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,599
Let's talk.

825
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,039
Tell me,

826
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,039
before the meeting,

827
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,000
Did Jeong Yeon Hee

828
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,079
report it to you in advance.

829
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,800
She told you that she meant well to remind you.

830
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,679
You believe her?

831
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,599
Let me tell you,

832
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,920
she dug a big hole for me.

833
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,760
You don't believe me?

834
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,000
Do you think she's more capable than me?

835
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,559
So he used this method

836
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,280
to frame me up,

837
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,320
Do you think I can't do anything?

838
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,679
Even if something goes wrong,

839
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,960
it's normal to throw the pot.

840
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,199
Am I right?

841
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,760
What I said today,

842
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,360
I did go too far.

843
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,440
I admit,

844
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,920
I've fallen behind a lot in the last few years,

845
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,519
But I've been working hard.

846
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,480
I won't be able to

847
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,599
eat into a fat man in one go,

848
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,199
Tell me,

849
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,679
if there's anything you don't understand at work,

850
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,639
You can ask her.

851
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:35,880
Yes.

852
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,960
I did.

853
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,920
But what did she do to me?

854
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,639
She dug a big hole for me.

855
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,400
Most importantly,

856
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,119
you chose to trust her?

857
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,679
Not me.

858
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,360
