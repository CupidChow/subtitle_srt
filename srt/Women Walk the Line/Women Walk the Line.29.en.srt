1
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
Mr. Xiong,

2
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,159
Mr. Xiong is here

3
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,479
to confess his love to Gu Qiao.

4
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,719
Mr. Xiong, you're here.

5
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,639
Gu Qiao,

6
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,439
happy birthday!

7
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

8
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,680
Cartier,

9
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,680
isn't Cartier normal?

10
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,800
This is a birthday present

11
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,719
I specially picked for you,

12
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
I hope you'll like it.

13
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
I'll accept the flowers

14
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,319
but I won't accept the gifts.

15
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,919
Thank you.

16
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,719
What gift?

17
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,639
Cartier,

18
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,360
Hao Shuai,

19
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,919
Could it be a diamond ring?

20
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,639
Sorry,

21
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,439
he's drunk.

22
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,080
It's okay. It's really

23
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,360
a diamond ring.

24
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,319
It's just a small one,

25
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,439
Hao Shuai.

26
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,039
It's such a small one.

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Who are you giving it to?

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,240
-It's so small. -No,

29
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,080
Well,

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,080
Hao Shuai,

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,039
why did you throw away the ring?

32
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,719
Du Bingwen,

33
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,879
let me tell you,

34
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,159
It's a bit smelly Money is amazing

35
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,159
Hao Shuai

36
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,800
Can you buy love if you let go of money?

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,159
Hao Shuai, stop it.

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,199
My cousin is drunk.

39
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,919
Who is it?

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,199
Let go of me!

41
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,319
Brother,

42
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,280
Tell me,

43
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,520
he only has a small diamond ring,

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,000
Excuse me,

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,199
will she like it?

46
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,599
Hao Shuai doesn't usually

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,800
do this. It's okay.

48
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,840
Today is your birthday,

49
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,360
happiness is the most important thing.

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
Happy birthday!

51
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,240
Mr. Xiong.

52
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,000
This gift.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,680
Gu Qiao,

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
I want to ask you a question,

55
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
In your heart,

56
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
apart from being Ling Ling's father,

57
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,240
And the boss of Guangke,

58
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,120
is there anything else?

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,759
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,120
That's not why I'm here today.

61
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,279
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

62
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,240
Just forget

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,639
what I just said.

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,120
Your friends are waiting for you.

65
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,519
Let's go in.

66
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,439
When I first came to Shanghai,

67
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,160
I was like

68
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,319
a drowning person.

69
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,560
I tried my best to hold on

70
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,839
to your life-saving straw,

71
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,879
You keep saying that you want to be independent,

72
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,519
to be

73
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,759
a strong woman like you,

74
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,480
But this time, I realized,

75
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,560
in this workplace,

76
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,639
It's not that easy.

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,079
So you're going to give up?

78
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,720
Of course not.

79
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,519
I'm getting more frustrated and braver now.

80
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,879
Especially after I moved out

81
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,839
and shared a room with someone else,

82
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
I have

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,959
a determination to bottom out.

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
If I

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
relied on you back then,

86
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,439
When I came to Shu Mei,

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,160
I wanted to be closer to you.

88
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,959
But now,

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm truly in love with Shu Mei.

90
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,879
I fell in love with this job.

91
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,560
I think you've changed a lot

92
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
in the past few days.

93
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,759
Yeah,

94
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,000
I should have known,

95
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,800
I should have moved out earlier.

96
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
What about Xiong Qiming?

97
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,720
He is so calm,

98
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,800
but he can be stirred up by Hao Shuai in a few words,

99
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,439
He should be sincere to you.

100
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,639
What do you think?

101
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
In my original plan,

102
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
I only had to work hard,

103
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,560
Working hard to make money,

104
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,000
these two tasks,

105
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,199
I thought,

106
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,879
I don't have confidence anymore.

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,759
I'm going to meet

108
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,720
a new relationship.

109
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,600
But in this relationship,

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
there's always

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
no way to control it.

112
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,440
Gu Qiao,

113
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,120
I hope,

114
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,279
You should use reason

115
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,559
to overcome sensibility.

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Don't worry.

117
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm no longer the "love brain"

118
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,919
Gu Qiao I used to be,

119
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,799
I know how to

120
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,039
deal with this matter.

121
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,519
Well,

122
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,440
if you think so,

123
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm happy for you.

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,240
Cheers!

125
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,759
Why?

126
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,559
Why can't you like me?

127
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,159
Why?

128
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,519
Why?

129
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,759
Why can't you like me?

130
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,720
Why don't you like it

131
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,279
Come in,

132
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,559
Mr. Yuan,

133
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,759
this document,

134
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,799
I need you to sign it.

135
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,840
Why did you increase the price by 20%?

136
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,279
Because of the extension of the contract,

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,759
the supplier

138
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,000
needs to increase the price by 20%,

139
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,200
Mr. Yuan,

140
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,320
let me make it clear.

141
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,759
It's really not that I'm gossiping

142
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,639
behind people's backs,

143
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,399
This contract,

144
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,559
I gave it to Mr. Liu early in the morning,

145
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,440
Ask her to review it.

146
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,519
And asked you to sign it.

147
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,519
I know she's busy now.

148
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,960
That's why I've been telling you.

149
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,919
But she still forgot about it.

150
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,919
As for the suppliers,

151
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,720
our company

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,519
hasn't made any moves.

153
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,759
So I sold the goods to other houses.

154
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,919
If we want to follow

155
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,960
the original production cycle,

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,720
In case of shipment,

157
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,240
they need to rush to work.

158
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,639
So I temporarily increased the price

159
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,879
by 20%.

160
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,120
It's not a small amount. Have you

161
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,039
asked other suppliers?

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,080
Yes, I did.

163
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,679
Their orders

164
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,240
have been scheduled

165
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,039
for a few months,

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,600
This is the only family.

167
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,240
Or because of

168
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,679
the long-term cooperation with our company,

169
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
That's why I'm willing to help.

170
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,120
Go back to your work.

171
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,600
I'll handle this contract.

172
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay,

173
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,120
By the way,

174
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,759
after Mr. Liu returned to the company,

175
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,360
Ask her to come to see me as soon as possible.

176
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
Got it.

177
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,080
Hello,

178
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,399
Hello,

179
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,159
Open the door for me.

180
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,559
Do you have an appointment?

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,480
No.

182
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,840
I used to work here,

183
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,000
so I came to see my old colleague today,

184
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
If you don't have an appointment,

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
outsiders

186
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
are not allowed to enter our company.

187
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,440
Didn't I just tell you?

188
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,639
I used to work here,

189
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,399
but now

190
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,440
you don't work here anymore.

191
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,159
Can I find someone?

192
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,000
Who are you looking for?

193
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,840
Gu Qiao.

194
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm sorry

195
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,360
I messed up your birthday party,

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,679
Me

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Really

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,080
I didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,879
It's okay.

200
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,000
I forgive you.

201
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,399
If I screw up your birthday party,

202
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,039
at least let me treat you

203
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,000
to a big meal,

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,039
Take it as compensation.

205
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,200
No need.

206
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,360
I have something else to do.

207
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,039
I'll go upstairs first.

208
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,600
Gu Qiao,

209
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,200
Xiong Qiming gave you a diamond ring,

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,159
Do you know

211
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,039
what it means

212
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,879
for a man to give a diamond ring to a woman?

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,720
I know.

214
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,360
Also,

215
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,759
I'm your brother.

216
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,159
And your future sister-in-law's friend,

217
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,600
talking about seniority,

218
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,600
From now on,

219
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,879
you should call me sister.

220
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,519
Mr. Liang,

221
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,919
thank you for your help this time.

222
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,360
Thank you for your team's rush.

223
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,399
Next time I go to Guangzhou,

224
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,440
I'll treat you to dinner.

225
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,039
Come in.

226
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Thank you so much.

227
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,200
I won't bother you then.

228
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Goodbye.

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Have a seat.

230
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Mr. Yuan,

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
regarding the contract,

232
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,559
I'm really sorry.

233
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,159
My child suddenly had a high fever,

234
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,519
so I was anxious to take her to the hospital,

235
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,679
Well,

236
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,039
I've found

237
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,000
a new supplier,

238
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
The price and delivery date

239
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,679
have been pushed forward

240
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,279
according to the original plan.

241
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
That's great.

242
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,720
Thanks to you this time.

243
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,360
Liu Min,

244
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
have you been

245
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,480
too busy lately,

246
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,159
If you're too busy,

247
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,200
you can rest for a while.

248
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,960
If I come to work again,

249
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
I'll be very busy.

250
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
I really,

251
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,159
Me,

252
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Like this kind of mistake, I … I really won't make it

253
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,759
again.

254
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,320
Did something

255
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,279
happen to you recently?

256
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,679
I think you've been feeling restless.

257
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,840
It's too hard to take care of the kids.

258
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,519
I remember you said before,

259
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,559
your mother-in-law is going to come to Shanghai to help.

260
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,519
Yes

261
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,399
My mother-in-law has been here for a few days,

262
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,240
not only can't help me much,

263
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,879
Both of us

264
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,840
have opposite opinions.

265
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,159
My husband

266
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:44,919
comforts my mother-in-law

267
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,759
and comforts me every day,

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,919
We suffered a lot every day,

269
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,799
and then we decided

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,480
to send my mother-in-law back to her hometown.

271
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,559
But unexpectedly,

272
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,480
my husband just came back from his hometown,

273
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,679
He was placed on the layoff list

274
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,679
by the company,

275
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,480
As you know,

276
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
Internet workers,

277
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,279
After the age of 35,

278
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,679
he started to decline.

279
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,440
He's under a lot of pressure right now.

280
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,440
I'm still struggling to start a business recently.

281
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,159
Me,

282
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,200
I really

283
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
can't bear to hurt his confidence

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,919
at this stage.

285
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,519
About your family,

286
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,360
I can't say anything.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,799
But the company has its rules,

288
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
so I helped you this time.

289
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,879
It doesn't mean you can be

290
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,039
so lucky every time.

291
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I know.

292
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Thank you so much this time.

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
But after what you said,

294
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,559
I can only tell you.

295
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
But,

296
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,480
Mr. Yuan,

297
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,840
Please

298
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,960
put in a good word with Mr. Fu.

299
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,080
I really can't

300
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,000
leave Shu Mei now,

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,799
My family's mortgage, car loan,

302
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,840
old people and children,

303
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
As for the monthly living expenses,

304
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,759
I'm the only one who's responsible for it.

305
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,279
Me

306
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
If I lose my job too,

307
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,879
OK, OK, Liu Min,

308
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
You're an old man in the company.

309
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,480
As for Mr. Fu,

310
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,799
I'll try my best to help you deal with it.

311
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,399
Okay?

312
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,320
Thank you.

313
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,559
But now

314
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,840
you're taking care of the baby alone,

315
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,720
You still need to support your family,

316
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,120
so I think you should have a good talk

317
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
with your husband.

318
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I can't put all the pressure

319
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,080
on you.

320
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Mr. Yuan,

321
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,559
I'll take care of everything.

322
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,480
Trust me.

323
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Why did you gather all of us here today?

324
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,600
There are two main things I want to say.

325
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,759
First,

326
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,399
I want to apologize to Xu Ling'er.

327
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,559
I did wrong

328
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,720
in that matter.

329
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,039
No matter what happens,

330
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,440
I shouldn't have hit him.

331
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,159
And as an anchor,

332
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,679
I know it's not easy for you.

333
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,279
If you need anything in the future,

334
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,559
you can tell me.

335
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,080
You can use my stuff. No,

336
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,919
no, no.

337
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,919
I should apologize first.

338
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,679
I was too nervous

339
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,919
that day.

340
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,840
I was afraid you'd blame me,

341
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,759
so,

342
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,720
Alright,

343
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,759
stop apologizing to each other.

344
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,440
Under the same roof,

345
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,000
it's hard to avoid bumps and bumps,

346
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,839
Let's talk about it today.

347
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,039
Gu Qiao,

348
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,319
what do you think is the second thing?

349
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,880
As you can see,

350
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,640
Wang Mei and I

351
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,400
came back early today.

352
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,799
So I cleaned up the living room.

353
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,599
It feels

354
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,480
different now.

355
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,839
It's a lot warmer.

356
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
You feel at home,

357
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,039
don't you?

358
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,160
So every day

359
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
when we actually get home,

360
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,079
The first thing I saw

361
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,319
was our living room,

362
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,400
If it's a mess,

363
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,960
we won't be happy either.

364
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,319
So I suggest,

365
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,400
we can clean up

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,799
the living room.

367
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,559
In this way,

368
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,960
I'll feel at home when I'm back.

369
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,559
Besides, we have a lot of people,

370
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,799
so we don't have much time

371
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,039
to clean it up,

372
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,359
What about the kitchen?

373
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,720
I'll clean it up as soon as possible.

374
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,559
We can cook,

375
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,720
and we can have dinner.

376
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
What do you think?

377
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,759
By the way,

378
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,759
the duty watch,

379
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,799
I've arranged it.

380
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,279
Six days per person per month.

381
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,559
Let's start with Gu Qiao,

382
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,039
Okay,

383
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,839
Did everyone agree?

384
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,680
I agree.

385
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,480
I agree.

386
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,799
Okay,

387
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,880
Then today's meeting

388
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,359
will be a complete success.

389
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,640
Have a good sleep.

390
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,359
Have a good dream.

391
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,039
Dismissed.

392
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,319
Good night.

393
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,119
Let me do it.

394
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,680
Ms. Liu,

395
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,720
about work,

396
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,119
You can rest assured if you leave it to me.

397
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,519
As for the details

398
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,279
that need to be docked,

399
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
Just send me

400
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
the email directly.

401
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:49,680
Okay,

402
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,480
I didn't expect

403
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,519
Mr. Liu

404
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,960
to accept the demotion

405
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,039
so calmly.

406
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
Isn't he still the director?

407
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,720
The amount of gold

408
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,640
between directors

409
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
is different.

410
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,680
And she's under the control

411
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
of her former subordinate,

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,079
It's embarrassing to think about it.

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,240
You're right.

414
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,599
Getting married and having children,

415
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,200
is really a threshold for a woman.

416
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Not necessarily.

417
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,519
It depends on who you are married to,

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,160
I finally know.

419
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Why did you go on blind dates

420
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,519
so many times,

421
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,759
She's not married yet.

422
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,960
I was just not going to make do with it.

423
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,319
Gu Qiao,

424
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,519
when did you and Mr. Xiong meet?

425
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,119
I've always wanted to ask you,

426
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,960
if you marry Mr. Xiong,

427
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,640
Then you don't have to

428
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,759
worry about anything.

429
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,440
I also think he's not bad.

430
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,240
You can think about it.

431
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,440
It doesn't matter what kind of person you marry.

432
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,200
What matters is,

433
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,519
What kind of person do you want to be?

434
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,640
What kind of person you want to be.

435
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,400
This is a good plan. It has

436
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,119
a multi-dimensional rectangular closed loop.

437
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,359
That's great.

438
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,880
Then let's follow

439
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,759
this plan.

440
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,240
Okay.

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,759
Sherry, wait a minute.

442
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:10,920
What's up?

443
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,279
The plan you proposed last time,

444
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:15,960
there's a flaw.

445
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,920
I've already marked it.

446
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,440
I sent it to you.

447
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,240
Take a look.

448
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,160
Really?

449
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:20,960
Let me have a look.

450
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,720
Sorry,

451
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,759
I didn't notice anything.

452
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,759
It's okay.

453
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,960
It's just some small details.

454
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,359
It's normal to ignore it.

455
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,960
These small details

456
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,279
are often the most important.

457
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,240
If you hadn't reminded me,

458
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
I'm afraid I wouldn't have found out.

459
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Thank you.

460
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,480
You're welcome.

461
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,160
All right,

462
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm going to revise it.

463
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,039
This is Shumei.

464
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,680
My sister is good.

465
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,599
Open the door for me.

466
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,720
Hello,

467
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
this is the business building,

468
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,000
You can either swipe your card

469
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,279
or make an appointment.

470
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,759
make an appointment

471
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,599
I need to make an appointment with my sister.

472
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,720
Who is your sister?

473
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,720
Gu Qiao

474
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,799
Yuan Ge, Shumei's vice president,

475
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,480
is also my sister.

476
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,599
You know Yuan Ge, right?

477
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,519
Yes,

478
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,240
Yes,

479
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,759
Open the door if you know him.

480
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
If you know him,

481
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,359
you can't get in without an appointment,

482
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,799
How about you make a phone call

483
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,440
and ask them to pick you up.

484
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:46,839
Okay,

485
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,599
I'll

486
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,759
call them now.

487
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Ask her to pick me up in person.

488
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,960
Please go over there

489
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
and wait for them in person.

490
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,720
This is the aisle. It's

491
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,160
blocking the road.

492
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,279
I'm sorry.

493
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,319
I don't think there's any problem in the future.

494
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,720
Maybe the front needs to be changed.

495
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,039
Okay. Thank you

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Sis,

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,039
Sister, I'm here.

498
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,319
Gu Liang,

499
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,559
why are you in Shanghai?

500
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,480
I'm looking for my sister,

501
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,720
so I came to see you.

502
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:03,799
By the way,

503
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
I brought you a lot of pickles

504
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,319
from my hometown,

505
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,720
You're welcome.

506
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
I don't usually cook by myself.

507
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,839
My mom said that

508
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,599
my sister is in Shanghai,

509
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,519
It's all up to you to take care of her.

510
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,279
You have to take it,

511
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:14,920
or else,

512
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,799
I can't explain it when I go back.

513
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,920
By the way,

514
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,000
isn't my sister in the company?

515
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,119
She has something to do.

516
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,480
I don't think he's going back to the company.

517
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,079
That's good.

518
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:24,920
I'll wait for you here.

519
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
When you get off work later,

520
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,039
I'll take your stuff back.

521
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,440
Let's cook a table of hometown dishes tonight,

522
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,240
then wait in my office.

523
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,119
Not here.

524
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,480
Let's go.

525
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,079
Okay,

526
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
Come on.

527
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,000
What?

528
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,440
Mr. Fu didn't even give me a chance

529
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,160
to negotiate.

530
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,720
So he turned it down.

531
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,960
It's useless for you to go out.

532
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,880
That's right.

533
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,559
No,

534
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,160
Qiming,

535
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,519
you really have to help me with this.

536
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,920
We are old friends.

537
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
As you know,

538
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,319
I just went to the US headquarters for a short time,

539
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,519
You're not seated yet.

540
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,000
So when it comes to acquiring Shumei,

541
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,200
I have to get it done.

542
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,000
David,

543
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,240
if you can help me,

544
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm very happy to be a grown-up.

545
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,440
Right now, Fu Mei

546
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
is full of confidence

547
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,319
in her business empire.

548
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,240
And Yuan Ge,

549
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,480
the vice president who has always

550
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,960
dreamed of being a national brand,

551
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,200
blocked the way to acquire Shumei,

552
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,359
It is indeed difficult.

553
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,039
I know it's hard.

554
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,799
It's not hard.

555
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,240
I won't come to you either.

556
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,880
Lixiang,

557
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,519
have you heard of Lixiang?

558
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,440
The development of domestic cosmetics

559
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,559
has mushroomed in recent years,

560
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,400
Where's Lixiang?

561
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,799
Imitating Shu Mei is the most successful.

562
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,119
No matter in terms of reputation or channels,

563
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,119
they are the best among the new brands.

564
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,839
David,

565
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,160
if you want,

566
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,519
I'm very happy to promote

567
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,880
your acquisition of

568
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,160
Lixiang Qiming. You know that,

569
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,079
This is an order

570
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:02,599
from the headquarters of Baolai Group,

571
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,720
It's about buying Shumei,

572
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,440
not anything else,

573
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,079
Don't you forget,

574
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,680
your Guangke Company,

575
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
With so many achievements every year,

576
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,720
our Baolai Group

577
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
has contributed a lot.

578
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,920
Yes,

579
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,759
I do,

580
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,960
As long as you're willing to do me this favor,

581
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,279
I'm sure it'll work.

582
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,839
Qiming,

583
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
Old Bear.

584
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,440
Have some coffee.

585
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm not in the mood to drink.

586
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,039
Mr. Xiong.

587
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,519
Why did you ask me out all of a sudden?

588
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,440
What is it?

589
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,440
At my birthday party that day,

590
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,759
Hao Shuai did something wrong,

591
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,799
Me

592
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,920
I want to apologize to you.

593
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,680
It's okay. It's all

594
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,759
in the past.

595
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,960
Don't worry about it.

596
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,319
And the other day,

597
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,559
you asked me,

598
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,960
In my heart, you.

599
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm sorry.

600
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,880
Sis,

601
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,359
I'm at Yuan's house.

602
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
We'll cook

603
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,599
and wait for you to come back for dinner.

604
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,640
It doesn't matter.

605
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,119
You can get back to work.

606
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,440
Let's meet again when we're free.

607
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,240
I'm really sorry.

608
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,279
I'll make an appointment another day.

609
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,039
Gu Qiao,

610
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,680
where's Gu Liang?

611
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,400
Sis,

612
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,279
You're back just in time.

613
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,079
Let's eat together.

614
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:20,720
Let's go.

615
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,440
Sis,

616
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,880
What are you doing?

617
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,000
We haven't eaten yet.

618
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,119
I don't live here anymore.

619
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,799
Don't disturb Yuan Ge from now on.

620
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
Where do you live?

621
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,759
It doesn't matter where I live.

622
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,160
Let's go.

623
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,240
Sister Gu Qiao,

624
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,319
finish your meal before you leave.

625
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,079
Gu Liang has been busy for a long time.

626
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,640
That's right.

627
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,920
He's not hungry, is he?

628
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:37,640
Let's go.

629
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Sister Gu Liang's

630
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,079
luggage and my shoes,

631
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,920
Take your stuff and go.

632
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,279
Yuan, we're leaving.

633
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
-Okay. -Done.

634
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,519
Thank you.

635
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,839
Done.

636
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Stay for one night and then leave.

637
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
Sis,

638
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,160
You misunderstood me.

639
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,519
I'm here for business.

640
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,480
What business can you have?

641
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,680
I'm running my own business,

642
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,559
Gu Liang,

643
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,839
Do you understand that you can do business?

644
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
Don't play games with me.

645
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm telling you,

646
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,759
I have to go back early tomorrow morning.

647
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,319
Sis,

648
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
You really misunderstood me.

649
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,920
I'm really here for business.

650
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,039
I came to see you by the way.

651
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,119
Sis,

652
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,319
I made money.

653
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,240
Really?

654
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,720
Didn't you

655
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,839
move out from Yuan's house?

656
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,079
The rent is quite high, isn't it?

657
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,599
I'll transfer you 10thousand. Ask me for it

658
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
if you don't have enough.

659
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,440
Where did you get so much money?

660
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,880
I did a little business with my friend.

661
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,599
I just earned a little,

662
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,200
but I'll earn more in the future.

663
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Take it.

664
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,559
I don't want it.

665
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,480
Keep it for yourself.

666
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,680
Save some flowers.

667
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,160
I know.

668
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,079
Are you saving them all?

669
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,559
It's mainly because my sister

670
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,880
has done so much for me before,

671
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,079
If I earn money,

672
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,039
I have to spend it for you first.

673
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,839
Sis,

674
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,279
Mom and dad are really worried about you.

675
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,400
He especially asked me

676
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,799
to come and see how you were doing.

677
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm fine.

678
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,079
Go back and take care of your parents,

679
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,799
Okay,

680
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
I won't bother you then.

681
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,759
By the way,

682
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,119
what time will you get off work tomorrow?

683
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,519
I'll treat you to dinner.

684
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,079
Let's talk about it tomorrow. Go upstairs.

685
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,519
Okay,

686
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,359
Then you should go back and rest early.

687
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,599
I'm going upstairs.

688
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,519
Goodbye.

689
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:41,960
Goodbye.

690
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,000
Go to bed early and don't play games.

691
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,799
Got it.

692
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,039
Hello,

693
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,839
I'm looking for Yuan Ge Mr. Yuan

694
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,160
Do you have an appointment?

695
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,039
I'm her friend.

696
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,640
I told her.

697
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,039
Okay,

698
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,039
This way, please.

699
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,119
Mr. Yuan's office is this way.

700
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,799
Who is this?

701
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,240
Mr. Yuan is quite efficient.

702
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,319
Just after breaking up with Mr. Du,

703
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,279
someone came to deliver food.

704
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,200
I don't think

705
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,279
he's as rude as Mr. Du

706
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,000
in there,

707
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,039
In terms of face value and temperament,

708
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,759
you're so different from Mr. Du.

709
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
My mom said,

710
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,200
about what happened last time,

711
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,799
Thank you so much.

712
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,559
So she made

713
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,640
dumplings herself,

714
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,720
Let me bring it to you.

715
00:30:58,759 --> 00:30:59,640
I heated it downstairs.

716
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,559
Eat it while it's hot.

717
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,359
Thank you.

718
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,759
Me

719
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,920
We'll eat later.

720
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
How have you been?

721
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,599
Are you still taking medicine?

722
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,799
I'm fine recently.

723
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,960
I haven't eaten for days.

724
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,799
Speaking of which,

725
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,920
thanks to you.

726
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,599
I'm used to it.

727
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,039
Being someone else's listener,

728
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,519
it's like I don't

729
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,559
have any worries,

730
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Thanks to you.

731
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
You're willing to listen to me talking about this shit,

732
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,240
and,

733
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,359
even if

734
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,400
You know,

735
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,599
the bad side of me,

736
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,039
You didn't look down on me because of that.

737
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,960
Sun Bin,

738
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,759
don't say that.

739
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,839
We are friends.

740
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,440
I don't think you should care too much

741
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,519
about other people's opinions,

742
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,880
Especially in front of Auntie,

743
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,880
try not to be brave.

744
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,039
Talk to her more,

745
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
and let her know your difficulties.

746
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,480
Maybe I wouldn't have

747
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,680
put you in such a difficult situation.

748
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,920
Okay,

749
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,240
I'll try to communicate with her.

750
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,079
Just eat.

751
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
I'll get going.

752
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
I won't bother you anymore.

753
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,039
See you later.

754
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,279
See you later.

755
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,119
Thank you.

756
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,559
Hey,

757
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,279
What do you want for lunch?

758
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,440
I'll buy it for you.

759
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,599
No need.

760
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,599
I have dumplings here.

761
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,880
Dumplings,

762
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,079
I love dumplings the most.

763
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,880
Really?

764
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,680
How about I keep it for you?

765
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,160
Come to my house for dinner tonight

766
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:46,839
Okay,

767
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,559
Keep it

768
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,079
Don't eat any of them.

769
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,759
Gu Qiao,

770
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,839
Mr. Xiong,

771
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,079
Why are you here?

772
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,880
I happen to have something to do nearby.

773
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,400
Didn't you

774
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,480
have something to tell me yesterday?

775
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
Why don't we have dinner together?

776
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,400
Let's talk over dinner,

777
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,000
okay?

778
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,960
Let's go.

779
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,559
Let's go.

780
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:16,799
Sis,

781
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,599
Sis,

782
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:18,839
Sis,

783
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,960
Are you off work?

784
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,200
I'm waiting for you to have dinner with me.

785
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
Is this your friend?

786
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,240
Hello,

787
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,279
Hello,

788
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm Gu Qiao's friend,

789
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,039
Xiong Qiming,

790
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,559
I'm Gu Qiao's brother,

791
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,000
Gu Liang,

792
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,480
Hello.

793
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,279
Well,

794
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,960
I just stopped by the company.

795
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,839
It depends on my sister.

796
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,480
If you have something else to do,

797
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,359
you can go back to work.

798
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:44,480
Okay,

799
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,160
It's nothing.

800
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,720
We're going to eat.

801
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,079
If you don't mind,

802
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:48,799
let's go together.

803
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,559
Good for you.

804
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,559
I'm sorry,

805
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,799
my brother is like this,

806
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,640
It's okay.

807
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,400
Let's go.

808
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,799
Come on.

809
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,360
Sister, have some too.

810
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,559
Come on,

811
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,440
Thank you.

812
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,719
I'll peel some more for you.

813
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,320
I can do it myself.

814
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,880
Thank you.

815
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,599
I'm fine.

816
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,599
Well,

817
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,519
you're my sister's friend, right?

818
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,199
Then I'll call you Brother Sheng.

819
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,519
Brother, do you drink?

820
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,440
Would you like a bottle?

821
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,800
Gu Liang,

822
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,960
I'll drive.

823
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,599
You can drink it.

824
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,400
Waiter,

825
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,639
hello, Mr. Xiong.

826
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,800
Please bring me my wine.

827
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,679
No need.

828
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,400
If he doesn't drink it,

829
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,119
no one will drink it anyway.

830
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,719
Go ahead.

831
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,440
Okay.

832
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,000
This dish is quite delicious.

833
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's very fresh.

834
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,480
You should eat more, too.

835
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,280
Gu Liang

836
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
Eat more if you like.

837
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,559
You didn't eat much.

838
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,199
Thank you.

839
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,559
Mr. Xiong,

840
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,039
your wine,

841
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,559
Here comes the wine.

842
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Enjoy your meal.

843
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:25,840
Pour it yourself.

844
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,159
Brother,

845
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,199
Let me propose a toast to you

846
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:35,960
when we meet for the first time.

847
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,280
Just drink some water.

848
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,880
Okay

849
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,679
Sis, do you want

850
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,639
some wine? It's okay.

851
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,000
The degree is a little low.

852
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,079
My dad's Erguotou is more exciting.

853
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,599
I can't shut your mouth even if I eat.

854
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,880
Come on,

855
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,320
Thank you.

856
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,440
Brother,

857
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,559
How long have you known my sister?

858
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
About half a year ago.

859
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,599
Time flies.

860
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,440
No wonder when I first

861
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,159
saw you,

862
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,639
I think we really hit it off.

863
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,119
Don't tell me,

864
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,239
from this point of view,

865
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,119
You two

866
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,679
are quite like husband and wife.

867
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,960
Gu Liang, come out!

868
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,960
Brother, I'll add you on WeChat.

869
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,079
Me,

870
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:45,360
WeChat,

871
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,840
let me scan you.

872
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,360
Gu Liang

873
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,199
Sister, this is a public place.

874
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:49,960
Watch out for Gu Liang.

875
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,639
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

876
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,079
It's okay. Add it.

877
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,360
Sister.

878
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,840
Sis,

879
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,239
Sis,

880
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,360
Sis,

881
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,480
Sister, what are you doing?

882
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,199
I'll buy a ticket to take you home.

883
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,679
Sister, don't be like this.

884
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,280
Like I said,

885
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm here to see

886
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
if you're doing well?

887
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,239
I'll go back after two days.

888
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,960
As long as you don't come,

889
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,679
I'll be fine.

890
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:17,920
Sis,

891
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,480
You're

892
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,239
going too far.

893
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,599
Then tell me,

894
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,599
why did you come to Shanghai?

895
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,480
I've told you 800 times,

896
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm really here to see you.

897
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,079
Yes.

898
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,639
If you hadn't gotten into Xiong Qiming's car,

899
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,760
I would have thought that

900
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,239
my unreasonable brother had grown up.

901
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Sis,

902
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,559
I know I wasn't sensible before.

903
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't blame you even if you blame me.

904
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,159
But mom and dad are really worried about you.

905
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,239
If he finds out,

906
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,280
you have a boyfriend now?

907
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,599
He's not my boyfriend.

908
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay. He's not your boyfriend, is he?

909
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,639
But the way he looks at you,

910
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,519
he likes you.

911
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,880
Gu Liang,

912
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,800
I can't control you now.

913
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,480
I don't want to care about you either.

914
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,719
Don't show up in front of me again.

915
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,559
Sis,

916
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,239
Sister,

917
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,159
sister, I was wrong.

918
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,199
I was wrong, okay?

919
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:55,840
Sis,

920
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,599
I'll be honest with you,

921
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,440
Sis,

922
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:01,760
Me,

923
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,280
Me,

924
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,360
I run a tea factory

925
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,679
with my friend,

926
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,679
There's a problem with the funding.

927
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,360
Gu Liang,

928
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,679
you can't even recite

929
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,239
the multiplication table.

930
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,719
You're still doing business like him?

931
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,440
I just want to

932
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
pay your debt, don't I?

933
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,760
Sis,

934
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,320
Lend me another 100 thousand,

935
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,920
when I'm done with this,

936
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,039
The business is getting bigger.

937
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,760
You don't have to

938
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,639
work so hard,

939
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:28,840
I don't have money.

940
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,280
Xiong Qiming does.

941
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,159
He has millions in his car, right?

942
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,679
Borrow a 1. 00008billion from him.

943
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,599
I'm sure he can lend it to you.

944
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,159
Gu Liang,

945
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,039
let me tell you,

946
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
If you dare to borrow money from him,

947
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
I won't forgive you.

948
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,079
Sister.

949
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,440
You ate them all.

950
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,719
I'm here to eat dumplings.

951
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,039
How can you be like that?

952
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,039
What should I eat?

953
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,000
It tastes awful.

954
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,320
That's why I finished it.

955
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,880
I'll order takeout for you later.

956
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,800
Mr. Sun.

957
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,559
The dumplings are so delicious,

958
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,760
she didn't even want to eat them.

959
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
You asked me to eat them all.

960
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,519
Don't be reluctant to eat.

961
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,519
If everyone likes it,

962
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,039
I'll ask my mom to wrap it later,

963
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,960
No need.

964
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,559
Auntie is so nice,

965
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,880
I don't have the nerve to trouble her.

966
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,360
By the way,

967
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,079
Mr. Yuan is the vice president after all,

968
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,159
Do you

969
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:57,800
understand?

970
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,400
Everyone is talkative,

971
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,960
and they like to gossip so much,

972
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,320
I don't know what to say tomorrow.

973
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,480
Me

974
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,760
I've caused you

975
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,119
a lot of trouble.

976
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,719
Don't think too much.

977
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,079
If you're Mr. Yuan's friend,

978
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,559
you're my friend.

979
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,840
Don't think too much.

980
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,519
I know what to do.

981
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
You really know?

982
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,960
Let's go.

983
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,800
Mr. Gu,

984
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,119
Mr. Xiong is still in a meeting,

985
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,199
Please wait for him here

986
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,199
for a while,

987
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:42,920
It's okay.

988
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,559
Don't worry about me.

989
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,400
Go back to your work.

990
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,719
This leather chair is so comfortable.

991
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,960
President,

992
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
no wonder you're so rich.

993
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,159
Brother,

994
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,960
Gu Liang,
