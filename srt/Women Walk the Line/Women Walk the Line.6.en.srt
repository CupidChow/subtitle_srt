1
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,239
The world economy is facing adjustment,

2
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,359
and the growth rate of the main economy

3
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,280
is slowing down.

4
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,959
The assets and output of the manufacturing industry

5
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,120
have been depressed continuously.

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,519
Inflation is weak

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,400
and consumer confidence remains low.

8
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
The financial industry seems to be thriving,

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,599
but,

10
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,000
Its actual performance.

11
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,560
It's different from a real business.

12
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,159
Those who don't know will think

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
we're from the Finance and Economics School,

14
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,760
Yuan Ge is here,

15
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,640
Wu Mei Xin Xin,

16
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,599
You're a rare visitor.

17
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,799
When I'm looking for you,

18
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,920
why do you always say you're busy?

19
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,239
I'm really busy.

20
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,520
I've brought you

21
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,719
a classmate you're looking forward to.

22
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,159
Who is it?

23
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:11,919
Who is it?

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,319
Hello, everyone. Long time no see,

25
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,439
Gu Qiao

26
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,680
It's been a long time.

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,199
Not only has his appearance not changed,

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
but his figure and dress,

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
It's exactly the same as when we were in school.

30
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:22,919
That's right.

31
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,199
I really haven't seen you for a long time.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
I didn't expect to see you here.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm so happy.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,159
You're still so pretty.

35
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:27,919
That's right.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,919
Come on.

37
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,400
Please have a seat.

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Come on.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,000
President, you're making fun of me again.

40
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,719
Come on, have a seat.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,439
Be careful,

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,039
Ge Ge. I didn't say anything just now.

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,759
You were

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
the campus beauty

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
in the hearts of all the boys in our dorm.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
If I

47
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,439
had been braver,

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Maybe,

49
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,639
the man you call husband now,

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,719
It's me,

51
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,280
Gu Qiao,

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I heard that you will go back to your hometown

53
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,199
to be a young lady after graduation.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,000
Now you

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,319
come to Shanghai for development.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
I know that.

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,759
They have a lot of families

58
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,759
in the county.

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
He must have developed his family business

60
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,280
to Shanghai.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,800
Or

62
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,479
Gu Qiao is smart,

63
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,960
He first developed in his hometown,

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,479
and then slowly

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
infiltrated into Shanghai,

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,439
Not like us.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
After graduation,

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
I worked hard to make money,

69
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,360
I didn't make much money in the end.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,199
Gu Qiao,

71
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,039
what kind of business

72
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,199
does your family do in Shanghai?

73
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,120
Spa,

74
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,439
Sea Club Spa,

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,639
If you need it,

76
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,520
you can come and apply for a card,

77
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,759
I can give you the lowest discount.

78
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,599
Okay.

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,759
The spa I used to go to recently

80
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,360
is being renovated,

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
I'll get one in your shop some other day.

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
Sure. Sure. No problem.

83
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,919
I'm sorry. I'm not late, am I?

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Kexin,

85
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,879
Kexin is here.

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Gu Qiao, you're here?

87
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,759
A busy man is here.

88
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,800
What did I call you before?

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,439
You won't even come out.

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm really busy.

91
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,360
Kexin, you know what?

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
Now Gu Qiao has opened a spa

93
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,879
in Shanghai.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
If you want to go,

95
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
she can give you a discount.

96
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,759
Really?

97
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,919
Kexin, don't stand there.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,479
Have a seat.

99
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,639
Right, right, right. Sit down.

100
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,840
Sit down, sit down. Don't mention it.

101
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,319
Then I suggest that

102
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,399
our classmates,

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,759
We haven't seen each other for so long.

104
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,959
How about we raise our glasses

105
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,560
and have a drink?

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
Cheers!

107
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,360
Cheers!

108
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
-Cheers! -You did the right thing, Gu

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,519
Qiao.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,439
Last time I saw you on the street,

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,839
handing out leaflets by yourself,

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
You haven't found any employees yet, have you?

113
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,399
Distribute leaflets,

114
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,839
I like to

115
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,279
do everything myself.

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
You see,

117
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
as a good manager,

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,759
That's how it should be.

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
You did everything yourself.

120
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,399
What do you want to say?

121
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Gu Qiao was lucky enough

122
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
to go home

123
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,720
as soon as she graduated.

124
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,240
I heard that

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,639
your wedding with Luan Yu,

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,240
It's so exciting.

127
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Why didn't you call him?

128
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,439
Let's take a look

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,480
together.

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Yu Kexin, what do you mean?

131
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,600
What's the point of me?

132
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,279
Just care about it.

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,319
I heard about it.

134
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm sorry,

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,560
What I said just now,

136
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,759
you misunderstood me.

137
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,519
I didn't run that spa.

138
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,680
I just work there.

139
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,160
It's just sales.

140
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,639
You guys eat first.

141
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm going to the bathroom.

142
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,639
Gu Qiao.

143
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,240
Why are they all gone?

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,720
President, what's going on? President.

145
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,199
I heard that

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,560
your wedding with Luan Yu,

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,079
It's so exciting.

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,439
Why didn't you call him?

149
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,240
Let's take a look

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
together.

151
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,439
Gu Qiao

152
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,839
What Yu Kexin said just now,

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,000
don't take it to heart.

154
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,399
That's who she is.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,959
I'm fine.

156
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,360
Besides,

157
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I'm a salesman,

158
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
It's easier to say it out loud.

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,759
I need to answer a phone call.

160
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,480
Hello,

161
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,600
is this the Sea Club Spa?

162
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,519
Yes,

163
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,480
I saw on the leaflet

164
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,480
that your store is having an event,

165
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
-I want to get a

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
card. -Okay.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,759
Our store has

168
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,600
an anniversary celebration now,

169
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
It's very cost-effective to apply for a card now.

170
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,319
Okay,

171
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:05,959
I'll go to your store

172
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,879
and check it out.

173
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, I'll wait for you.

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
What's wrong?

175
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,120
Ge Ge,

176
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,519
I'm going to the store now.

177
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,439
I've figured it out.

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
Instead of pulling these people to apply for cards,

179
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,399
it's better to rely on

180
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,199
my own achievements to be more practical.

181
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll get going.

182
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,959
Let me see you off.

183
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,040
No need.

184
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,720
I can take a taxi myself.

185
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,959
Besides,

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,480
if we

187
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,120
leave together,

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,879
Doesn't that mean

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,160
you're running away?

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,079
I'll get going then.

191
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,959
Goodbye.

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,040
Be careful.

193
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,639
Okay.

194
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Mr. Du,

195
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,399
the person you asked me to inquire about last time,

196
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
I've found out about it.

197
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,920
Tell me,

198
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,279
I asked a lot of my friends,

199
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,519
and they all know that

200
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,399
he's a kid,

201
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,879
Your personal life is messy.

202
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,480
You've made a lot of

203
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,800
friends. Got it.

204
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,680
When she was in the store,

205
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,839
she was just doing sales,

206
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
If she said that in the beginning,

207
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,920
it's not necessary for us.

208
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,240
President,

209
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,079
we are classmates,

210
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,639
Gu Qiao just made a phone call

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,800
at the health clinic,

212
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,319
She said she had an emergency in the company,

213
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,519
so she left first.

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Yuan Ge, look at this.

215
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,759
Have a seat.

216
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
Yuan Ge,

217
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,759
you've already become the president,

218
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,519
He didn't help Gu Qiao

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,960
and asked her to hand out leaflets on the street.

220
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
What a shame.

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,480
Gu Qiao makes money with his own labor,

222
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,279
and he doesn't do anything wrong,

223
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
What's there to be ashamed of?

224
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,200
It's not embarrassing. Why is she

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
pretending here?

226
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,840
Yu Kexin,

227
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,360
if it's because

228
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Luan Yu refused you

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
to propose to Gu Qiao.

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,759
If you're jealous,

231
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,279
congratulations,

232
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,039
You have a chance now.

233
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,759
Come on, Yu Kexin,

234
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,639
you liked Luan Yu before,

235
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:04,840
I remember,

236
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,399
when we were in college,

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,879
You've always told me,

238
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,080
I hate people like Luan Yu

239
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,519
who don't want to make progress the most.

240
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,360
Stop it.

241
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,799
Enjoy your meal.

242
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,240
I have something else to do. I'm leaving.

243
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,039
Kexin,

244
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,919
Kexin Kexin is gone.

245
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,679
What's his name again?

246
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
Bingwen,

247
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,519
Bingwen,

248
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,519
President,

249
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,480
you brat,

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
My boy

251
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,639
I'm late. I'm late.

252
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,120
Come on, get in. You really know

253
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,559
how to pick a place.

254
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,879
When I was in college,

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
Du Bingwen pursued Yuan Ge,

256
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
You're not still

257
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,320
thinking about her, are you?

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,799
I was not sensible at that time,

259
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,720
so I don't want to mention it.

260
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,159
And Mr. Yuan

261
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,559
is now taken.

262
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,440
What?

263
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
Yuan Ge has a boyfriend now.

264
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,600
Tell me about it.

265
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
What exactly is it like?

266
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,879
A man with three heads and six arms,

267
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,559
who can take it down,

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,559
Female schoolmasters like us,

269
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,120
tell me about it.

270
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,519
Where are you from?

271
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,200
Is he handsome?

272
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,639
What kind of job?

273
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,039
Actually, we're still in contact with each other.

274
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,759
Yeah, more contact with each other.

275
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't end up losing money on your own.

276
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Du Bingwen,

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,159
you come to the class reunion,

278
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,919
Just to tell you this,

279
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,120
I just want to tell you briefly,

280
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,320
He's a tough guy.

281
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,440
As long as it's simpler than you.

282
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,480
No matter how simple I am.

283
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,039
I don't cheat feelings either.

284
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,440
Bingwen,

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,279
I advise you,

286
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
Before you know someone well,

287
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,879
don't jump to conclusions.

288
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,879
I also advise you,

289
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,000
before you get to know someone,

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't jump to conclusions.

291
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,240
President,

292
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,519
I have something urgent to do.

293
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll get going.

294
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,960
You can't leave.

295
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,879
Yuan Ge Yuan Ge,

296
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,960
You.

297
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,360
Why is there another one?

298
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,279
Du,

299
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,159
you're Bingwen. You haven't changed at all.

300
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,360
You pissed me

301
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,799
off. Mr. Yuan

302
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,360
is very busy in the company,

303
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,360
I used this method

304
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,000
to motivate her to go back to work.

305
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,840
It's also for the company.

306
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,639
I'm here

307
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,600
for her. Let's have a drink.

308
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,200
Come on.

309
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,080
Whose lipstick is printed?

310
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
Don't care about it.

311
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,039
Cheers. Cheers. I can't stand you.

312
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,879
Come on.

313
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I have a guest.

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Did you see that?

315
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,000
Is that your guest just now?

316
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
I took her to experience the project first.

317
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
Then she said she wanted to apply for a card,

318
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
so I gave her a card.

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,120
You're back.

320
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,879
Why didn't you turn on the light?

321
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
What are you thinking about?

322
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,080
I've been thinking a lot,

323
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,960
thinking about me from marriage to divorce,

324
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,240
And take

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,039
what I don't have left.

326
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,799
You came to Shanghai in disgrace,

327
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,440
and then you worked in a spa

328
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,559
for no reason.

329
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,120
In the past few days,

330
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I've never dreamed about it.

331
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,200
If it were me before,

332
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,919
I wouldn't have thought of it at all,

333
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll be so sad

334
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
because I lost a client.

335
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,279
Don't worry,

336
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,639
you have to take your time at work,

337
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,000
I know.

338
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm just sighing about

339
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
the impermanence of fate.

340
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,200
Don't worry,

341
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,120
I will continue to work hard.

342
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,519
If I give up now,

343
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,919
won't I be doomed

344
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,000
for the rest of my life?

345
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,399
You must be hungry.

346
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,840
I'll cook some noodles for you.

347
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,720
How do you know I'm not full?

348
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,879
I'm sure you won't have enough

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
to eat at a liquor store like this.

350
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,519
I'm telling you,

351
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,159
let me give you a taste.

352
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,519
It's my exclusive soft-boiled egg.

353
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,120
Wait for it.

354
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,000
Master, do you want to see me?

355
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,399
Yeon-hee,

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,039
look at the lunch break,

357
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,840
Who's free?

358
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,919
Help me run there.

359
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,759
Personal matter?

360
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,399
Personal matter?

361
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll go then.

362
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,399
You can't.

363
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,679
You have to

364
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
have a face.

365
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,679
Beauty care.

366
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
Hello. Miss Shan Shan's

367
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,799
takeout. Just leave it here.

368
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,360
Thank you.

369
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,279
There's a clay pot rice nearby.

370
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,240
It's very delicious.

371
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,200
You must try it.

372
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,200
All right, I can do it.

373
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,240
30 yuan each.

374
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,720
Let's add each other on WeChat,

375
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,759
Transfer it to me via WeChat,

376
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay.

377
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,519
Hello,

378
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,039
you guys are over 60,

379
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,000
Is there always

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
a 25% reduction activity?

381
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,759
Yes,

382
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,200
this activity has always been available.

383
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Okay. Thank you.

384
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,519
Gu Qiao, I've ordered takeout.

385
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,559
Here we are

386
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,440
You're here so soon.

387
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,200
Let's go then.

388
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,240
Let's go eat.

389
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,120
Okay.

390
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,879
Excuse me,

391
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,799
can I use the membership card in the store

392
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,799
for my friend?

393
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,080
Good for you.

394
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
Who are you?

395
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,559
I called you yesterday.

396
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,080
Or did you get me the card?

397
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,600
I remember now.

398
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,559
I wasn't in the store

399
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,840
yesterday. I didn't get you the card.

400
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Really?

401
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,639
When I came,

402
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,200
I said I called.

403
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,320
A little girl said she picked it up.

404
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,879
Isn't that girl you?

405
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
That's my colleague.

406
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,159
She must be mistaken.

407
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,320
Goodbye.

408
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,079
Let's eat.

409
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm not hungry.

410
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,920
You eat first.

411
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,920
Happy cooperation.

412
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,240
Happy cooperation.

413
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,839
I didn't expect you

414
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,359
to speak Chinese, Mr. Smith,

415
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,279
A little bit.

416
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,039
I spent a year in Shanghai before.

417
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,319
That's not right.

418
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,640
Please forgive me.

419
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,400
I don't speak Mandarin well.

420
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,440
You're so funny.

421
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,279
Please

422
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,200
Watch your step.

423
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,480
Next time you come,

424
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,559
just call me in advance.

425
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,319
Okay,

426
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,559
Take care.

427
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,680
Goodbye.

428
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,240
Hello,

429
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,400
Hello,

430
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,079
I'll apply for

431
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,400
a card.

432
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,640
Let me introduce to you

433
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,400
some recent promotions

434
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,960
in our store,

435
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,640
No, I want to look for Gu Qiao.

436
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,319
Gu is the same as looking for me.

437
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
We are colleagues.

438
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,839
I'm sorry. I was looking for her.

439
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,400
Gu Qiao isn't here,

440
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,839
Who said I'm not here?

441
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:51,799
Hello. Hello.

442
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,119
I'll apply for a card.

443
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
Okay, let me introduce it to you.

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,559
Okay,

445
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,359
This way, please.

446
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,920
Are we going to apply for a card now?

447
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,200
There's a special offer.

448
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,240
What about the first charge of 10thousand?

449
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,160
You can return 2, 000 yuan.

450
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,119
Actually, for now,

451
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,119
it's still a good deal.

452
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,440
Are you sure

453
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,599
you don't want to do any projects today?

454
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,599
Yes, I really have something to do today.

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,480
I'll come back next time.

456
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,119
Okay,

457
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,240
Call me anytime.

458
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,880
Okay.

459
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,759
Goodbye. Goodbye.

460
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,839
Gu Qiao, congratulations. We finally opened

461
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,079
the first order.

462
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,559
Gu Qiao, what's wrong with you?

463
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,160
I was thinking

464
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
if I hadn't come out just now,

465
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,759
Is this order also gone?

466
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,880
Gu Qiao, what are you talking about?

467
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,359
I don't understand.

468
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
I don't understand.

469
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,240
I said you're not an actor,

470
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,119
What a pity.

471
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,839
Gu Qiao, you misunderstood me.

472
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,400
What did I misunderstand you?

473
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,440
It's a misunderstanding that your takeout has been greatly reduced,

474
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,759
but you asked me to pay the original price.

475
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,440
Or I misunderstood you

476
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,240
for stealing my customers

477
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
over and over again.

478
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:26,960
Okay

479
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,839
Now that

480
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,079
you've come to this point.

481
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,759
Then I want to ask you,

482
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,680
you are a college student,

483
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,359
Why do you want to

484
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,519
compete with us for jobs.

485
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,319
You're carrying a bag of 80thousand,

486
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,319
so you're here to spend money.

487
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,759
Why are you still working here?

488
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,319
To experience life?

489
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,279
You pretend to be like us,

490
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,279
but I'm different from you.

491
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,839
I'm waiting for this month's salary

492
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,359
to pay next month's rent.

493
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,279
You can think of this place

494
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,119
as a game.

495
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,720
But why did you cut me off

496
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,960
by playing games?

497
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,240
If you're not convinced,

498
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,200
then I'll be convinced of the defeat.

499
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,559
Like you said,

500
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,559
I'm here to experience life,

501
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,519
You're a professional,

502
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,799
not even as good as me as an amateur.

503
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,680
How can you be so confident?

504
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,079
You still

505
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
can't go to college,

506
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,799
You didn't work hard enough.

507
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
If you accuse me of this,

508
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,839
say it out loud,

509
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
Don't you think you're funny?

510
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,640
Okay,

511
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,559
See you at Versailles Restaurant

512
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
at 8 o'clock tonight.

513
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,680
Goodbye.

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,759
Goodbye.

515
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,960
Actually, I'm sorry.

516
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,519
Last time, because something happened at work,

517
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,039
I left you hanging there.

518
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,119
I'll treat you to this meal today.

519
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
Are you going to apologize?

520
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,720
Let bygones

521
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
be bygones.

522
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,519
Besides, I noticed that

523
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
you're in a good mood today.

524
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
Really?

525
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,079
That's probably because

526
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,960
I signed a contract

527
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,000
at the company today,

528
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,440
It's worth celebrating.

529
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,079
Thank you.

530
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,160
Actually,

531
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,559
I had a good time today.

532
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,720
Why?

533
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because someone is happy.

534
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,039
Someone very important.

535
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,480
The man before,

536
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,039
has been working hard,

537
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,480
Now I finally have time

538
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,720
to go out on a date.

539
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
And she's in a good mood today.

540
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,880
How can I be unhappy?

541
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,759
Talking about me,

542
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,079
Mr. Yuan,

543
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,519
What a coincidence.

544
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,119
Bring Mr. Smith

545
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,960
over for dinner,

546
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
Mr. Smith, what a coincidence.

547
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
It's nice to see you again.

548
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,599
Nice to meet you.

549
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,880
If you don't mind,

550
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,279
do you mind

551
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,599
if we can have

552
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,559
such a big table together?

553
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,559
I don't mind.

554
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,480
Please have a seat.

555
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,759
I'd like to introduce you.

556
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,839
This is the person in charge of Li Juncheng.

557
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,839
Mr. Smith,

558
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,519
Mr. Smith,

559
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,799
This is Zheng Jinnan.

560
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,319
I've heard a lot about him.

561
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,839
Hello, my name is Du Bingwen

562
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,359
Shumei Hope,

563
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,359
It's just what they said.

564
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,480
Mr. Zheng, a native of Shanxi,

565
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,799
not Shanghai,

566
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,880
There's a Jin in your name,

567
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
so I thought you were from Shanxi,

568
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,119
According to the genealogy,

569
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,160
it should be Jin.

570
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,480
Zheng Jinnan,

571
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,920
a decent man,

572
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
Your name is so interesting.

573
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,359
It's okay.

574
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,599
Mr. Smith,

575
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,160
have a seat,

576
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,359
When will you return home?

577
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,759
I have to wait for two more days.

578
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,000
I have some personal matters

579
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,640
to take care of,

580
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,799
Mr. Smith is looking for

581
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,839
an old friend in Shanghai,

582
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,559
Old friend,

583
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,759
yes,

584
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,720
Her name is Wang Fen.

585
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,720
More than 30 years ago,

586
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,960
I met her in Shanghai,

587
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,680
but then I went back to Switzerland,

588
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,680
He cut off all the clues

589
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
to contact me,

590
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,359
But in this photo,

591
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,000
Mr. Yuan

592
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,839
actually has a lot of contacts in Shanghai,

593
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,640
If she's willing to help,

594
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,359
I'm sure,

595
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,279
I'm sure we can find him.

596
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,799
I'll do my best.

597
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,759
Mr. Yuan can help.

598
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,359
Thank you so much.

599
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,359
You're welcome.

600
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Trust us,

601
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,839
the two of us,

602
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,359
I'll find him for you.

603
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
Mr. Smith,

604
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,000
Yuan Ge's business is my business.

605
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
I will help you, too.

606
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,079
Don't worry.

607
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,759
That would be great.

608
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,839
With the help of the three of you,

609
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I think we can definitely find it.

610
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,359
Thank you so much.

611
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,759
Thank you.

612
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,400
Thank you so much.

613
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,279
Thank you.

614
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,400
You're welcome.

615
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,839
Thank you.

616
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
-You're welcome. -Waiter, serve

617
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,079
the dishes.

618
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,640
Have a seat.

619
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,640
You two eat,

620
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,599
or it'll get cold later.

621
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,000
Ge Ge,

622
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,559
why are you so happy?

623
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,240
Let me tell you,

624
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,039
I opened my first order today,

625
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,839
Congratulations. You

626
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
came back so late,

627
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,480
Where did she go?

628
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,440
I went on a date.

629
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,839
Kind of.

630
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,440
What do you mean by "sort of"?

631
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,839
Is it a date for four people

632
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,759
to eat together?

633
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,559
We're dating together,

634
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,079
and you've already met your parents.

635
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,960
So soon?

636
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,720
Anyway,

637
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,319
it's a long story.

638
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,000
It's not what you think.

639
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,279
Okay,

640
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,480
when will you

641
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,160
bring this boyfriend back? Okay.

642
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,039
Let me see.

643
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:12,880
Let me check

644
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,720
and advise you.

645
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,839
Let's wait for the relationship to stabilize.

646
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,680
I'm going to take a shower.

647
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,720
I was wondering

648
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,559
why he didn't let me see him.

649
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,599
I'd like to see,

650
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
how good is your boyfriend

651
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,519
who spent 50thousand yuan?

652
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,799
Come in

653
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,920
Hello, Miss Chuchu,

654
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,119
this is your green tea,

655
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
I won't drink green tea today.

656
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,519
Okay,

657
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
because you used to drink green tea

658
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,599
every time you came here.

659
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,119
I thought

660
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,400
this is what you like?

661
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,519
Don't you think

662
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,240
I like it,

663
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,160
I don't like to listen to other people's nonsense.

664
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,359
Okay,

665
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,759
I'll change it for you right away.

666
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,559
Miss Chuchu,

667
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,319
what project are you going to do today?

668
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
I won't do the project today.

669
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,839
By the way,

670
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,359
your fruit platter

671
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,400
was good last time,

672
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,200
Give me another one.

673
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,400
Can't you understand me?

674
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Hurry up.

675
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,079
Miss Chuchu,

676
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,799
there's nothing wrong with the fruit platter,

677
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,000
But if you don't

678
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,440
do the project today,

679
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,039
Can you give up your room?

680
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,440
Because there will be

681
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,039
a lot of customers in the shop today.

682
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,519
You can rest in the lobby.

683
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,160
Go to the lobby.

684
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,839
I'm your member.

685
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,640
What is a member?

686
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,559
Members are God. Is this

687
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,400
how you

688
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,319
serve God?

689
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,160
I'm sorry, Miss Chuchu.

690
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,839
I didn't mean anything else.

691
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,240
Since you came to apply for the card,

692
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,400
you've only done one project.

693
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,240
And every time I come here,

694
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,240
I just eat fruit,

695
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,440
Drink some tea

696
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,319
and take photos. Shut up!

697
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,519
Do you want to do a project?

698
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,640
It depends on my mood.

699
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,079
Do you want fruit or tea?

700
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,680
That's the service I deserve.

701
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,799
Your service attitude now,

702
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,920
makes me very unhappy.

703
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,240
Go,

704
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,160
Get your supervisor here

705
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,240
right now.

706
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm sorry,

707
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
our supervisor is not someone

708
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,920
who wants to see him.

709
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,319
What kind of attitude is that?

710
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,079
I'm telling you,

711
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm going to file a complaint today.

712
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,880
What's wrong with you?

713
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,839
Who are you?

714
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm sorry,

715
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,359
I'm the supervisor here.

716
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,599
Supervisor, right?

717
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Good timing.

718
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,160
If I want to return the card,

719
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,960
you can open it.

720
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,799
What are you doing?

721
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,359
What are you doing? What are you doing?

722
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,400
Enough. Shut up.

723
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,599
Excuse me, Miss,

724
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
may I take the liberty of asking you,

725
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,200
Why did you return the card?

726
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,200
Why?

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,200
She

728
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,039
He asked me to sit in the lobby.

729
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,039
You even satirized me

730
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,960
for eating and drinking here.

731
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,359
What does she mean?

732
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm telling you,

733
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,160
I'll cancel this card.

734
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,640
Director, I didn't mean that.

735
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
All right, you may leave.

736
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm sorry, Miss.

737
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,880
She hasn't been here for long,

738
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,599
If you're not sensible,

739
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,680
don't argue

740
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,519
with her.

741
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,279
In addition, you said you wanted to return the card.

742
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,519
Where's this card?

743
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,359
It was held during the event.

744
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,640
If you return it now,

745
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,960
there won't be so much discount.

746
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,039
Please think about it again.

747
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,480
What are you thinking about?

748
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,359
Your service attitude

749
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,039
is like this,

750
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,319
What else do you want me to think about?

751
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,160
Calm down.

752
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,319
How about this?

753
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll find someone else to serve you.

754
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,640
If you're not satisfied,

755
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,880
can you consider returning the card?

756
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,319
I'll ask them

757
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,519
to serve the fruits first,

758
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,720
You can wait while you eat.

759
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,720
Hold on.

760
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,400
What's wrong with you?

761
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,799
Why are you still quarreling with others?

762
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,759
If she gets a card instead of doing a project,

763
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,519
she can come to the private room to take photos every day.

764
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,599
And rub our drinks

765
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,640
and fruit bowls,

766
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,559
Supervisor,

767
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,039
she's so unreasonable.

768
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,839
Customers are God.

769
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
As long as they apply for a card,

770
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,799
we have to provide

771
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,920
the best service.

772
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't you get it?

773
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,440
You too.

774
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,079
Just let her take the photo.

775
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,279
Why are you arguing with her?

776
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,079
She will return the card later.

777
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Then you'll complain to us.

778
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,839
We all have to deduct the bonus.

779
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,480
All right,

780
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,759
go and entertain other guests.

781
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
I'll go there with someone else.

782
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,839
Director,

783
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,680
let Gu Qiao come.

784
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,880
She will do something.

785
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,200
Gu Qiao

786
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,359
Fine.

787
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,119
Go get her.

788
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,519
But you have to remind her

789
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,960
to take good care of her.

790
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,400
Okay.

791
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
Gu Qiao,

792
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,519
Gu Qiao

793
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,640
The supervisor asked you

794
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,759
to entertain a guest,

795
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
It's in Room 203.

796
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,039
Don't look at me like that.

797
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,319
The supervisor asked you to go.

798
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,279
By the way,

799
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,680
the guest in Room 203

800
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:22,799
wants to drink green tea,

801
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,519
When you go,

802
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,200
remember to pour a cup.

803
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,160
Bring it to the guest.

804
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,759
Hello, I've told you

805
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,920
about your green tea,

806
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,279
If I don't drink green tea or green tea,

807
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,319
don't you understand

808
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,920
why it's you?

809
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,240
Chuchu,

810
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,200
I told you not to drink green tea,

811
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,519
And then he poured me green tea,

812
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
and when I got angry,

813
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,400
The guest in Room 203

814
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,240
wants to drink green tea,

815
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,000
When you go,

816
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,720
remember to pour a cup.

817
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,680
Bring it to the guest.

818
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,359
No, no.

819
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,240
You have to deal with it now.

820
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:09,720
You.

821
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,400
It's okay. You didn't mean it.

822
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,880
-Sit down. -Be careful here. I'll

823
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,079
get you another glass of water.

824
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,759
By the way,

825
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,319
aren't you a bag seller?

826
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,559
Why are you here?

827
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,680
I'm a salesman here,

828
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,480
so you said before,

829
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,200
Your bag is real.

830
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,920
How much money do you earn

831
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,279
in a month when you work in sales here?

832
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,240
How can you afford

833
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,400
so many designer bags,

834
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,839
My bag is real.

835
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
I bought them at the counter.

836
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:37,920
If you don't believe me,

837
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,880
you can check it.

838
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,079
Forget it.

839
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,359
Don't worry,

840
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,240
about the fake bag you sold,

841
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll leave it to you.

842
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,640
After all, I accidentally

843
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,799
burned you just now.

844
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,839
But it's different from each other.

845
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,839
You have to return this card.

846
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,640
This bag

847
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,759
Okay, I'll talk to my supervisor.

848
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,079
Excuse me,

849
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,279
hello,

850
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,240
This afternoon, the spa you asked for at 4: 00

851
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,759
p. m.,

852
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,759
Are you still coming?

853
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,200
What are you doing?

854
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,720
Don't you know

855
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,039
why it's spilled?

856
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,319
What's wrong with you?

857
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,079
Shan Shan was so careless

858
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,440
that she spilled water on her own.

859
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,359
You were so careless.

860
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,759
Look, the clothes are all wet.

861
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,880
You can't afford to provoke me.

862
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,039
So don't mess with me.

863
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,839
I'm going to get a bag.

864
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:07,880
Look,

865
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,360
the man beside Mr. Yuan

866
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,199
is so handsome.

867
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,159
Look.

868
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,400
Did you see that?

869
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,480
Yes, I did.

870
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,280
That is to say, the flowers Mr. Yuan received before,

871
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,639
were all from him.

872
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Nice view.

873
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,519
When did you take this picture?

874
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,599
Back in college.

875
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,559
It's cute.

876
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,039
Can I take a picture?

877
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,960
Be my guest.

878
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,280
I really can't tell that

879
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,800
Mr. Yuan is so good.

880
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,400
I also think,

881
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,079
this boyfriend is really good.

882
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,320
He's tall and handsome.

883
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
You're a little shallow-minded.

884
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,679
It depends on the man.

885
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,719
The most important thing is to look at temperament.

886
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,679
What do you think of

887
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,000
his temperament?

888
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,639
If the full score is 100,

889
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,519
I can give him 90 points.

890
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,079
How many points will you give me?

891
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Mr. Du,

892
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,440
I'll give you a score of 999.

893
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,960
I don't want you to be proud.

894
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,880
Get back to work.

895
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:32,559
Okay.

896
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,159
Don't look at me.

897
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,559
Look at what this form is made of?

898
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,599
Do it again.

899
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I'll watch you do it.

900
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:47,840
Do it

901
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,360
What's wrong?

902
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,079
I accidentally burned myself.

903
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,280
You didn't burn the customer, did you?

904
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,639
No.

905
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,280
By the way, the guest said she wanted to return

906
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,679
the card.

907
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,679
I've already reported the results.

908
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,960
I can't return it.

909
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,000
How about this.

910
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,480
You're a good talker.

911
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,559
Talk it over with her,

912
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,599
Tell her not to return it.

913
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,800
Me,

914
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,199
I don't know what to say.

915
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:42,840
I can't.

916
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,719
Well,

917
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,360
if you can convince her,

918
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,920
This is your performance.

919
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,920
How much does she pay for the card?

920
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:54,880
50 thousand,

921
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,920
it's all yours.

922
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,639
Let me take a picture for you.

923
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,760
Let me take a panoramic picture of you.

924
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,599
Come on,

925
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,199
Is your hand okay?

926
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm fine.

927
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,880
It's so pretty.

928
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,320
Why don't you sit down?

929
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,119
I'll take some more photos for you.

930
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,000
Looks like your legs

931
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:26,840
are growing well.

932
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,039
Okay, okay.

933
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,239
-Yes. -Stretch your legs out a

934
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,079
little more. It's so nice.

935
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,320
Can you take a look?

936
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,800
It's not bad.

937
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,239
By the way, did you tell your supervisor

938
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,639
about returning the card?

939
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,920
I told you,

940
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,239
but why did you return the card?

941
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,840
No reason.

942
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,360
If you want to return it, you can return it.

943
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Here's the thing,

944
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,800
there's a problem with our system today

945
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,559
and it's being overhauled,

946
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,199
So I can't return the card today.

947
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,559
If the system is overhauled,

948
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,639
I'll tell you.

949
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,800
Fine,

950
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,239
I don't care what reason you use

951
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,079
to prevaricate me.

952
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,159
Tell your supervisor,

953
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,159
I have to return this card tomorrow.

954
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,840
Why don't I

955
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
take you to the exhibition later.

956
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,519
My friend did it.

957
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,239
Okay.

958
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:31,960
Yuan Ge,

959
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,440
what's wrong?

960
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,960
Do you remember

961
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,320
what you promised Mr. Smith?

962
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,719
I remember,

963
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,559
I've asked someone

964
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,559
to inquire about Wang Fen.

965
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,840
It's Wang Fen in Shanghai. There are 800 people

966
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,199
without 1000.

967
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,079
It's too inefficient to ask.

968
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,199
What do you want to do?

969
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,719
I got some clues

970
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,320
about the photo studio,

971
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,960
What do you think?

972
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,320
Let's go together now.

973
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,239
Now,

974
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,639
how about another day?

975
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,280
It's not that I can't do it another day.

976
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,239
But,

977
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,920
you've promised

978
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,880
Mr. Smith.

979
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,119
And he's leaving soon.

980
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,239
another day

981
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,960
When is the next day?

982
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,280
Mr. Zheng,

983
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,960
how about

984
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,679
Let's go to the exhibition another day.

985
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,360
Maybe another day.

986
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,920
Let me

987
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,440
drive you there.

988
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,199
After all, I promised

989
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,960
to help you last time.

990
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,199
Okay.

991
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
Thank you.

992
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,000
Du Bingwen,

993
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,719
are you sure that photo studio

994
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,320
is there?

995
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,039
I think so.

996
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,639
I checked the old Shanghai map

997
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,000
thirty years ago,

998
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,960
There's a alley there,

999
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
30 years ago until now,

1000
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,960
It hasn't changed.

1001
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,039
And in that alley,

1002
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,679
back then,

1003
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,719
There's a Chengwen photo studio

1004
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,519
that's been around for 30 years.

1005
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,599
There must be a studio that has closed down.

1006
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,639
This is Shanghai.

1007
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,559
Anything can happen.

1008
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,719
So I'm not sure.

1009
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,280
Let's go and have a look.

1010
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,559
We're almost there.

1011
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Sorry

1012
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,960
to have delayed your date.

1013
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,920
It's okay. It's a pleasure

1014
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,320
to help others,

1015
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,039
Besides, I,

1016
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:55,559
Mr. Yuan,

1017
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,199
When we were in the meeting,

1018
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,960
that proposal,

1019
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,000
What do you think?

1020
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,679
In my opinion,

1021
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,199
we need to refine it.

1022
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,480
You think of the same thing as me.

1023
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,320
I also think

1024
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,159
we need to improve it.

1025
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,599
Although the studio has closed down,

1026
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,239
as long as we can find

1027
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,719
the person who opened the studio back then,

1028
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,199
There should be some clues.

1029

I don't know. I don't know him. I haven't seen him.

1060
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,239
I don't know.

1061
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:36,960
-Okay. -Thank you,

1062

Let me tell you something.

I may not be able to

1075
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:17,840
go to your exhibition.

1076
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,360
Don't mention it.

1077
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,440
I killed Cheng Yaojin halfway.

1078
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,679
The celery you bought today

1079
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,800
is too tender.

1080

It's been locked up for more than ten years.

1090
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,079
But now his son

1092
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,239
Where is it?

1093
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,119
It's just over the road ahead.

1094
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,199
Thank you, Auntie.

1095
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,199

00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,599
Think about it. Let's go this way.

1097
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,519
Now the little girl is so pretty,
