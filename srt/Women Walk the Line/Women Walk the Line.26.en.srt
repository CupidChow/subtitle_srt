1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,599
This is your diet food.

2
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,640
Uncle Broccoli,

3
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,280
you should eat more too.

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,719
Come on,

5
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Have some meat,

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,519
Okay,

7
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,239
Here you are

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,079
Yuan Ge

9
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,680
has the same temper as me,

10
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,400
So strong.

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,159
There are some things,

12
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,400
you can't argue with her.

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
You two,

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,480
I grew up together

15
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,920
in primary school and school,

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
High school is the same school,

17
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,840
and high school and university are still the same school.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,319
Since you were a child,

19
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,719
I've treated you

20
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,120
as my own daughter.

21
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,280
Yuan Ge also treats you as her own sister,

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,479
and in a flash,

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,520
You are so old now.

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,719
You came to Shanghai to make a living.

25
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,680
Normally,

26
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,840
you should

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
support each other,

28
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,039
Mutual understanding.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,879
Just because of

30
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,680
something that's not worth it,

31
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,479
You hurt each other's feelings.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
Am I right?

33
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,599
Yes.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,759
I know, uncle.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,479
When I talk

36
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,680
a lot now,

37
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,680
You're getting old

38
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,680
and talking nonsense,

39
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't dislike me.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't bother.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
I like listening to you.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,879
The sweet and sour pork ribs are for you.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,599
Have one,

44
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,879
Okay,

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,039
To lose weight.

46
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,159
I also need some animal fat.

47
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,360
Qiao Qiao,

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,759
I want to go back tomorrow.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Why are you leaving so soon?

50
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,639
Let's go back.

51
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,520
In Shanghai,

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,680
I can't help you.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Back to my hometown,

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,919
some of my old colleagues,

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,159
Old friends,

56
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,039
we can go fishing together,

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,719
Let's play cards and chat.

58
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,879
Here,

59
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,599
I can only stay at home all day,

60
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,680
Yuan Ge and I

61
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,759
have nothing in common.

62
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
When I go back to my hometown,

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,599
I'll make room

64
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,800
for you,

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
You can move back in.

66
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,199
You have a common language,

67
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,680
and you can take care of each other

68
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,319
both at work and in life.

69
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,199
Uncle, you're right.

70
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,279
But tell me,

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
I can't always

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
rely on Yuan Ge.

73
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,439
How can this be called dependence?

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,560
Yuan Ge's house is so big,

75
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,920
you don't need to

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,319
rent another house to waste money.

77
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,040
Didn't I tell you just now?

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
You can move back in.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,399
When you two are together,

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,639
whether it's work or not,

81
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,720
In life,

82
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,399
we can take care of each other.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,439
Your parents and I,

84
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,519
as old people,

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,439
We can rest assured.

86
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:51,920
Got it.

87
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,439
Uncle,

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,560
If you leave tomorrow,

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,199
I'll see you off.

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,279
Eat it.

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,759
Dad,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
Have you brought

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,639
your phone, home key

94
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,120
and ID card?

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
Didn't you help me clean it up?

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Take it. Don't worry.

97
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,600
Take care of yourself when you go home.

98
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,079
Remember to take your medicine

99
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,839
on time. What's wrong with you?

100
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,720
Go to the hospital now.

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,639
Got it.

102
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,519
I'm not a kid.

103
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm afraid of you,

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,680
and I don't take what I said

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,639
seriously, right?

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,120
I … You don't have to worry.

107
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,160
It's you.

108
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,319
You can't work overtime all the time,

109
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,560
you hear me?

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
And three meals a day. Be sure

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,439
to eat them on time.

112
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,279
Du,

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
Please

114
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,319
You take good care of Yuan Ge,

115
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,319
and you'll be fine in Shanghai,

116
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,040
I have nothing to worry about.

117
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,879
Don't worry, uncle.

118
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,480
This is what I should do.

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
Uncle,

120
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,720
be careful.

121
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,399
Gu Qiao, you're here?

122
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,040
That's right.

123
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,160
Uncle,

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,759
this is the tonic I bought for you.

125
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,079
Take it home.

126
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,360
What are you doing?

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,959
Gu Qiao,

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,639
You,

129
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,399
It's not easy for you to stay in Shanghai.

130
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,759
You're spending money on these things.

131
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,600
This is a small gift from me.

132
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,199
You have to go back

133
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,399
and take good care of yourself.

134
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,600
Hey, Du,

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,879
hold it for me.

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,839
Gu Qiao,

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,759
Yuan Ge,

138
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,160
When I go back to my hometown,

139
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,519
I hope you two,

140
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,079
It'll be fine,

141
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
you know?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
What about you?

143
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay,

144
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,720
That way, I can rest assured.

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
Du,

146
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,199
please check

147
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,759
my luggage for me.

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,199
Don't go in there.

149
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,160
As it happens,

150
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I have something

151
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,120
to talk to Du alone.

152
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,639
Okay,

153
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,319
Don't worry.

154
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,360
I'll call you

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,519
as soon as I get off the plane.

156
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,279
Okay.

157
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,639
Uncle,

158
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,680
take good care of yourself.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,199
Okay.

160
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,360
Dad, be careful.

161
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,519
Remember what I told you.

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,839
Come back and stay.

163
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,759
No, thanks.

164
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,800
You're still mad at me.

165
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,439
No. It's over.

166
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,079
I found a new place to live.

167
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,160
With Wang Mei,

168
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,439
though not that big,

169
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,600
But it's comfortable for me to live here.

170
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,319
In that case,

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,480
aren't you going to invite me to be your guest?

172
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,759
Come if you want.

173
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Come on in!

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a little hot here.

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,279
I'll turn on the air conditioner

176
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,480
for you. A friend is here.

177
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,039
By the way,

178
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,200
this is my roommate,

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,519
Hello.

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,519
No batteries,

181
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,159
living room is a public area,

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,279
Don't turn on the air conditioner.

183
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,480
Well,

184
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,679
Then open a window.

185
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,679
Open a window.

186
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,600
There's a draught.

187
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,799
I'm sorry,

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
please keep your voice down,

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,559
Is that okay?

190
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,799
My wife is not feeling well today.

191
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm resting.

192
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
It's okay.

194
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,399
Let's talk inside.

195
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,240
I.

196
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,279
I left in such a hurry this morning

197
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,240
that I forgot to fold it.

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Have a seat.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,559
You must be thirsty.

200
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,879
I'll get you some water later.

201
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,679
No, I'm not thirsty.

202
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,279
It's too messy.

203
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,279
How many people

204
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,519
do you rent here?

205
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,360
Three households,

206
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,480
actually, we are usually very lively,

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,759
Well.

208
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,360
Are you used to

209
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,960
living here?

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm used to it.

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
Of course I'm used to it.

212
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,799
It's just that it's a little small,

213
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,039
but it's quite warm.

214
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,919
Why don't you

215
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,679
come home with me.

216
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Actually, I'm really

217
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,360
good here.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,960
Besides,

219
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,120
I've been thinking a lot these days.

220
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,360
Since I came to Shanghai,

221
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,480
I've been relying on you.

222
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,960
You're helping me.

223
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,159
We grew up together,

224
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,919
I should help you.

225
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,480
Gu Qiao,

226
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,519
I don't want to see you

227
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,320
suffer like this,

228
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,759
I also hope you can understand that

229
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,120
no matter what happens to you,

230
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,720
You have me.

231
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,919
Yes

232
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,720
When I was at a low point in my life,

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you took care of

234
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,759
everything for me.

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
But there are some things,

236
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,759
some obstacles,

237
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,879
I have to go through it myself.

238
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,279
Just like

239
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
If I don't move out,

240
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
I don't know at all.

241
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,639
It's not easy to work hard

242
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,639
in a big city.

243
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,679
You know what?

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Every day,

245
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,919
you have to go out two hours early.

246
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,039
If I lived in your house,

247
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,360
I wouldn't know that at all.

248
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,759
So I thought,

249
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,120
on my own,

250
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,279
In Shanghai, a big city,

251
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,879
you have to strive for your own world.

252
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,919
Although this place

253
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,679
isn't as nice as yours,

254
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
However,

255
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
I live in a very comfortable place.

256
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,679
What happened to Bai Xue

257
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,480
is the best hint.

258
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,879
It's time for me

259
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,240
to learn to be truly independent.

260
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,759
Master,

261
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,720
has everything been handed over?

262
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,679
Master,

263
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,559
the plagiarism

264
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,320
has been solved.

265
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,240
Gu Qiao is back, too.

266
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,399
Then I.

267
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,519
Can you stay?

268
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
It seems that you still don't understand

269
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,039
your mistake,

270
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,159
And has this matter been resolved?

271
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,360
It doesn't matter at all.

272
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,080
But,

273
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,399
but Master,

274
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,200
Everyone makes mistakes.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,919
Master,

276
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,279
please look at me all these years,

277
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,279
I've been working hard under you,

278
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,240
but I've never done anything.

279
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,120
I can leave the others alone.

280
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,799
But if you really

281
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
take me as your master,

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,320
You should understand,

283
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,799
what you've done

284
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,480
has touched my bottom line.

285
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
I know.

286
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Master,

287
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
all this time,

288
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,399
I really take you as my master.

289
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,799
I see you

290
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,600
as my idol,

291
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,320
I see you

292
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
as my goal,

293
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
I think of you as my sister.

294
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,759
At work,

295
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,320
As long as you make the decision,

296
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,000
I will always stand by your side

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
unconditionally.

298
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,240
If you pay it back,

299
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,679
you pay it back.

300
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,919
If you really

301
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,399
take me as your disciple.

302
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,879
Is there really no love

303
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,080
between us at all?

304
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,320
Say goodbye to everyone.

305
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,960
It was indeed my fault.

306
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,320
But Master,

307
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,679
don't you ever

308
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,120
do anything wrong?

309
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,880
You don't

310
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,440
work hard,

311
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
You asked me to accompany you.

312
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,920
Look at this duck egg yolk.

313
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,559
Do they want to see it?

314
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,799
What do you mean?

315
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,640
Mr. Fu hates the fact that

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,119
employees don't distinguish between public and private affairs,

317
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,079
Mr. Du and Mr. Yuan

318
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,279
knowingly committed the crime.

319
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,519
What do you want to do with the photos?

320
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,480
It's up to you.

321
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,519
As for this matter,

322
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,799
I will explain it to Mr. Fu myself.

323
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,519
If there's nothing else,

324
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,279
Get out

325
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,480
Yanxi,

326
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,839
what are you doing?

327
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,680
Yanxi,

328
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
are you getting a promotion?

329
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
You've changed to a separate office.

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,799
I quit.

331
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,079
You

332
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,480
… You changed jobs?

333
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,759
Is the salary high?

334
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,160
If you didn't change jobs,

335
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,920
did you resign naked?

336
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,640
Why is it so sudden?

337
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,599
Did something

338
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,640
happen to you?

339
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,079
Not really.

340
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,079
I'm just tired.

341
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,119
I want to have a rest.

342
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,839
Yanxi,

343
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,119
I'm impressed with you.

344
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,039
You're the only out-of-town girl I've ever seen

345
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,039
who dares to resign naked,

346
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,680
Are you really leaving?

347
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,319
We will miss you.

348
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,440
Do you have any plans next?

349
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,519
Yanxi,

350
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,799
after you left,

351
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,799
Don't forget us.

352
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,279
We can get together and keep in touch when we're free.

353
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,119
Get back to work.

354
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,920
Wang Mei,

355
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,920
if you want a promotion and a raise in the future,

356
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,279
Don't slack off.

357
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,000
Xia Meng, don't laugh.

358
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,920
Do you still want a boyfriend?

359
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,720
Don't be so picky.

360
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,920
All right, guys,

361
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,720
I'm leaving.

362
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,880
Come on, guys!

363
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,079
-Manager Zheng. -Goodbye, Manager Zheng.

364
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,359
Is what she said true?

365
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,920
I feel weird.

366
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,680
If you pass the interview,

367
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,759
when can you come to work

368
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,519
as soon as possible,

369
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,079
Tomorrow? No,

370
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,599
I can go to work now.

371
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
There's no need to be in such a hurry.

372
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,079
Come and report for duty next week.

373
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,920
Okay,

374
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,519
Thank you.

375
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,319
Sir,

376
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,440
Well,

377
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,599
Then I'll go

378
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,839
prepare the entry materials.

379
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,359
Mr. Yuan,

380
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,279
this kid is just like you,

381
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,240
Mr. Yuan,

382
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,319
I have a problem,

383
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,079
Can I ask you

384
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,160
if it's convenient?

385
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,160
What problem?

386
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,720
Go ahead,

387
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,240
this is it,

388
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,759
In South China,

389
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,960
profits fell sharply

390
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,920
in the first half of the year.

391
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,480
I didn't get it after looking at it for a long time.

392
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,839
Where is the root of the problem?

393
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,359
As I recall,

394
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,279
this is not your job.

395
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,839
I just want to learn more.

396
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,759
It'll be helpful for your future work.

397
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:54,880
Well,

398
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,279
you can try to

399
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,119
combine the profit with the sales,

400
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,559
Then you'll understand.

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,119
I see.

402
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,759
Thank you, Master.

403
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Master,

404
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,279
you've taught me so much,

405
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,640
I'll call you Master from now on.

406
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
Master,

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,720
why aren't you off work yet?

408
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,960
Me,

409
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,880
I want to finish the plan before I leave.

410
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,319
I was a little sleepy just now,

411
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
so I fell asleep.

412
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,279
Isn't this plan

413
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,480
due next week?

414
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,039
But I want to show it to you

415
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,200
after this week.

416
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,119
Can you give me some guidance?

417
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,559
I have time to change it.

418
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,079
Okay,

419
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,160
I'll get going then.

420
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,559
Don't be too late.

421
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,119
Master, take care.

422
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,839
Master, you have something else to do?

423
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,160
No.

424
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,799
I was just thinking,

425
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,160
I have nothing to do when I go home,

426
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,440
Let me take a look at it for you.

427
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,440
Really?

428
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,039
That's great.

429
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,640
Master, have a seat.

430
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,559
Thank you.

431
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,759
Here.

432
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm sorry.

433
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,839
Why did you say sorry?

434
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,079
Yeon-hee is gone.

435
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,640
She's pretending to be you?

436
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,599
About getting rid of the old painter.

437
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,039
I didn't tell Mr. Fu the truth,

438
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,440
I was going to,

439
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,759
Give her another chance.

440
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,400
It's okay,

441
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,279
anyway

442
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,599
I'm back to work.

443
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,119
She hurt you so much,

444
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,599
don't you blame her?

445
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,039
Everyone is standing at a different angle,

446
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
standing at her point of view,

447
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,680
I can understand that.

448
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I hope

449
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,920
she can find a job soon.

450
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,200
Gu Qiao,

451
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,400
I think

452
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,480
you've changed a lot

453
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,279
since you moved out.

454
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
There's a price

455
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,920
to pay for growing up.

456
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,000
What's wrong?

457
00:27:59,119 --> 00:27:59,880
What are you thinking?

458
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,960
Thinking about Du Bingwen and me,

459
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,079
I thought,

460
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
Just confess to Mr. Fu.

461
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,079
What do you mean?

462
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,319
There is no impenetrable wall in this world.

463
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,160
It's not a good idea

464
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
to keep hiding things like this.

465
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,160
Besides,

466
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,599
the company also has a clear regulation,

467
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
This rule

468
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,839
is made by people,

469
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,119
When President Fu

470
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,240
made this rule,

471
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,440
She must be scared too.

472
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,720
Everyone is dating in the office,

473
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
which will affect their work.

474
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,519
But unlike Du Bingwen,

475
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,240
you're both workaholics.

476
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,720
I can't wait to see you in private,

477
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
and we're all talking about work,

478
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,240
But if I

479
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,279
don't want buts.

480
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,839
If you tell Mr. Fu about this,

481
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
how do you want Mr. Fu to choose?

482
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,599
Are you leaving

483
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,079
or Du Bingwen?

484
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,079
Besides,

485
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,359
does Du Bingwen know about this?

486
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,839
I haven't told him yet.

487
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Look,

488
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,559
You didn't even tell him,

489
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,799
so you made your own decision.

490
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,279
In fact, Jeong Yeon Hee already knows

491
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,799
about Du Bingwen and me.

492
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,279
Think about it,

493
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,519
so many people in the company are staring at it.

494
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,359
Even if we keep it a secret,

495
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,559
someone will find out sooner or later.

496
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,279
What if you say it out loud?

497
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,440
I'll feel more at ease.

498
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,759
Have you made up your mind?

499
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,000
It was you who left,

500
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,519
or Du Bingwen.

501
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,240
Ge Ge,

502
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
you graduated from college,

503
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,960
Then I came to Shumei.

504
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,319
As a woman,

505
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,319
you gave Shumei

506
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,119
your best youth.

507
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,920
You left Shu Mei

508
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,440
because of this,

509
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,839
And didn't you tell me before?

510
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,400
In your life,

511
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,119
love and marriage,

512
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,519
It's just a small part

513
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,359
of your life,

514
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,000
The most important thing for you,

515
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,400
is your career.

516
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,559
Indeed,

517
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,160
after everything that has happened,

518
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,720
I gradually feel that

519
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,319
you're right.

520
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,200
Men will abandon us.

521
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,519
But I can't do it in my career.

522
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,359
So no matter how good Du Bingwen is,

523
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,720
I don't want you,

524
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,440
Because he left Shumei.

525
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,960
So what you mean is,

526
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,680
let Du Bingwen leave for me.

527
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,799
Of course not.

528
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,200
This is an important moment

529
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,240
for Li Juncheng's development.

530
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,359
He can't leave either.

531
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,039
So,

532
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,480
this is simply

533
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,359
an unsolved problem,

534
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,079
If you ask me,

535
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,160
you're just like now,

536
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,839
Besides, outside people are popular

537
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,119
among many people in the workplace, aren't they?

538
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,759
Actually, my dad

539
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,279
wants me to start a family as soon as possible.

540
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,200
That's good.

541
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,839
If I quit my job,

542
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:10,920
it will make my relationship

543
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
with Du Bingwen,

544
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,160
If it goes better,

545
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,680
it's not that I can't think so.

546
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,000
Besides,

547
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,799
with him in the company,

548
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,079
I can rest assured.

549
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,119
Ge Ge,

550
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,400
you really can't think like that.

551
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,279
In a relationship,

552
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,359
one of them gives unilaterally,

553
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Then the other party

554
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,160
will think it's a constraint.

555
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,680
If you really want to confess,

556
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,960
I advise you

557
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,279
to have a good talk with Du Bingwen,

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
Let's see what he has to say.

559
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,519
What a surprise!

560
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,519
I told you,

561
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,240
I told you,

562
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,880
there must be something wrong with them.

563
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:01,920
You see,

564
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,839
this is absolutely a world-opening event,

565
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,200
The most shocking melon.

566
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
That's what happened.

567
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,799
Don't be a hindsight, okay?

568
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,519
I've already told you.

569
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,519
Just do what you want.

570
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,200
Am I right?

571
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,000
Why am I belittling you?

572
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,240
Isn't it

573
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,680
a done deal now?

574
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,200
Can anyone

575
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,160
bring Mr. Fu here?

576
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,000
Mr. Fu is not here,

577
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,079
you can go back to work.

578
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:41,519
Okay.

579
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,119
Mr. Fu,

580
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,920
where are you?

581
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,160
Okay,

582
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,039
I'm here to see you.

583
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,480
Hurry up.

584
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,519
What's the matter? Fan Fan,

585
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,119
what do you want from me?

586
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,559
I miss you.

587
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,599
Are you worried that

588
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,519
after leaving the company,

589
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,799
You won't have a chance to see me.

590
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,559
That's right.

591
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:23,880
The two of us

592
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,279
were caught red-handed by Sister Wang.

593
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,599
That's all I can do.

594
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,920
But,

595
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't have to go.

596
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,440
Why?

597
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Didn't Mr. Yuan and Mr. Du

598
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
also get exposed?

599
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,799
Mr. Fu, we can't let them

600
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,839
choose one from the other.

601
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,400
The only way,

602
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
is to abolish this stupid rule.

603
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,000
In that case,

604
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,279
we have to thank him.

605
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,039
This photo.

606
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,160
Fan Fan,

607
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,839
that photo,

608
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,759
You didn't put it up, did you?

609
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,239
Mr. Fu,

610
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,840
Bingwen,

611
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
You're here too.

612
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,639
Sit down,

613
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,480
Have some porridge.

614
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,159
Come on,

615
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
No, no, no.

616
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,320
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

617
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,320
I've eaten.

618
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,239
Mr. Yuan is also here,

619
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,320
so I have something to tell you.

620
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,760
Tell me.

621
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,719
I'm going to quit.

622
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,800
Before you came,

623
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,719
Ge Zi

624
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,000
He said the same thing.

625
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,559
The result of your discussion

626
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,599
is to break up.

627
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,039
Why?

628
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,679
You're right.

629
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,800
A really good love,

630
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,679
should not be overpaid

631
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,639
for either side,

632
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm not asking you two to break up.

633
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,000
The result is already like this,

634
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,639
does it matter how the process goes?

635
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,119
No,

636
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,400
you're still in the mood

637
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,519
to work here,

638
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,880
Lower your voice.

639
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,079
Everyone outside is listening.

640
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:11,599
I don't care.

641
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,400
I just want to know

642
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,320
what's on your mind?

643
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,159
With your personality,

644
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,840
Du Bingwen wants you.

645
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,039
For a job,

646
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:17,920
you lost the man

647
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,599
you love the most.

648
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,239
Are you

649
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,480
out of your mind?

650
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,480
Are you done?

651
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,159
No, I didn't.

652
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,079
Then you can stay at home

653
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,800
tonight. I'll let you scold me at home

654
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,719
You,

655
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
You can't be saved.

656
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,320
It seems that we really broke up.

657
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,760
Do you know what Fan Fan told me

658
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,239
when I went to the reception

659
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,119
to get Dishui Guanyin?

660
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,480
What did he say?

661
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,639
She was dating Zhang Wei,

662
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,960
and Sister found out,

663
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,360
Fan Fan has decided to resign now.

664
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,840
You knew it already.

665
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,440
You're hiding it from me,

666
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,519
you big mouth,

667
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,599
I think Fan Fan

668
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,039
really likes Zhang Wei,

669
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,440
If you tell anyone,

670
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,079
won't you break them up?

671
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,840
Am I that kind of person?

672
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
See you,

673
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,639
Plastic Sister.

674
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,840
This is not the time to talk about it. Anyway,

675
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,039
I think,

676
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,119
Compared to Fan Fan and the others,

677
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Yuan and Du,

678
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,679
It's not true love at all.

679
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,320
It's not a loss for Fan Fan

680
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,599
to resign just as he said it.

681
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,400
But Mr. Yuan is the vice president,

682
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,440
in real life,

683
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
There's no such thing as fairy tale love.

684
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,639
Work hard.

685
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,159
Who is it?

686
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,199
Don't call it robbery.

687
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,000
Do you look so different?

688
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Both of you,

689
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,000
I can't bear to let go of either of you.

690
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,519
Bingwen,

691
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,920
when you first reported to our company,

692
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,480
Actually, I already knew it.

693
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
If Yuan Ge isn't here,

694
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,760
no matter how good the offer is,

695
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,960
You won't even come.

696
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,679
But at that time,

697
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,239
I wasn't sure.

698
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,760
So I didn't take it to heart.

699
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,519
But now I know.

700
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,280
But you two,

701
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,239
which one do you want me to give up?

702
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,719
I can't bear to part with it.

703
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,880
So there's only one way now.

704
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,519
Acting.

705
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,239
I told you I couldn't act.

706
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,039
Who can stand such a performance

707
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,920
in the company every day?

708
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,320
Why do you keep staring at my face?

709
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,719
Is there anything on my face?

710
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,639
Now your face is full of words,

711
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
"I'm in love. ",

712
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,559
I said I couldn't do it

713
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,519
after just one day.

714
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
So obvious?

715
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,000
I told you,

716
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,559
I don't know how to act.

717
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,199
How did you know that?

718
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,559
Can you hide it from me

719
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,519
with your trick?

720
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,400
But you two

721
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,440
are so mean.

722
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,719
You didn't even tell me.

723
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Don't be mad.

724
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,320
Well,

725
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,280
I've discussed it with her,

726
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,800
He didn't tell anyone,

727
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,599
so he didn't even tell you.

728
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,599
All right,

729
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,880
I don't remember the mistakes of others,

730
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:14,760
I should have

731
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,920
paved the way for you.

732
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,639
Everything is ready,

733
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,559
you two don't reveal it.

734
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,159
Thank you.

735
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,119
Thank you.

736
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,360
I'm leaving.

737
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,559
Wang Mei,

738
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,400
give this to Mr. Yuan.

739
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Why me?

740
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,360
You are excellent.

741
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
If Mr. Yuan is unhappy,

742
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,960
what should he do if he takes it out on me?

743
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,760
You can choose not to go.

744
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,159
Do I dare?

745
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Life is not easy.

746
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:22,760
Come in,

747
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,519
Mr. Yuan,

748
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,239
Mr. Du asked me to give this to you.

749
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,079
Come back.

750
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:42,199
This is the monthly summary.

751
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,199
What I want is a quarterly summary.

752
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,719
Mr. Yuan,

753
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,119
I don't know anything.

754
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,880
Maybe you should ask Mr. Du.

755
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,519
Get out.

756
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,559
Are they quarreling?

757
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,239
Look at this posture.

758
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,440
It's hard to say.

759
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,000
So,

760
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Mr. Fu, office romance is strictly forbidden.

761
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,679
It makes sense.

762
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:15,840
You scared the hell out of me.

763
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,800
They broke up.

764
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,639
We have to be together every day

765
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,400
because of work,

766
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,599
How embarrassing.

767
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,960
I don't know if they're embarrassed.

768
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,920
But I know,

769
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,039
we have to be careful with our work recently.

770
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,800
If I were you,

771
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,119
I'd rather resign.

772
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,400
That's the difference

773
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,920
between you and the vice president,
