1
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,519
Yuan Ge,

2
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Sun Bin,

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,079
Why are you here?

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,640
I've been transferred to the branch of this building.

5
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,120
That's right.

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
I remember your bank

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
is on the eighth floor.

8
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,480
When did you transfer here?

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
It's been a while.

10
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,599
You should have told me earlier.

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Come here.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
I should have invited you to dinner.

13
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,280
When I thought you were so busy,

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
and we were so close,

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,199
Yes

17
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,719
Let's talk as we walk.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Sun Bin,

19
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't feel like I've seen you in a while,

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,520
You look thinner.

21
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,000
Really?

22
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,960
What's wrong?

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
It's okay.

24
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,479
After all,

25
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm useless.

26
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,039
How is Ling Ling?

27
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,120
The fever has gone down

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
and he's asleep now,

29
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,560
Miss Gu is with her

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,439
in her room.

31
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,560
Miss Gu,

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
you're back.

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,599
I just took my temperature again.

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,599
Everything is normal now.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,759
Now that you're back,

36
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,719
I'll leave first.

37
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,560
Mom,

38
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,240
Mom,

39
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,159
Mom, don't go!

40
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,080
Miss Gu,

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,759
let me see you off.

42
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
It's okay. I can go back by myself.

43
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,039
It doesn't matter.

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,080
Ling Ling's fever has gone down anyway.

45
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,400
Let me send you back.

46
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,480
I'll get going.

47
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,240
Thank you, Miss Gu.

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,439
Actually,

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,439
I moved out from Yuan Ge's house.

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
When did that happen?

51
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,040
It's been a while.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,879
You two had a fight?

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,399
We've made up.

54
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,360
Well,

55
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,920
Where do you live now?

56
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,040
I didn't expect

57
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,839
to see stars in Shanghai,

58
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,360
Am I right?

59
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Not only can you see the stars here,

60
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,639
but it's also very safe.

61
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,000
How did you find this place?

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
When I was little,

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,160
I used to come here

64
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,319
with a bunch of friends,

65
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,120
Back then,

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,199
it wasn't as beautiful as it is now.

67
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,279
But there is a small forest

68
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
with men and women,

69
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,839
When they come to date,

70
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,600
we come to peek.

71
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,439
When I was young,

72
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,920
I was curious,

73
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,480
One day,

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,240
my friends and I,

75
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
I saw a man

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
holding a woman,

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
After we walked into the woods,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
we followed them.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,519
Far away,

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
this,

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
It's hard for me to describe it.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
Go on.

83
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,120
My train of thought was interrupted.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,079
I can't make it up anymore.

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,199
By the way,

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
why did Sun Bin

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,959
come to see you today?

88
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
He was transferred

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,319
to the branch downstairs of our company.

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
What a coincidence

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,279
to meet

92
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,360
you two.

93
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,639
Actually, I don't think

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
he's in a good state today,

95
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,519
Did something

96
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,560
happen to him?

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Can you stop talking about

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,959
other men in front of me,

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,879
Didn't you mention it first?

100
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:51,720
Well,

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Then you don't have to hit me.

102
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,199
There are mosquitoes.

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,519
Maybe we should go home.

104
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,199
There are too many mosquitoes here.

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,279
I'm either at home

106
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,120
or in the company,

107
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,959
I'm suffocating.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,120
It's not easy to get out. Stay

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
a little longer.

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Stop scratching!

111
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,560
You'll get inflamed if you scratch your skin. It's okay

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
if you don't tell me.

113
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,240
When you say it, it starts to itch. Let me

114
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,199
scratch it for you.

115
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,000
Amazing.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
It won't itch once you scratch it.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,319
And then?

119
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,040
It's such a beautiful starry sky,

120
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,759
but you don't have

121
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,639
any mood at all.

122
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,279
Even if you want to think about

123
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,240
our future?

124
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,839
Have you thought about it?

125
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,319
Of course I thought about it.

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
What did you think about?

127
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,079
When we get married,

128
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,360
we don't have to live in the city.

129
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,680
We could move

130
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,959
a little farther from the city,

131
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,439
Build a small house.

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,319
The kind you decorate yourself.

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,079
Paint it yourself,

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,399
and bring our dad here.

135
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,399
Our dad lives on the first floor,

136
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,319
we live on the second floor,

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,079
Dad can do whatever he wants.

138
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,040
Raising flowers, grass, cats,

139
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,160
dogs and birds,

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,279
You can do whatever you want.

141
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,199
I'll stay at home with him.

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,319
I also work at home.

143
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,839
I won't go out to work.

144
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,200
What about me?

145
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,120
You can

146
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,240
do whatever you want.

147
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
It's fine if you want to stay home and take care of the kids.

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
What if you can't let go of Shu Mei?

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,240
Go back to Shumei.

150
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
I can be your vice president.

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,519
When Shumei goes public,

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
you'll be holding the shares,

153
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,279
Waiting for the dividend?

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
It's no easier than it is now.

155
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,639
By the way,

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
I think you can

157
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,399
get ready now.

158
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,279
First of all,

159
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,799
you need to train

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,279
some successors

161
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,440
who can be Gu Qiao Yi

162
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,240
Gu Qiao Er,

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,919
Gu Qiao,

164
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,879
I'm not talking about you,

165
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,440
You think too much.

166
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,960
Can you not

167
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,639
hit me so hard?

168
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm still your boyfriend.

169
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,679
Can you be gentle?

170
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,559
gentle

171
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,399
Mr. Xiong, thank you.

172
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:37,840
Here

173
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,559
I am,

174
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
The street lamp here is so dark,

175
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,279
and it's so far away.

176
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,080
Is it safe for a girl like you

177
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
to come back late?

178
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,799
The security is quite good.

179
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,519
I'm fine.

180
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,399
Gu Qiao,

181
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,120
wait for me.

182
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,519
Take this fruit

183
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,639
and eat it.

184
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,360
No, thanks.

185
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,039
Of course.

186
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,559
Take it as a thank you

187
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,720
for coming with Ling Ling today,

188
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
Thank you.

189
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,519
It's quite magical.

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,639
Where's Ling Ling?

191
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm afraid of living,

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
but I didn't expect to be so close to you.

193
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,240
It's getting late.

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,279
Go upstairs.

195
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,759
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,679
Don't be so polite to me in the future.

197
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,039
Take it carefully.

198
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,120
Then.

199
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,559
Drive safely.

200
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,519
Goodbye.

201
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,159
Goodbye.

202
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
If you didn't turn on the air conditioner every day,

203
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
why would you pay so much electricity?

204
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,639
Why didn't you tell me?

205
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,480
You waste electricity cooking

206
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
in your room every day?

207
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,720
I've lived here for so long.

208
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,759
What does it have to do

209
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,799
with me? Your husband.

210
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,360
Look at her,

211
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,759
I know.

212
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,919
She happened to be back.

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,399
Why don't you ask her?

214
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,480
After she moved in,

215
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
the electricity bill went up.

216
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
She should pay for it.

217
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,679
Why should I pay?

218
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,159
I really can't listen to this anymore.

219
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Gu Qiao works outside during the day,

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,679
what does it have to do with her?

221
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,600
You usually broadcast live,

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,080
with the lights on and the air conditioner on,

223
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,799
Did you send the electricity yourself?

224
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,240
Then why

225
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,399
didn't she go up before she came.

226
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,080
Since she came,

227
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,000
the electricity bill has gone up?

228
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,960
Hold on.

229
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
What happened?

230
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,320
The electricity bill came out this month.

231
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,639
Much more money than before.

232
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,120
How much more?

233
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,799
50 yuan,

234
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,039
50 yuan,

235
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,840
They quarreled over 50 yuan.

236
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes.

237
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,639
It's because of 50 yuan.

238
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,480
It's because of you.

239
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,759
So you have to pay for it,

240
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
why should she pay for it?

241
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,919
It's a big deal. We'll share it equally.

242
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,200
All right, I'll do it.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,159
Stop arguing.

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,559
No.

245
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,720
My friend brought me some fruits.

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,840
Let's eat together.

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,440
We all live under the same roof,

248
00:11:59,519 --> 00:11:59,960
so there's no need

249
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,440
to quarrel over such a trivial matter.

250
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,679
It's not good even if you hurt your anger.

251
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
Come on,

252
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,559
All right, stop it.

253
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,159
Thank you.

254
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,559
Have some fruit to calm down.

255
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,039
Yeah, calm down.

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
And you too,

257
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,639
I mean,

258
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,120
you usually live under the same roof,

259
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,519
Don't worry too much.

260
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,559
All right,

261
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,840
go to bed early.

262
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,639
Let's go.

263
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,519
-Let's go. -Thank you.

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,480
Let's go.

265
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,919
Let's go back and eat some fruit.

266
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,200
Gu Qiao, you can't do this.

267
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,639
Take out the money this time.

268
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,879
They'll think you're easy to bully.

269
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,240
I have to ask you to pay for it next time.

270
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,559
And this fruit,

271
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,360
you can't give it to this kind of person.

272
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,080
It's not worth it.

273
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,799
All right,

274
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,039
isn't it only a few tens of yuan?

275
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,600
This time it's tens of yuan?

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,080
Hundreds in a year.

277
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,600
How many things can I buy

278
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
for a few hundred dollars?

279
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,360
This time it's the electricity bill,

280
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,320
and next time it's the water bill.

281
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,279
And the gas bill.

282
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,279
Every little makes a mickle,

283
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,960
You don't even know how much it costs.

284
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay, okay.

285
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,799
Come on,

286
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,240
Have some fruit to calm down.

287
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,759
You've never rented a house.

288
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,679
You don't know that.

289
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,759
I'm afraid you'll suffer.

290
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,360
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Hurry up. Eat

292
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,240
this banana. It's so sweet and delicious.

293
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,080
Eat more if it tastes good.

294
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,559
I'll give them all to you.

295
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,919
Thank you.

296
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,639
By the way,

297
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,759
when I first came back,

298
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,919
I saw two packages for you,

299
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,879
so I brought them back for you.

300
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,720
Thank you.

301
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,000
Isn't this Mr. Yuan?

302
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,639
You two see each other every day,

303
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,000
and she sends you photos,

304
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,639
I just want you to think about her

305
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,600
all the time.

306
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,759
Then.

307
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,960
You won't

308
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,600
move back to Mr. Yuan's place.

309
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,399
Don't worry,

310
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,080
I won't.

311
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,799
Then I'm relieved.

312
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,120
Hey,

313
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,000
Hey,

314
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,759
Miss Gu,

315
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
Ling Ling is much better today.

316
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,320
The weather is good too.

317
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,600
She said she wants to go on an outing,

318
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,919
and she wants you to go with her.

319
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
Are you free?

320
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,279
Okay.

321
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,320
That's great.

322
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,399
Clean it up first.

323
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
I'll pick you up later.

324
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
She's still asleep.

325
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,639
I'm not looking for her.

326
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,399
I'm looking for you.

327
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,519
You want to see me?

328
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,039
What is it?

329
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,879
Can I come in?

330
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,240
Come in.

331
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,759
I see you have a lot of clothes,

332
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,080
but you don't look heavy

333
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
every day.

334
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,440
I bought them before.

335
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,279
You're using

336
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,759
high-end cosmetics,

337
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,120
It's the same as before. Aren't you

338
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,120
from the same company

339
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,159
as Wang Mei?

340
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,679
I think you've earned a lot

341
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,559
more than her.

342
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,200
You,

343
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,320
What do you want from me?

344
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,840
Well,

345
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,159
I have an appointment today.

346
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,039
I think you have a lot of bags.

347
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,679
Can you lend me one?

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,679
My bag was sent to the nurse.

349
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,440
Forget it if you say no.

350
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,600
It's okay. Pick one.

351
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,279
Thank you.

352
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,399
Do you have lipstick in this color?

353
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,320
I've been wanting to buy it for a long time

354
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,519
but I haven't been able to.

355
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,000
Can you lend it to me too?

356
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,639
Here,

357
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,120
It's okay. I'll take it

358
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,519
after you use it.

359
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,679
It's okay. I'll use something else.

360
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,960
Thank you.

361
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,559
You scared the hell out of me.

362
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,679
Yesterday's 50 yuan,

363
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,720
we shouldn't have

364
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,799
pushed her luck and brazenly,

365
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm so pissed off!

366
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,599
Everyone lives together.

367
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,359
You woke up a long time ago.

368
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
If she wakes you up,

369
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,079
go back to sleep.

370
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,039
Anyway, it's the weekend.

371
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,720
Sister is here.

372
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,599
Hurry up!

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,599
Gu Qiao Ling Ling,

374
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,440
do you miss me?

375
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,400
Yes.

376
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,640
Is it hard now?

377
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,559
With Gu Qiao playing with me,

378
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,759
it won't be hard for me.

379
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,680
Ling Ling,

380
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,599
your mouth is getting sweeter and sweeter.

381
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,240
You're getting better at talking, aren't you?

382
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,839
Let's go.

383
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,720
Okay,

384
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,880
Let's go then.

385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
-Let's go. -Okay, let's go.

386
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,240
Let's hold hands.

387
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,759
You guys sit in the back and play.

388
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,599
Come on,

389
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,519
Let's sit in the back.

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,119
So careful.

391
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
Come and catch me. Wait for me.

392
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,279
Come and catch me!

393
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
Be careful, Ling Ling.

394
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,039
You can't catch up with me.

395
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,759
You can't catch me.

396
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,119
Let's see if I can catch up with you

397
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,400
and catch you.

398
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,039
Be careful.

399
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,799
Gu Qiao, come and catch me.

400
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,839
I'll catch you soon.

401
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,599
You can't catch me. You can't

402
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:33,960
chase me.

403
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,119
Got it.

404
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,440
Got it. Got it.

405
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,079
Ling Ling,

406
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,000
look,

407
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is Peppa Pig.

408
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,599
Do you like it?

409
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes,

410
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,359
I like cookies too

411
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,279
Don't run!

412
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,480
Thank you, Dad.

413
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,920
You can't catch me.

414
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,319
Wait for me.

415
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,880
Stop running!

416
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,799
I can't catch him.

417
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,559
I can't catch it.

418
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,640
Don't run. I can't catch you.

419
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Ling Ling, do you want to go over there?

420
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes

421
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,680
I'll take you there, okay?

422
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,839
Sure. Dad,

423
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,279
come with us.

424
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,920
Me,

425
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:09,880
That's right.

426
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,519
Please, Dad.

427
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,279
Catch me.

428
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,400
Okay. Dad will go with you.

429
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,400
That's great.

430
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,559
Let's go.

431
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,759
Come on, let's go.

432
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Let's go together.

433
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,279
Be careful.

434
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,640
Let's go!

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,640
Let's go.

436
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,119
Let's go.

437
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,400
Here we go.

438
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Run.

439
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,240
Run! Run!

440
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,079
Over here. Over here.

441
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,519
Don't arrest me.

442
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,920
Don't arrest me.

443
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,599
Are you

444
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,920
okay?

445
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,920
Thank you for your hard work.

446
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,279
Let's do it again, okay?

447
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,480
Okay,

448
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,240
Come on,

449
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,440
Come on.

450
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,759
Hold on, hold on,

451
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,960
the eagle is coming.

452
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,960
Stop running!

453
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,519
I'm here.

454
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,319
Don't arrest me!

455
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,839
Run. Don't get caught.

456
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,799
Keep up.

457
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,880
Come to my house tonight.

458
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll make you a nice meal,

459
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,559
and we'll watch

460
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,599
a movie together tonight.

461
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,559
What's wrong?

462
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,680
I suddenly don't want to go out.

463
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,519
After thinking about it,

464
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,160
home is the safest place.

465
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,839
What do you think?

466
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,000
Pack up.

467
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,079
I'll pick you up later.

468
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,279
I need to take this.

469
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
I'll go back to you later.

470
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,000
Hello, Aunt Sun.

471
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,559
What's wrong?

472
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,519
Well,

473
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,000
can you help me?

474
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,480
I really can't

475
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,920
find anyone to help me.

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Auntie, what's wrong?

477
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,599
What happened?

478
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,359
My Sun Bin is missing,

479
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
so I called him a lot.

480
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
He just didn't pick up.

481
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,720
What's going on?

482
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
How could Sun Bin be missing?

483
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,160
It's all Auntie's fault.

484
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,599
Auntie pushed him too hard.

485
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,799
Well,

486
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,000
Yuan Ge,

487
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,119
if something really happens

488
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,920
to Sun Bin,

489
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,519
You,

490
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,200
What do you want me to do?

491
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,640
I can't live.

492
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,720
Aunty,

493
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,519
aunty, don't worry.

494
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,799
Let me contact him for you.

495
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,039
The good

496
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,680
one,

497
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,160
Yuan Ge

498
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
Auntie, thank you.

499
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Thank you.

500
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,160
Sun Bin,

501
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,279
where are you?

502
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,119
Hey,

503
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,880
Who called you just now?

504
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,720
Son Bin's mother,

505
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,480
you're still in touch with his mother.

506
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,720
No,

507
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,039
Aunt Sun and Sun Bin had a fight,

508
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,039
Sun Bin ran away from home in a fit of pique.

509
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
Aunt Sun had no choice

510
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,359
but to look for me.

511
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,400
What do you mean?

512
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
If you don't come to me now,

513
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,720
you're going to mediate

514
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,119
the relationship between their mother and son.

515
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,799
Then I.

516
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,720
I'll go home

517
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,920
and have dinner with you tonight, okay?

518
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
If I say no,

519
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
you won't go?

520
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,640
Be obedient.

521
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,480
Wait for me.

522
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,039
Aunt Sun couldn't get in touch with you.

523
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,319
I was worried sick.

524
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,680
Ever since I was a kid,

525
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,960
I've always been like this.

526
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,359
As long as I don't agree

527
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,319
with her at all.

528
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,319
She would cry and make a scene.

529
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
To let everyone in the world know,

530
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,400
I thought Shanghai

531
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,079
would be different.

532
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,000
What on earth happened?

533
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,599
You know,

534
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,319
in my mom's heart,

535
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,319
Only a good girl like you

536
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,440
is good enough for me.

537
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,279
But my girlfriend,

538
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,480
she doesn't meet her requirements at all.

539
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,559
So because of this,

540
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:44,920
you didn't answer

541
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,039
Aunt Sun's call?

542
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,559
My girlfriend will be 30 soon,

543
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,680
and her family gave her an ultimatum,

544
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,640
If she doesn't get married this year,

545
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,359
she'll have to go back to her hometown for a blind date.

546
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,319
Otherwise,

547
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,039
break up with her.

548
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,359
In this era,

549
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
how come there are such parents?

550
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,960
Yes,

551
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
a reasonable parent

552
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
like Uncle Yuan.

553
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
It's really too little.

554
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,640
You're lucky.

555
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm sorry

556
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:29,960
for what I just said,

557
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,880
That's not what I meant.

558
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,599
I'm just expressing

559
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,799
my feelings. I know.

560
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,400
My mom loves me very much.

561
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,799
But in everything,

562
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,359
I have to do what she wants.

563
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,039
I'm so depressed.

564
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
Sometimes I want to,

565
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,200
or forget it.

566
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,799
That's it.

567
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,599
Just die.

568
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,200
Sun Bin,

569
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
how can you think like this?

570
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,160
A few days ago,

571
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,200
my girlfriend's family

572
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
forced her again.

573
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
She came to make a scene with me.

574
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,680
I really have no other choice.

575
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,559
That's why I took her to see my mom.

576
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,240
I made a deal with my mom before,

577
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,400
not to embarrass her face to face,

578
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,960
She promised me to be fine.

579
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,440
What's the result?

580
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,319
As soon as my girlfriend entered the house,

581
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,680
she was disgusted from beginning to end,

582
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
You dislike her bad family background,

583
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,920
and her dress is not fashionable,

584
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,720
I don't think the gift I bought for her is touching.

585
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
He thinks his teeth are not white enough.

586
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,480
Later,

587
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,920
my girlfriend told me,

588
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,880
Even if we get married,

589
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,599
we can't

590
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,880
live with my mom,

591
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,640
Or she'll go back to her hometown,

592
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
and my mom told me,

593
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,480
If I don't break up with her,

594
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,400
she'll jump the Huangpu River.

595
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,480
If you were me,

596
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,440
what would you do?

597
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,960
I know.

598
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,640
It's all my fault.

599
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
I'm useless.

600
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Sun Bin,

601
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,880
calm down.

602
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,200
In this way,

603
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,240
there are always more problems than problems.

604
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,640
How about this?

605
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,519
Try talking to your aunt

606
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,880
and your girlfriend,

607
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,359
Have a good talk.

608
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,960
Maybe things will get better.

609
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,839
My girlfriend has gone back to her hometown.

610
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,400
I went to her house by car last night.

611
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,240
I've been standing at her door for the whole night.

612
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,319
She didn't even see me.

613
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,079
Hey,

614
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,039
Hey,

615
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
When are you coming back?

616
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,880
I'll be back soon.

617
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,599
Come back soon.

618
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,880
I've prepared everything.

619
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,279
Me,

620
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,039
I'll hang up now.

621
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:57,720
I'll tell you later,

622
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,400
you just drank wine,

623
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,559
How can you take medicine?

624
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,519
It's okay.

625
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:03,960
This medicine,

626
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
I've been eating it for years.

627
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,720
I often take the wineshop.

628
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,039
Well,

629
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,039
Well,

630
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,759
you should go back now.

631
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,839
Mr. Du is waiting for you, right?

632
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,000
Also.

633
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,920
I have depression,

634
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
can you keep it a secret for me?

635
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,039
I don't want to be seen as crazy.

636
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Sun Bin,

637
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,119
why didn't you answer my call?

638
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,480
You,

639
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,000
Where did you go?

640
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
-You're driving me crazy. -Aunt Sun

641
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,599
Bin,

642
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,839
Bin Sun

643
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,400
He went on a business trip

644
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,680
yesterday. He didn't have a good rest.

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Let him have a good sleep.

646
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,519
When he wakes up,

647
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,680
you can talk to him.

648
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,400
Yuan Ge, thank you.

649
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,960
Thank you.

650
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,160
Auntie, you're welcome.

651
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
I have something else to do.

652
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,839
I'll get going.

653
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,119
I won't let you stay.

654
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,799
Auntie, please go inside.

655
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,559
Okay.

656
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,920
Thank you.

657
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,519
You're welcome.

658
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,480
Come on,

659
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,759
This is,

660
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,359
when we were playing the game,

661
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,839
Your feet are worn out.

662
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,240
Let me apply some medicine for you.

663
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
I'll do it myself.

664
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,799
It's okay.

665
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:04,680
I'll do it.

666
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,519
Does it hurt?

667
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,720
Hang in there.

668
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,000
All right,

669
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,319
thank you.

670
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,279
Thank you for coming today.

671
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,119
Ling Ling is happier

672
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,960
to be with you.

673
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,880
You are a great contributor today.

674
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,119
I'm back.

675
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,119
What a feast.

676
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,760
Isn't it just for a while?

677
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
Why is it so long?

678
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,679
Can we start eating now?

679
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm starving.

680
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,960
Punish yourself first.

681
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,280
Eat it.

682
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,480
It's getting cold.

683
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
What's wrong with Sun Bin?

684
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,039
Here's the thing,

685
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,719
Sun Bin's mother dislikes his girlfriend,

686
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,519
So I messed up the two of them.

687
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,519
Sun Bin ran away from home

688
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,760
in a fit of pique.

689
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
She didn't answer Aunt Sun's calls.

690
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,159
Aunt Sun can only ask me for help.

691
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,199
What did I think it was?

692
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,440
Isn't it just a breakup?

693
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,920
You look like a high school student.

694
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,840
He's been in Shanghai for so many years,

695
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,880
but you're his only friend?

696
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,079
I have to find you.

697
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:41,920
All right, all right.

698
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:42,920
Don't be mad.

699
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm back now, aren't I?

700
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,960
Why did you pour me so much?

701
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
All right, all right.

702
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,440
Eat first. The dishes

703
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,280
will get cold later.

704
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,239
Sister is home.

705
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,920
I'll play with you next time.

706
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,599
Okay?

707
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,039
Sister,

708
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,159
why don't you stay at our house.

709
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
Then Ling Ling can play with you

710
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,519
every day.

711
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,679
I promise,

712
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,280
I'll spare more time

713
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,519
to play with Ling Ling in the future, okay?

714
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,679
You have to keep your word.

715
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,400
Don't worry,

716
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,360
Pull the hook.

717
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,960
Smile.

718
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
I'm leaving.

719
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,079
Bye, sister.

720
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,039
Goodbye. Goodbye.

721
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,280
Goodbye.

722
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,880
I'll go in first.

723
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,800
Go to bed early.

724
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,519
Goodbye. Goodbye.

725
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:18,840
Goodbye.

726
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,400
Wang Mei,

727
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,960
did you see my package?

728
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,199
No.

729
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,719
Aren't they all

730
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,840
in the meter box at the door?

731
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,119
Why don't you go to the living room?

732
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:54,920
Let's see if someone

733
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,719
brought it back for you.

734
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,119
Okay. I'll ask

735
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,519
if you've seen my package?

736
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,239
No.

737
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:12,800
We haven't been home

738
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
all day. What's wrong?

739
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,960
Did you lose the delivery?

740
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,480
Well,

741
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,519
I'm sorry,

742
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,400
I didn't see the name clearly.

743
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,000
I thought it was mine.

744
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,159
I'm fine.

745
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,679
Mr. Xiong,

746
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,480
David,

747
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,480
David,

748
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,840
long time no see,

749
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,519
Long time no see.

750
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:55,280
The last time we met

751
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,360
was at the US headquarters, right?

752
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,960
Yeah,

753
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,239
I didn't have time to congratulate you.

754
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,199
Transfer to the headquarters.

755
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,199
Thank you.

756
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:01,800
Please have a seat.

757
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,480
What do you think?

758
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,480
As always,

759
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,159
have some tea,

760
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,039
Okay.

761
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,159
It's more comfortable in the country.

762
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,440
At the headquarters in the United States,

763
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,159
what am I doing

764
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,960
under the nose of the boss?

765
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,119
You have to be careful.

766
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes.

767
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,039
What

768
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,000
brings you here.

769
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,320
Thank you.

770
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Don't tell me

771
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,719
you're here to discuss business in person,

772
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,840
We're on the same side,

773
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,159
so I won't beat around the bush.

774
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,159
You know Baolai Group

775
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,280
has always attached great importance to the domestic market.

776
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,280
So he spends a lot of time and money

777
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,239
at home,

778
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,119
Of course,

779
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,400
Guangke

780
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
and 20 brands

781
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,760
of Baolai Group,

782
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,760
We've always maintained

783
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,159
deep friendship and cooperation.

784
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,599
And what about the key performance indicators

785
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,360
of our company every year?

786
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,159
One third of them

787
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,119
are from your company.

788
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:48,559
Right?

789
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,559
Let's put it this way,

790
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,880
although Borai Group

791
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,639
has a place

792
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,719
in the world's top 500 every year.

793
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,199
But in the past few years,

794
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,760
the global market share

795
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,239
has been declining year by year.

796
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,880
So over the past few years,

797
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,400
you've been focusing on the whole world,

798
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,719
Constantly expanding market share

799
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,639
through acquisitions,

800
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,639
But it didn't work well.

801
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,760
So?

802
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,119
The headquarters has decided

803
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,719
to focus and focus

804
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,519
back to China.

805
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,239
When I come back,

806
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,679
I just want to ask Mr. Xiong

807
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
to do me a favor.

808
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,920
Go ahead.

809
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,800
Borai Group wants to acquire Shumei?

810
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,760
If you want to buy Shumei,

811
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,559
you want to enter

812
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,559
the field of skin care products,

813
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,880
Because as you all know,

814
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:39,760
Shu Mei,

815
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,599
But among the local

816
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,880
skin care brands in China,

817
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
He's the best.

818
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,559
Although we're taking the cheap route,

819
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,440
we have a very high market share,

820
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,360
So,

821
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,239
if Baolai Group

822
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,280
can acquire Shumei,

823
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,400
This will help us

824
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,320
to get through the channels,

825
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,960
You can

826
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,840
talk to Shu Mei

827
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,719
about this,

828
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,800
I don't seem to be able to help.

829
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,559
Mr. Xiong,

830
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,880
don't reject me in a hurry.

831
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,880
I already know.

832
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,039
Your Guangke Company

833
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,480
is a strategic partnership with Shumei.

834
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,960
Am I right?

835
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,480
Besides,

836
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,400
you helped their sub-brand, Li Meng,

837
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
to be so successful.

838
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,599
I believe

839
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,639
Shumei's boss,

840
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,559
He must trust you very much.

841
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,840
So for the acquisition,

842
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
if you're the one who helped me with it,

843
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,519
Then I will get twice the result with half the effort.

844
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,159
David,

845
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,960
Mr. Xiong,

846
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,239
This favor

847
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,760
won't be in vain.

848
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,960
Have some tea,
