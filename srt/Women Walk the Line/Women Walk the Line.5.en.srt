1
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,159
You don't know,

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,920
when that channel dealer

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,560
came in just now,

4
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,840
You scared the hell out of me.

5
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,599
You look like you're going to kill someone.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you think

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,599
Mr. Du can handle them?

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
He,

9
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,439
a scholar meets a soldier,

10
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't know if it makes sense.

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
No one can handle this kind of person

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,040
except my master.

13
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,560
Look at this.

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,319
It's so funny.

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,120
Brother Bao,

16
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,959
is Mr. Fu really going to buy Li Meng?

17
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,800
This guy

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,479
I can understand that you're being strict.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,919
You'll die if you smile.

20
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,199
He only smiles at one person.

21
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,520
Who is it?

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,520
Hello,

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,319
check out the spa,

24
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,560
No need.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
We have an event.

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,520
Hello,

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,039
Boss,

28
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,080
Do you have a pen?

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,439
I need a pen.

30
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,960
Yes,

31
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,120
can you lend it to me?

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Okay,

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,719
thank you.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,639
Okay,

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,360
thank you.

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Can you lend me

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,719
the table outside?

38
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,879
Sure. Feel free to use it.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,000
Boss, you're so nice.

40
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,639
Thank you.

41
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,560
Okay. You're welcome.

42
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,879
-Hello. -The spa. -No, no, no. -Hello.

43
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,800
The

44
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,919
spa.

45
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,599
I don't need it. I can

46
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,759
go with my sister.

47
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,439
-No, thank you. -Okay.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
The spa.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Okay,

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Take a look at the spa,

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,800
we

52
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,400
Give me another one.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,159
Okay.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,919
We have a lot of blood-tonifying

55
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,439
and beauty treatments here,

56
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,680
As well as those who make essential oil back massage,

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,759
they're all fine,

58
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,879
So pretty.

59
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,120
Gu Qiao,

60
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,959
Kexin,

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,519
It's really you.

62
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,360
I didn't dare to admit it just now.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
You didn't go home and get married

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,560
as soon as you graduated,

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
Are you a young lady now?

66
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,000
Why are you in Shanghai?

67
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm here to play with Yuan Ge.

68
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,680
Why are you dressed like this?

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
It's like a salesperson.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
You don't understand.

71
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,839
This is the trend this year.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Okay,

73
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,800
If you have time these two days, just let me know,

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,759
and ask your old classmates to come.

75
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,800
Let's get together.

76
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,160
Sure. Keep in touch.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,399
I'll get going then.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,439
Little girl,

79
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,439
can you,

80
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,160
Don't hand out leaflets here.

81
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,439
I'll follow you.

82
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,360
I've been sweeping all the way from there to here.

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,639
If you keep sending it like this,

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,639
when can I finish

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,519
sweeping the floor?

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,879
Auntie, I'm sorry. You don't know

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,399
how to protect the environment.

88
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,639
The leaflets have been handed out.

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,079
It's done.

90
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,680
So soon?

91
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,399
You didn't just throw it in the trash can.

92
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:46,879
No.

93
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,279
I sent them one by one.

94
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,279
By the way,

95
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,639
Gu Qiao

96
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,839
I need to ask you something.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,639
Ms. Cleaner,

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
I have something to do at home today.

99
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,519
No. Where

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,759
are the other colleagues?

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,759
We all have customers to serve.

102
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,560
After that,

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,279
clean up the common room,

104
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,560
Clean it up before you get off work.

105
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,079
Okay,

106
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,800
Thank you for your hard work.

107
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,319
Your call.

108
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,879
Hurry up!

109
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,000
One more round.

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,519
15, 15,

111
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,600
Director,

112
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,160
Why is the store closed?

113
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,759
Of course it's closed after work.

114
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,680
Don't close the door and wait for the thief to steal it.

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,399
But I'm still in the shop.

116
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,560
Really?

117
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,399
When I closed the door,

118
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,240
I shouted several times that no one was there.

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,199
Director, can you come back

120
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,439
and open the door for me?

121
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,519
Okay,

122
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,000
Cheers!

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,439
No way.

124
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,639
I have something to do outside.

125
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,519
Let me tell you,

126
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,959
There's a pipe in the kitchen.

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,959
You're so thin,

128
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm sure I can get out of here.

129
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,879
Why don't you climb out from there.

130
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm busy.

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
You can drink a lot.

132
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,200
That's it.

133
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,039
Come on.

134
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,600
Cheers! Cheers!

135
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,799
Cheers! Cheers!

136
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,799
Gu Qiao.

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,840
Gu Qiao.

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
It's late.

139
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,159
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

140
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,879
Sorry,

141
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,639
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

142
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,720
Where can we go at this hour?

143
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,039
What's wrong with you?

144
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,720
Liang,

145
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,159
he bullied me,

146
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,639
It's okay now.

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,720
It's okay now.

148
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,080
He bullied me.

149
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,879
Hello, Miss Yang.

150
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Busy man.

151
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,759
I finally found you.

152
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Sorry,

153
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm in a meeting this afternoon,

154
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,159
Are you free tomorrow night?

155
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,919
I have an appointment with a man for you,

156
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,320
all kinds of conditions,

157
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,279
They are all very good.

158
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,240
Okay,

159
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,960
Let's make an appointment later tomorrow.

160
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,320
All right,

161
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
let's do it according to your time.

162
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,200
When the time and place are set,

163
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,840
I'll send it to you.

164
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Yang.

165
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,279
That's it. I'm hanging up.

166
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
Tell me about you,

167
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,120
in this case,

168
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,360
You can call the unlocking company

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,039
or call the police.

170
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,519
Even if you break down the door,

171
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,320
you'll be fine.

172
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,440
If he asks you to climb the pipe, you can climb it.

173
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,639
Besides,

174
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,679
Even if your phone is out of battery,

175
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,320
you can just call a taxi,

176
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,679
Call me

177
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,519
from the taxi driver's phone,

178
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,679
He asked me to pay downstairs.

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,720
It's such a long way.

180
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,879
Are you going to walk back?

181
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,480
What if

182
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,559
I get lost?

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,279
Thank you.

184
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,600
I have no experience, right?

185
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,840
And in the past,

186
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,159
Luan Yu was in charge of all these things.

187
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,960
I don't care about these things at all.

188
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,159
Don't mention that man.

189
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,960
Do you think

190
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,159
I'm useless.

191
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,799
No.

192
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,320
I think

193
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,159
you're not only very useful,

194
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,679
And you worked very hard.

195
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
Really?

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,480
If you don't work hard,

197
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,279
why are there so many people?

198
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,720
You marked your phone

199
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,120
as a harassing call?

200
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,279
Yuan Ge,

201
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,720
why are you smiling?

202
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,120
Laugh again and I'll eat you.

203
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,120
Eat yours.

204
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,679
I'm not hungry.

205
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,080
Take your time.

206
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm going to take a shower.

207
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,320
Ge Ge,

208
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,600
I love you.

209
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,440
It's delicious.

210
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,399
Why didn't you knock?

211
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,240
I met with the channel last night,

212
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,039
but I was kicked out.

213
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,440
I've asked a lot of people,

214
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,559
and they said you've been the one

215
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,279
who's been handling the channel business these years.

216
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,360
How did you handle it?

217
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,360
If I can teach you a few words

218
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
about my experience

219
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,759
in the past few years,

220
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,519
Isn't it a waste of time for me?

221
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,039
Then I'm not doomed.

222
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,639
Oh no.

223
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,519
I've already made an appointment with them.

224
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,679
We're having dinner tonight,

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
not to help you.

226
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm afraid

227
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,639
you'll embarrass Shumei.

228
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,440
Yes.

229
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,600
Shumei, don't embarrass yourself.

230
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,960
See you tonight.

231
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,879
I didn't call you.

232
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,279
Mr. Yuan,

233
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,279
where are the three of us?

234
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,240
I have a lot of things to do every day.

235
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,200
I came to the company this time,

236
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,720
not to make things difficult for you.

237
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,559
Think about it.

238
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
It's Shumei's 10th anniversary.

239
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,159
The number of products per year,

240
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,759
and the advertising time?

241
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,759
There is a fixed number.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Now suddenly

243
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,360
there's a high-end brand,

244
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,879
The advertising of

245
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,960
our existing products,

246
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,120
And will the quantity of this product

247
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
be affected?

248
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,799
Yes,

249
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,480
you want to build a high-end brand,

250
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,279
No one told us in advance.

251
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,120
No one

252
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,240
has ever said hello to us.

253
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,279
Or

254
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,759
are you just going to do it quietly?

255
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
When everything is done,

256
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,159
you can tell us,

257
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,679
If we don't agree,

258
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,639
you're going to

259
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,679
kick us out.

260
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,159
Right?

261
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,320
Of course the company

262
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,240
doesn't mean that.

263
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,360
Manager Liang,

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,840
as you know,

265
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,480
I ran out of those shops

266
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,879
one by one.

267
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,919
You have feelings,

268
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,919
so do I.

269
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,679
Don't worry,

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,519
it won't affect

271
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,679
the interests of our store,

272
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,200
Here's to you.

273
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,639
Manager Niu,

274
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,480
we're working together now.

275
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
After all these years,

276
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,200
what kind of person am I, Yuan Ge?

277
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm sure you know it well,

278
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,919
so I'll put it here today.

279
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,799
If it's because of

280
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
our advertising problem,

281
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,119
If the product is unsalable,

282
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,039
we can directly recover it at the selling price.

283
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,319
What do you think?

284
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,640
Yes,

285
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,960
I have no problem

286
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,039
with the way you handle it.

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,720
Drink it.

288
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,920
Ms. Zhang,

289
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,319
the annual supply,

290
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,240
You have the most.

291
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,680
I, Yuan Ge, remember it in my heart.

292
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,960
Don't worry,

293
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,359
not to mention sub-brands,

294
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,599
I haven't left the character yet.

295
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,160
Even if we have a sub-brand,

296
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,920
the number of products we can supply you every year

297
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,440
will never decrease.

298
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,440
Come on,

299
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,200
Here's a toast

300
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,799
to you.

301
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,279
Okay,

302
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,119
Yuan Ge,

303
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,359
with what you said,

304
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,720
Sister, I'm relieved.

305
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,799
Yuan Ge,

306
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,000
you are a very good

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,440
female entrepreneur in China,

308
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,279
We should cooperate more in the future,

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,519
cooperate more,

310
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,359
Hurry up.

311
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,240
You didn't drink enough today?

312
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,039
Come again next time.

313
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,440
Okay,

314
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,079
I'll visit you next time.

315
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay,

316
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,480
Be careful.

317
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,559
Be careful.

318
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,359
Mr. Yuan,

319
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,359
have a good time today.

320
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
As long as you're happy. Manager Liang,

321
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,920
be careful.

322
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:36,559
Okay,

323
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
-Bye. -Bye, sir.

324
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,640
Slow down,

325
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,720
Be careful.

326
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,119
Goodbye.

327
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,640
Are you okay?

328
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,440
You're drunk.

329
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,119
Let me send you back.

330
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,000
It's none of your business.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,680
Mind your own business.

332
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,200
See you tomorrow.

333
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,079
Yuan Ge.

334
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,640
It's really you.

335
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,119
Why did you drink so much?

336
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,599
It's okay.

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
Let me go.

338
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,680
Let me send you home.

339
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,359
No need

340
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,319
-What? -No. Nothing.

341
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:23,720
It's late.

342
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,400
No need.

343
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
I said no need.

344
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,920
I really don't need you to drive me home.

345
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,720
I can go back by myself.

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,599
Come on, mind your own business.

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,759
Mind your own business.

348
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Yuan Ge,

349
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,440
where is your address?

350
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,559
Yuan Ge.

351
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,119
Ge Ge,

352
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,839
Ge Ge

353
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,559
Why hasn't he come back yet?

354
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,039
Sorry,

355
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,880
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

356
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,599
Sorry,

357
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,640
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

358
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Turn it off.

359
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,039
Hey,

360
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,000
Hello, Mr. Du.

361
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,359
Do you know where Ge Ge is?

362
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,000
It's so late and you haven't come home yet.

363
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,720
I called her

364
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
and her phone was off,

365
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,440
With her boyfriend.

366
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,880
Boyfriend?

367
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,000
Why didn't I know?

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
She has a boyfriend.

369
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,720
You don't even know that,

370
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,039
She has a boyfriend, right?

371
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,119
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

372
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,119
Who was the man

373
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:41,799
who picked her up just now?

374
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,160
How would I know?

375
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,599
But some time ago,

376
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,240
she registered a member

377
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,000
on the dating website,

378
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,559
With such high efficiency,

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,240
Marriage and Love Network,

380
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,559
All right, I'm done. I'm going to

381
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,759
take a shower.

382
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,440
Bye. Boring.

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,279
Why did you tell me in the shower?

384
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,119
Wake up.

385
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,640
Where is this place?

386
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,519
Why am I here?

387
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,559
You were drunk last night.

388
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,599
Where do you live?

389
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,400
You didn't tell me,

390
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,079
and then you fell asleep.

391
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,440
I can only bring you here.

392
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,000
Why didn't you wake me up?

393
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,799
What are you talking about?

394
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,440
With the way you drank yesterday,

395
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,200
I think even if someone

396
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,920
beat you up.

397
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,759
You won't wake up either.

398
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,519
Come on. I made breakfast.

399
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,519
-Have some. -No,

400
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,960
thanks.

401
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,279
Well,

402
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,000
Yesterday,

403
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,119
Thank you.

404
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,160
If you're free tonight,

405
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,359
I'll treat you to dinner.

406
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,440
You're back.

407
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Ge Ge,

408
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:15,680
You.

409
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,599
Hey,

410
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,359
You finally answered the phone.

411
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
If you don't come to meet me, at least let me know,

412
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,559
the young man

413
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,359
has been waiting for you for more than two hours.

414
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,079
Sorry,

415
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,200
I had something to do last night.

416
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,400
I can't offend my other clients

417
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,799
because of you.

418
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,799
You smashed my signature

419
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,039
as a gold matchmaker,

420
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
I'll tell our leader,

421
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,119
and refund

422
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,079
your membership fee.

423
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,359
I don't want to earn your money anymore.

424
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,839
Tell me honestly,

425
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,240
are you in love?

426
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,400
Who said I was in a relationship?

427
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,559
Where did you stay last night?

428
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
I was drunk last night.

429
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,759
I slept on my own.

430
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,279
I'm going to take a shower first.

431
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Ge Ge,

432
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,640
you've changed.

433
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,839
But now you're hiding it from me.

434
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,279
You don't even talk to me anymore.

435
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm so sad.

436
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,319
I'm really not in a relationship,

437
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,680
okay?

438
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,880
If you don't want to say it,

439
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,039
don't say it.

440
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,799
Gu Qiao,

441
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,759
I forgot my underwear.

442
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,559
Hold it for me.

443
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,440
Okay, I'll be right there.

444
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,960
Gu Qiao,

445
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,160
have you brought it?

446
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,799
I'm here.

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,359
Ge Ge, you're right

448
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,319
Gu Qiao,

449
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm running out of time.

450
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,720
Please iron my suit.

451
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,519
Good morning, Mr. Du,

452
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,319
Morning,

453
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,359
It's so early today.

454
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
I got up early.

455
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
Don't tell me this flower

456
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,640
is for Mr. Yuan again.

457
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,160
Zheng Jinnan's

458
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,960
suitor,

459
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,359
Does it have anything to do with you?

460
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
I'll bring the flowers to Mr. Yuan.

461
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,599
Thank you, Mr. Du.

462
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,079
This is what I should do.

463
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,200
Good morning, Mr. Du,

464
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,799
Morning.

465
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,640
Well.

466
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Good morning, Mr. Yuan.

467
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,839
Morning.

468
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,240
Mr. Du,

469
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,559
do you want to go to the bathroom?

470
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,799
Auntie,

471
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,359
you've been working hard,

472
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
On behalf of the company,

473
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,359
this bouquet of flowers is for you.

474
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,480
Don't drink too much

475
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,680
and take care of yourself.

476
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,480
Stay in a good mood.

477
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,160
Zheng Jinnan.

478
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,200
Ask someone for me.

479
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,079
Ge Ge

480
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,279
Why haven't you come back yet?

481
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,519
Ge Ge,

482
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,559
Qiao Qiao is starving to death.

483
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,599
I'll eat first.

484
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,640
I took the liberty of asking Mr. Fu

485
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,119
for your contact information.

486
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,880
If you're free tonight,

487
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,839
let's have dinner together,

488
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,319
At six o'clock,

489
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,839
I'll wait for you downstairs in your company.

490
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,119
Zheng Jinnan.

491
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,240
Yuan Ge,

492
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,480
are you still here?

493
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,599
I just contacted your colleague.

494
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,039
He said you're still working overtime?

495
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,759
So,

496
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,240
I didn't call you.

497
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,279
Sorry,

498
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,839
I didn't check my phone just now.

499
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,279
It's okay.

500
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,079
Come on,

501
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,200
This is for you.

502
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,680
This is.

503
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,359
That's all I want to say.

504
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,599
You haven't eaten yet, right?

505
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,839
It's late. I don't think

506
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,559
it's appropriate to ask you out for supper.

507
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,240
I don't know

508
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,160
what do you like to eat?

509
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,359
So I bought some

510
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,480
low calorie vegetarian food,

511
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,359
Don't you want to say that girls

512
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,279
are afraid of gaining weight?

513
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you.

514
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,119
I won't hold you up.

515
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,799
You should go back now.

516
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,039
Let's meet for dinner again,

517
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,720
Okay,

518
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,279
Goodbye. Goodbye.

519
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,160
Mr. Du,

520
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,480
I need you to sign a document.

521
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,039
Okay,

522
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,359
See you tonight.

523
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,119
Mr. Du,

524
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,279
what is it?

525
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,960
I need to talk to you

526
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,039
about something at work.

527
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,160
Let's have dinner together tonight,

528
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,119
and talk about

529
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,720
work over dinner. Let's talk about it now.

530
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,960
I have something to do

531
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,519
tonight. What is it? A date.

532
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,400
Personal matter?

533
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,679
All right. Let's talk about it

534
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,760
another day. Why are you here?

535
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,039
A movie?

536
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,639
Why don't you go to the cinema?

537
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:14,960
What do you think?

538
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,280
Do you like it?

539
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,880
Oh, right.

540
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,440
Don't worry.

541
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,920
I've got a designated driver.

542
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
Have you seen

543
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,639
Casablanca?

544
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,599
It's an old movie, isn't it?

545
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,559
No, I haven't.

546
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,559
Yes

547
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
In the drive-in cinema,

548
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,679
when it was popular in the 1950 s,

549
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,400
This movie

550
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,519
happened to be a hit,

551
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,519
Back then, Bette Higgins

552
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,119
watched this movie

553
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,360
with his girlfriend.

554
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,239
Then I wrote a song with the same name,

555
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,280
and proposed to her with this song.

556
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,199
That's why his girlfriend

557
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,360
became his wife.

558
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,320
I fell in love with you.

559
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
While watching Casablanca,

560
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,519
the lights in the back row of

561
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,639
the drive-in cinema flickered.

562
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,079
Popcorn and coke under the stars,

563
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,239
turned into champagne and caviar.

564
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,679
Love each other

565
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,400
on a long and hot summer night.

566
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,559
Hey,

567
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,599
What is it?

568
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,599
Do you have time?

569
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't have time.

570
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,320
About my contract with Li Meng,

571
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,360
I've sent it to your email.

572
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,760
Hurry up and take a look.

573
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,519
Okay,

574
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,719
I'll read it later.

575
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
The movie is about to start.

576
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,280
I'm sorry.

577
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,480
Hey,

578
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,840
I'm in a hurry.

579
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,960
We're waiting for a reply over there.

580
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,039
Hurry up and take a look.

581
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,360
When I'm done,

582
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,519
I'll be outside now,

583
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
Goodbye.

584
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
Is there something wrong?

585
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,519
It's okay.

586
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,000
Let's watch a movie.

587
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Sorry,

588
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,360
I need to take care of something at work,

589
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,760
Take your time.

590
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,559
I'll get going.

591
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,480
No,

592
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,559
what is it?

593
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,280
Let me give you a ride.

594
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,000
No, thanks. You drank too much.

595
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,320
I can take a taxi myself.

596
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,800
Hey,

597
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,840
Hello,

598
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,880
are you a designated driver?

599
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,039
Pick me up.

600
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,880
Ge Ge,

601
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,599
I'm leaving.

602
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:11,920
Why are you dressed like this?

603
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,599
Go to work

604
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,719
to save time,

605
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,760
Hello, President,

606
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:17,880
Yuan Ge

607
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,239
Don't be late for the class reunion

608
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,119
this afternoon. I may not have time this afternoon.

609
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,760
Maybe next time.

610
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,519
President?

611
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,360
Which president?

612
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
The president of our student union

613
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,800
said that in the afternoon the class reunion,

614
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,039
Then why don't you go?

615
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,360
I went there once before.

616
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,320
It's not interesting.

617
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,760
I haven't been there since then.

618
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,039
What do you mean?

619
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,760
We were classmates in college for four years,

620
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,440
so we still need to contact each other occasionally.

621
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,360
Let me go with you.

622
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,920
Why do you want to go so badly all of a sudden?

623
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,159
because

624
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,639
I haven't seen you guys for a long time.

625
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,400
Besides,

626
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,440
for those who attend a class reunion,

627
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,239
They are all well-known.

628
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,039
If you're not doing well,

629
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,960
you won't go at all.

630
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,400
And these happen to be my

631
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,239
precise clients,

632
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:04,920
Such an opportunity,

633
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,280
how could I throw it away?

634
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,599
Think about it carefully.

635
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,280
Before that, everyone thought,

636
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,119
you went back to your hometown

637
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,400
to be a rich and wealthy young lady?

638
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,719
If you want to go like this,

639
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,840
when people ask,

640
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,519
What do you think?

641
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,039
Just say it.

642
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,280
Is this face more important than making money?

643
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,320
Now my goal in life is

644
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,440
to work hard to make money,

645
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:25,719
Okay,

646
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,519
Since you've made up your mind,

647
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,159
I'll send you the address later.

648
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay,

649
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,119
I'll get going then.

650
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,519
Enjoy your meal. Bye.

651
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,199
Goodbye.

652
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,119
What do you think?

653
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,000
I went home to change it.

654
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,119
Are you young?

655
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,119
Why are you dressed like this?

656
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,800
It's exactly the same as when we were in college.

657
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,719
That's right.

658
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm telling you,

659
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,760
This is my tactic,

660
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,679
to remind everyone of the time

661
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,719
when we were in school,

662
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,679
To regain the friendship we had back then.

663
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,119
And then?

664
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,559
And then,

665
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,719
this guy,

666
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,239
They were all visual animals,

667
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,000
and when he saw that

668
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,920
I was young,

669
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,679
I feel like

670
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,079
I'm a little old,

671
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,920
And then he wants

672
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,199
to maintain it,

673
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
To make myself younger.

674
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,719
At this time, if I sell it again,

675
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,159
I'll get twice the result with half the effort.

676
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,079
That makes sense.

677
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:34,960
So,

678
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,480
towards our battlefield.

679
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,480
Let's move forward.

680
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,199
Let's go.
