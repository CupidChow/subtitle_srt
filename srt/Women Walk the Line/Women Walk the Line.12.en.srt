1
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,040
Dad,

2
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,760
Ling Ling,

3
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,719
Why are you up?

4
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,560
Did you have a nightmare?

5
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,799
Give me a hug.

6
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,719
Dad,

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,560
Gu Qiao,

8
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,919
Don't you like Ling Ling?

9
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,199
How could it be?

10
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,280
Ling Ling is lovely and lovely,

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Gu Qiao likes you the most.

12
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,759
Then why didn't she come to see me?

13
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,120
Didn't you say

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,800
she was going to tutor me?

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,560
Gu Qiao has been busy lately,

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
and when she's done,

17
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
She will come to Lingling soon.

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,560
Okay?

19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,319
Ling Ling,

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,159
I'll tell you a story book,

21
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,840
Okay?

22
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,919
All right,

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,319
all right,

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,560
You're so reluctant.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,919
Give me a hug.

26
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,360
One, two, three,

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm telling you,

28
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,960
The story of Snow White,

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,439
okay?

30
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,960
Ge Ge, you're back.

31
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,879
You're back.

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Why are you so late?

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,039
Mr. Fu asked me

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
to talk about her daughter.

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,879
Actually,

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,319
sometimes I think,

37
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,479
It's not easy for her.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,719
It's not easy to be a woman.

39
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,800
It's not easy

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
for a strong woman.

41
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,000
Why are you suddenly angry?

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,319
The more people talk about me,

43
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,719
the more I have to show them.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,599
Gu Qiao,

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,360
I've made things clear

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,319
between us,

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,039
You don't mind, do you?

48
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,280
How can I blame you?

49
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,199
It's not too late for me to be moved.

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
In fact, these days

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,439
I've been working with them,

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,719
I wanted to tell them

53
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,879
several times.

54
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,120
But I want to rely on

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,319
my own ability,

56
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,919
Get their approval.

57
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
And I'm scared,

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
too. Do you think I'm your best friend?

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
If I don't work hard,

60
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,240
what makes you think that way?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,520
Now that I'm saying this,

62
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,240
I want to see

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,839
how tough I can be, right?

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm here.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
There's some pain.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,920
You don't have to eat it.

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
No, no, no.

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
You still have to eat what you deserve.

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
However,

70
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,319
you are so kind to me.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,839
Love you.

72
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,800
All right. It's eleven o'clock.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,959
Go to bed early.

74
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,120
Let's go to the company

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,319
tomorrow.

76
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,519
There's no need to hide it.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Let's go together.

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,560
What are you

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,639
afraid of?

80
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,480
Reading.

81
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,800
What's up?

82
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,959
No.

83
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,199
I just

84
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
suddenly realized,

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,279
So you like

86
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,680
Mr. Yuan,

87
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,120
What happened when Mr. Yuan hung up?

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
It's not good.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,839
Or am I not good enough for her?

90
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,480
No, no,

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,920
it's not a perfect match.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,959
A perfect match.

93
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,160
It's just that I didn't think of it before,

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,879
but I feel like,

95
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,800
She is the kind of female devil

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
in the workplace,

97
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,560
But when she stood up today,

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,319
the feeling of speaking for Gu Qiao.

99
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,199
I totally changed my mind about her.

100
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,720
You deserve

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
such a woman.

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,399
I support you.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't need your support.

104
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
Is there anything else?

105
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,480
Go play by yourself.

106
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,319
Don't disturb my reading.

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
You're holding the book upside down.

108
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,959
What did you say for Gu Qiao?

109
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,120
I went to have breakfast this morning.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,839
Knock on the door?

111
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,120
Come in,

112
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,439
I went to have breakfast this morning,

113
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,399
and I packed one for you.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
Thank you.

115
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,680
Honey,

116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
let's do a

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,360
questionnaire later,

118
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,639
This questionnaire survey,

119
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,399
you can do it online, right?

120
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,759
Why do you have to go by yourself?

121
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
Don't you know that too?

122
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,040
Those online users filled it out randomly,

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,399
but the final data is not accurate at all.

124
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,839
One-on-one offline is better.

125
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
Yanxi, it's not that I don't want to go.

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,240
I've been allergic to my face lately.

127
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,759
Look,

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,639
you can't see the sun.

129
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
I didn't ask you to stand on the street.

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
You can't go to the mall.

131
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,959
Yanxi,

132
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,920
let me go.

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
Miss Gu Qiao,

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,319
forget it. Let's go with Wang Mei.

135
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,079
She's done it and she's familiar with the process,

136
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,279
Gu Qiao, let me go.

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,399
You've done

139
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,399
so much.

140
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,360
Give it to me.

141
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll go with you.

142
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
Yanxi,

143
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,600
this has nothing to do with me.

144
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,519
If Mr. Yuan finds out,

145
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll assign my own work

146
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,519
to her best friend,

147
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,919
Will she be like

148
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,159
criticizing Xia Meng,

149
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,240
If you criticize me,

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
who are you blaming?

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Why did you push so hard

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,159
when I asked you to go in the first place,

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,200
From the very beginning,

154
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,559
you should leave it

155
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,679
to that intern.

156
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,080
Yanxi,

157
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,159
you've known

158
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,120
Yuan and Gu Qiao's relationship for a long time.

159
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

160
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,600
Master won't let me tell you,

161
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,320
and I've reminded you

162
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,679
two many times.

163
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,480
You,

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,360
Your reminder

165
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,679
was too polite.

166
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,279
Who would have thought of that?

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Enough

168
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
After that,

169
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,200
learn to be smart.

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,279
Sister Yanxi, don't worry,

171
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,600
for the work you'll arrange in the future,

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,879
I will finish it well.

173
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,639
I know.

174
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
Actually, it's harder for you than for us.

175
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,480
Your master assigned his best friend

176
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
to work for you.

177
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,559
Do you think you should be strict

178
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,720
with Gu Qiao

179
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
or not?

180
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
What should I do?

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320
It's easy for people to find fault.

182
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,559
You're the only one

183
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,279
who talks too much.

184
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Come on, Qiao.

185
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,000
Hot it. Be careful.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,759
Thank you.

187
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,840
-Here you are. -Thank you.

188
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,279
Thank you.

189
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,639
Thanks to you today.

190
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,559
If it weren't for you,

191
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,279
I still don't know

192
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,200
when the 200 questionnaires will be available,

193
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
How dare you say that?

194
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,879
Your sister is so unkind.

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
I traded my tender face

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,279
for 200 questionnaires,

197
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,799
In the end, I only got this bowl of ramen.

198
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,840
You said you were kind,

199
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,320
okay, okay,

200
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,879
I'll give you all my meat.

201
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,559
Here,

202
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,039
Besides,

203
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,080
when you first played the game,

204
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,279
Aren't you happy?

205
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
I was smiling

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,679
with my little sister,

207
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,519
Here you are.

208
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,240
Sis,

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
Let me ask you a question,

210
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,159
Tell me,

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,759
You and Mr. Yuan

212
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,759
are so different in personality,

213
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,559
How did you two become a close friend?

214
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,000
Something's wrong with you.

215
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,559
Since you joined the company,

216
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,480
you've been asking about

217
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,039
Jiangdong University,

218
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
After knowing Du Bingwen and I

219
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
are classmates,

220
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,879
And you set me up with him crazily.

221
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,120
But after what happened yesterday,

222
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
you didn't say anything

223
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,519
about us.

224
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,159
now

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,679
Instead, he started to care about Mr. Yuan.

226
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,879
Sister Jiang is still old and spicy.

227
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
For your reasoning logic,

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
I'll give you full marks.

229
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,399
What's your relationship with Du Bingwen?

230
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,200
I can't. I can't

231
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,759
tell you yet.

232
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,039
How about this?

233
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,960
Let me guess.

234
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,919
What if it's right?

235
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,600
Just nod your head.

236
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,240
What do you think?

237
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,679
You're quite young, too.

238
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,159
You two

239
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,480
are old friends.

240
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,879
No.

241
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
Relatives.

242
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
You are

243
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,200
cousins.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,039
He's your cousin?

245
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,919
How do you know?

246
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,200
As you said,

247
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,559
this ginger is still old and spicy.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,519
Sis, you really have to keep it a secret for me.

249
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,720
You can't tell anyone in the company,

250
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,399
it depends on your performance.

251
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,240
Well,

252
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,559
How should I behave?

253
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,240
Come on,

254
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
eat more,

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,039
No, no, no.

256
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,200
You eat, you eat, you eat,

257
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,559
I have to behave myself.

258
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,960
Our Shumei products

259
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,039
will be fine.

260
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,399
There must be a misunderstanding.

261
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,080
Misunderstanding?

262
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,960
Misunderstanding what?

263
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,519
You mean,

264
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,440
we want to blackmail you.

265
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,080
Exactly

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Calm down,

267
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Manager Zheng

268
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
has gone to invite the leader.

269
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,200
How about this?

270
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
Come with me to the conference room,

271
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,399
Can you hold on a second?

272
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,519
This way, please.

273
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,919
Master,

274
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,799
a girl said,

275
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,039
I bought a fake at our franchise store

276
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,960
in Zhoushan.

277
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,159
They're making a scene at the front desk.

278
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,840
They came to Shanghai

279
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
from Zhoushan. They live in Shanghai.

280
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,039
Travel to Mt. Zhou.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,240
Have some water,

282
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,679
this is Mr. Yuan,

283
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,960
our vice president of Shumei,

284
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
It's good to have a leader.

285
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,000
See? What should we do

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,879
about this?

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,879
My girlfriend used

288
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,840
your facial mask,

289
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Now your face is like this.

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,279
How can we go to the streets in the future?

291
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,120
How can I go out?

292
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,600
Take a look.

293
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,200
Miss Liu,

294
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
have you been tested

295
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,279
for allergens in the hospital?

296
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,360
I've tested them all.

297
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,240
It proves that

298
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,720
it was caused by your facial mask.

299
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,120
Take a photo.

300
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,279
May I have a look at the mask?

301
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm an old user of Shumei.

302
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,559
This time, my boyfriend and I

303
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,399
ran out of facial masks

304
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,279
when we went to Zhoushan,

305
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,559
So I bought a box from the local area.

306
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,799
I just used one tablet.

307
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,159
That's how I became allergic.

308
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,320
Unscrupulous merchants like you

309
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,879
will do anything to make some money.

310
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,360
today

311
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,080
If we can't give you a satisfactory answer,

312
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
we'll go to the Consumers Association and sue you.

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,639
We'll expose it online. Wait

314
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,320
a minute.

315
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,559
Miss Liu,

316
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,639
I can understand

317
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,519
how you feel right now,

318
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,440
How about this?

319
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,559
I know Shanghai.

320
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,679
A very famous

321
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,440
dermatologist,

322
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,720
I'll make an appointment for your face-to-face consultation

323
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,639
now. Is that okay?

324
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,519
And then?

325
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,559
Since the mask was purchased

326
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,759
through Shumei's regular channels,

327
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,639
Something went wrong.

328
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,879
We must be duty-bound.

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,919
How about this?

330
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,399
Compensate for this,

331
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,919
If you need anything, just ask me

332
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,720
if you can meet it.

333
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,039
We'll try our best to satisfy him.

334
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,720
But Shumei's products

335
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,360
can only be put on the market

336
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,240
after eight quality inspection processes.

337
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,000
Something went wrong.

338
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,960
We were surprised, too.

339
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
So wait for us

340
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
to figure out the reason

341
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,200
behind this.

342
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
That's why I can give you an explanation.

343
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
You'd better keep your word.

344
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
We'll wait for your result.

345
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,440
Let's go.

346
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Actually, I joined the company,

347
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,080
mainly to

348
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,159
help my brother support,

349
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,320
But I didn't know he was like a primary school student

350
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,519
in terms of feelings,

351
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,039
You still play support?

352
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,519
You and your brother are no match for each other.

353
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,159
A primary school student helping a primary school student?

354
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,320
It's even more difficult.

355
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,799
Plus my Ge Ge,

356
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,600
if you have to

357
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
make it obvious,

358
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,360
But it will backfire.

359
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
Then what should we do?

360
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,960
What else can I do?

361
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,559
From now on, you'll listen to me,

362
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,039
so you agreed to let my brother

363
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,240
and Mr. Yuan be together.

364
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Nonsense.

365
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,799
That's great.

366
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,639
From now on, we'll be

367
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,799
good brothers in the trenches.

368
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,519
Good brother,

369
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,279
show your loyalty,

370
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,320
You little brat,

371
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
why are you still touching me?

372
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Gosh,

373
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm excited.

374
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,679
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,480
Are you okay?

376
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,160
It's okay.

377
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,160
Let me get it for you.

378
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,799
Can you tell

379
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,799
which box is fake?

380
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
It's obviously these two.

381
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
Actually, the box in the middle is also fake,

382
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,039
this box is exactly the same as the mask

383
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,839
that Miss Liu

384
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,720
brought just now.

385
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,920
Bingwen,

386
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
where did this come from?

387
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,960
An online shop in Zhoushan.

388
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
More than one million fans,

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
and the sales volume is very impressive.

390
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:01,960
The bartender said

391
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
to get the goods directly from the manufacturer,

392
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,119
The price is one-third of the official price,

393
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,839
the facial mask sent by Miss Liu,

394
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,200
I've sent it to the Quality Inspection Department.

395
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,720
The quality inspection results have come out.

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,880
As it turns out, this knockoff product

397
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,640
not only has excessive microbes,

398
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,880
Everything else is exactly the same

399
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
as our authentic products.

400
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,559
Even we can't tell

401
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,720
if it's true or false.

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,359
Could it be that there's a mistake

403
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
in the quality inspection?

404
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,599
Mr. Fu,

405
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
take a closer look at this package,

406
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,400
Since 2018,

407
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,279
Shumei's packaging

408
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:37,920
has been using

409
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
environmentally-friendly recycled paper

410
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
with exclusive patented technology,

411
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
The packaging of this knockoff product,

412
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,920
though,

413
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
has been very realistic.

414
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,559
But if you look closely,

415
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,039
the texture is still different.

416
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Counterfeit goods like this,

417
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
there's nothing we can do with them.

418
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,839
Ask Yuan Ge,

419
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,160
how much energy and expense

420
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,839
do we put into this every year?

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,319
Cooperating with the law enforcement departments

422
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,119
to crack down on these small workshops

423
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,160
has always been prohibited.

424
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
It doesn't work at all.

425
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,519
Our performance in South China

426
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,160
has declined so badly this time.

427
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,680
It's obvious that someone in Zhoushan

428
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,240
is selling fake goods,

429
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,000
But I'm more worried

430
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,359
about

431
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,160
whether there's something wrong with us?

432
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,000
That's what I thought.

433
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,160
Our factory is in Zhoushan,

434
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,319
so people who sell fake goods should keep a low profile,

435
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,359
It's weird that

436
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,400
they're so high-profile.

437
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,799
This matter can be big or small.

438
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,720
We have to keep

439
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,119
a low profile,

440
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
But you must do it quickly.

441
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,319
Because if word of this

442
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,599
gets out,

443
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,319
Shumei's reputation.

444
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
Will be affected.

445
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,680
It might even affect Li Meng,

446
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,640
who will be online soon.

447
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,279
In fact, it stands to reason

448
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,240
that this matter,

449
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,799
I should ask Liu Min to investigate.

450
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,759
But with her current situation,

451
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,079
if we let her go to Mt. Zhou,

452
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,559
It's not very convenient.

453
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,599
So, Ge Zi,

454
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
I want you to go there.

455
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,799
We must solve the problem

456
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,079
from the root cause.

457
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,160
Got it.

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Bingwen,

459
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,640
go with Gezi.

460
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,000
If there's anything else,

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,720
someone else can discuss it with you.

462
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,079
Mr. Yuan,

463
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,200
hurry up.

464
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,359
Let's go now.

465
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,240
Okay.

466
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,039
Thank you for your hard work.

467
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,599
Leopard,

468
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,440
Mr. Fu,

469
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,079
Help me cancel my trip

470
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,559
to Los Angeles first,

471
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,200
Cancel it.

472
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,720
But Baona has been

473
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,839
waiting for you

474
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,880
to go there. You can wait

475
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,279
until Li Juncheng

476
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,480
goes online.

477
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:13,920
Okay.

478
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,599
You, you two, get out.

479
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's go to Mount Zhou to take care of something.

480
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,759
Be safe at home alone.

481
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,720
Don't worry. Are you leaving now?

482
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,880
Just the two of you.

483
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,160
Why don't you go too?

484
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,759
No, no,

485
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,519
no. Just go.

486
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,279
Don't delay your work.

487
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,079
-Hurry up. -Be careful on

488
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,079
the way. Hurry up.

489
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,119
Be careful.

490
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,839
Goodbye.

491
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,680
That's great.

492
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,079
Yes,

493
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,119
that's great.

494
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,839
Keep a low profile. Go, go, go, go,

495
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,319
go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

496
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,839
You made it.

497
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,079
Keep a low profile.

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,720
Hey,

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,039
Hello, Ge Ge,

500
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,920
are you packing?

501
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,039
Bring more nice clothes,

502
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,599
such as skirts and so on,

503
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,079
I'm going to work,

504
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,440
not travel,

505
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,000
Zhou Shan is famous for its beautiful scenery.

506
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,240
Besides,

507
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,039
You go with Second Brother Du.

508
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,759
What if

509
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,440
there is a spark of love on the road?

510
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,559
Is that

511
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,880
why you called?

512
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm telling you, this is very important.

513
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,200
Alright,

514
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,839
I have more important things to do.

515
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,079
You should work hard.

516
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,720
No,

517
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,000
This kid

518
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,119
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

519
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,480
You must be

520
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,519
in your class.

521
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,440
It has nothing to do with you.

522
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,759
Don't you

523
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,839
have red wine at home?

524
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,279
Take it with you today.

525
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,359
In the evening,

526
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,599
To create an atmosphere.

527
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,880
And then,

528
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,599
can you stop thinking

529
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,680
dirty things like that,

530
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,359
I'm not hanging up.

531
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,079
You brat.

532
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,319
You can teach me.

533
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,359
Hello.

534
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,839
Miss Gu, you're finally here.

535
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,000
How is Ling Ling?

536
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,519
Ling Ling is not feeling well today

537
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,480
and didn't go to school.

538
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,319
She has been clamoring

539
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,640
for Miss Gu at home,

540
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,000
No matter how much I try to persuade him, it's useless.

541
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,799
Mr. Xiong is still on the plane,

542
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,440
so there's nothing I can do.

543
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,799
So I called you.

544
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,920
Go upstairs and have a look.

545
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
She's upstairs now.

546
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,519
Okay.

547
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,519
Ling Ling,

548
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,079
Gu Qiao,

549
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:44,720
Ling Ling,

550
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,440
Ling Ling,

551
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,400
All right, all right.

552
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,720
Stop crying. Be good.

553
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,079
Gu Qiao,

554
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,200
can you take me to my mom?

555
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,359
Okay, okay.

556
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,359
But it's too late today.

557
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,680
I'll take you to your mom some other day.

558
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,279
Okay?

559
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,559
We won't cry.

560
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,279
Let's draw first, okay?

561
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,119
Don't lie to me.

562
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,880
I won't lie to you,

563
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,599
Pinky.

564
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,359
Pull the hook.

565
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,559
Hang yourself by pulling the hook.

566
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,759
Don't change for a hundred years.

567
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,400
All right.

568
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
Dry your tears.

569
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,200
Okay?

570
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,279
Look,

571
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,400
we are the prettiest

572
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,279
little princess again.

573
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,640
Let's draw, okay?

574
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,480
Okay,

575
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,759
Come on.

576
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,680
Ling Ling, did you draw it?

577
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's color it.

578
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,799
Okay?

579
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,079
Okay,

580
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,759
What kind of hair do you think

581
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,480
Dad should have,

582
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,119
Brown

583
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,440
Ling Ling is so good.

584
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,920
Miss Gu,

585
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,400
thank you for coming today.

586
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,960
I found Ling Ling

587
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,240
much happier.

588
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,319
In fact, Ling Ling and I

589
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,480
are quite destined to be together,

590
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,079
I didn't know

591
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,559
how to get along with kids before?

592
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,160
But what about being with Ling Ling?

593
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,440
I became very happy too.

594
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,799
And Ling Ling reminds me of

595
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,799
a friend I had when I was a kid,

596
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
I remember when you were at the airport,

597
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
you seemed to tell me about her,

598
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,240
She's my best friend.

599
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,519
Like Ling Ling,

600
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,079
she didn't like to talk when she was little.

601
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,480
I'm introverted,

602
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,359
and I don't like to talk when I grow up.

603
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,799
But in fact, they are

604
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,960
very sensitive inside.

605
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,119
Although you don't say it,

606
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:29,920
but in your heart,

607
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,039
You know everything.

608
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,440
Mr. Xiong, you're usually busy,

609
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,480
if you don't mind,

610
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,359
Can I come here often

611
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,240
to see if Ling Ling

612
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
says so,

613
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,039
You're willing to

614
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:44,799
tutor Ling Ling now.

615
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,880
Not a tutor.

616
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,480
I will do my best to help her.

617
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,519
If you get along with her like a friend,

618
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,519
it's enough to have you say that.

619
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,960
Thank you,

620
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,759
Miss Gu. You're welcome.

621
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Next time before you come,

622
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
call me in advance.

623
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,279
I'll send someone to pick you up.

624
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,160
No need.

625
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,240
I'll take the bus.

626
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
It's very convenient here.

627
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,400
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

628
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,279
Goodbye.

629
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,079
Goodbye.

630
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,680
Right here.

631
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,400
Hello,

632
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,599
may I help you?

633
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,079
My wife went out to play

634
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,079
and forgot to bring her skin care products,

635
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,440
Do you have any recommendations?

636
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,799
If you buy it for your wife,

637
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,960
of course you want the best one.

638
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,839
You two can consider

639
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,720
this kit,

640
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,839
There are water cream essence

641
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,880
and face cream in it.

642
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,240
I just need to buy one set.

643
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,519
Do you have a mask?

644
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,359
Yes, this way,

645
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,519
please.

646
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:40,960
Take a look.

647
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,000
This facial mask

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,599
is the classic one in our shop.

649
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,920
It ranks first

650
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,039
in the sales list of domestic masks

651
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,960
all the year round,

652
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,400
only 79 yuan a box.

653
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,000
79 is so expensive.

654
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,279
Honey,

655
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,279
let's not buy it here.

656
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,119
I saw an online shop before,

657
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,960
this one,

658
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,799
It's from Zhoushan, too. Look,

659
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,119
their house is exactly the same.

660
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,079
Only 39 yuan?

661
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,000
Exactly the same?

662
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,799
Yes, that's it. It's from Zhoushan. Let's go.

663
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,480
Let's go.

664
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,839
I won't buy it here.

665
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,440
I won't buy it here.

666
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,440
Please wait a moment.

667
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,920
How many boxes do you need?

668
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,000
She uses facial masks as if she were eating them,

669
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
at least 10 boxes,

670
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,119
How about this,

671
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,000
what about the online shop you're looking at?

672
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,359
It's also owned by our company.

673
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,599
I think you want more.

674
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,759
I'll sell it to you

675
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,680
according to the online price.

676
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,839
This shop belongs to your company?

677
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,160
Yes, yes,

678
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
yes. It belongs to Zhoushan,

679
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,559
We met.

680
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,599
Then buy ten boxes here

681
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,279
and take ten boxes.

682
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,119
Okay, I'll go get the goods.

683
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,279
Please wait a moment.

684
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Thank you.

685
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,079
Please enjoy.

686
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,519
Hurry up and eat.

687
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
It's been a long day.

688
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,480
These ten boxes of facial masks,

689
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,599
brought by Miss Liu,

690
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,519
Exactly the same.

691
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,759
As expected, they were selling fake goods in the store,

692
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,839
the big dealer

693
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
in the salesman's mouth,

694
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,920
It must be Manager Niu.

695
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,400
Now we just need to know,

696
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,880
where did he get so many fakes?

697
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,039
I'm even more suspicious now,

698
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,400
that there's something wrong with the factory,

699
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,559
No, I won't.

700
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
I've read the production, purchase

701
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
and shipment records.

702
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,200
It's impossible for so many fakes to come out,

703
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,359
then the problem would be

704
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,720
even more serious

705
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,759
if they didn't come out of the factory.

706
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,160
Then the formula was leaked.

707
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,559
Where are you going?

708
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
I'll go somewhere first.

709
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,400
You eat first,

710
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,519
You're not eating?

711
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,240
When are you coming back?

712
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,920
Mr. Yuan,

713
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,480
Mr. Gong,

714
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,039
Mr. Yuan,

715
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,279
when did you arrive?

716
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,680
Without telling me in advance,

717
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,079
Mr. Gong, please have a seat.

718
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,839
Sit down,

719
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,839
I just came here to do something.

720
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,119
I stopped by to see you.

721
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,519
How is Mr. Gong recently?

722
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,720
Are your legs feeling better?

723
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
It's an old problem.

724
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,480
It doesn't matter.

725
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,160
I've made you and Mr. Fu worry about me.

726
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,440
I'm ashamed,

727
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,640
if it weren't for you and Mr. Fu,

728
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,880
If you bought my factory,

729
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,799
we would have closed down long ago.

730
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,039
Don't say that.

731
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,200
All these years,

732
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,119
if you hadn't done your best

733
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,920
in the rear,

734
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,680
It's impossible

735
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,319
for Shu Mei

736
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,119
to develop so well.

737
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,039
Of course.

738
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,720
Mr. Gong,

739
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,160
I'll do it this time,

740
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
I want you to take a look at something for me,

741
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,680
Well.

742
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,640
Take a look

743
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,640
at the fake ones first,

744
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,680
Although the packaging is different,

745
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,599
its formula is exactly the same as

746
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,519
Shumei Mask.

747
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,640
And this batch of goods

748
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,119
went out from Zhoushan.

749
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,960
Mr. Yuan,

750
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,119
this thing,

751
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,759
It's definitely not from the factory.

752
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,160
If you don't believe me,

753
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,079
you can go to the factory

754
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,400
to check the records.

755
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,160
I really didn't go out from the factory.

756
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,519
Mr. Gong,

757
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,359
I believe in you.

758
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,759
I won't do such a thing

759
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,839
for profit.

760
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes, yes.

761
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,039
Where did the fake goods

762
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:40,640
in Manager Niu's shop

763
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
come from?

764
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,759
Could it be that the formula was leaked?

765
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,200
Mr. Yuan Actually,

766
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,200
Mr. Yuan Mr. Du,

767
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,279
Manager Niu

768
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,240
is here,

769
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,680
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

770
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,160
So that I can arrange it.

771
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,359
What are you going to arrange?

772
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,160
Come on.

773
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,279
Sit down,

774
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,039
sit down, sit down,

775
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,160
Mr. Yuan and I,

776
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,279
this time we came to Zhoushan

777
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,559
to visit Manager Niu.

778
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,519
Look at me,

779
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,000
Mr. Du,

780
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
I'm just a soldier of Shu Mei.

781
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,359
You're

782
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,640
flattering me.

783
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,200
You're being modest.

784
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
You're not a soldier,

785
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,720
you're just a small character,

786
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,599
Can affect

787
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,279
the sales volume of the whole South China region,

788
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,640
Are you a general with a heavy army?

789
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Look,

790
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,200
Mr. Du is well-educated,

791
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,559
In a word,

792
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,200
I've become a general.

793
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,839
I think,

794
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,079
whether it's a young soldier or not,

795
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,319
Or a soldier,

796
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
today,

797
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,039
Don't talk about work,

798
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,320
let's drink,

799
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Come on

800
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,039
What are you waiting for? Pour the wine. Wait

801
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:16,760
a minute.

802
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,239
Don't worry about

803
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,599
drinking. There's one thing,

804
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,920
Manager Niu, help me analyze it.

805
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,000
This time,

806
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
Mr. Yuan and I came to Mount Zhou,

807
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,440
Mr. Yuan was in such a hurry to go out,

808
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,639
he forgot to bring his mask.

809
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,800
We'll go to Binhai Road.

810
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,960
Where's your store?

811
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,559
I bought a few masks.

812
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,400
It's quite cheap.

813
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,159
But how about buying this mask home?

814
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,199
I don't know what's wrong,

815
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,320
but I can't say what's wrong.

816
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,400
I brought it here.

817
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,519
Take a look at it for me.

818
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,679
There's nothing wrong with it.

819
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,400
It's a fake,

820
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,559
and the formula is exactly the same as

821
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,599
Shumei Mask.

822
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,440
Well

823
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,880
How is that possible?

824
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,199
The formula is the same.

825
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,760
It can't be fake.

826
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
So I want to ask Manager Niu,

827
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,719
why are you in South China,

828
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,440
In your shop,

829
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,760
there will be fake products with the same formula

830
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,360
as Shumei facial mask.

831
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,239
I really don't know.

832
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,960
Usually, the manager is in charge of

833
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
the business in this store.

834
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,639
Well,

835
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,159
I'll go back and ask,

836
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,519
No need to ask.

837
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,199
You don't have to act anymore.

838
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,880
This is the shipping record

839
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
of Shumei Factory.

840
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,480
According to the records,

841
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,000
compared to other dealers,

842
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,000
Your shipments have been dropping sharply.

843
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,760
And before I came here,

844
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,039
I asked Mr. Gong,

845
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,079
He said your cousin

846
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,039
is Shumei's core technician,

847
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,599
For self-interest,

848
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,719
I leaked the recipe to you.

849
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,280
And you even threatened Mr. Gong.

850
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,960
Ask him to hide it for you.

851
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,920
I just want to ask you, Manager Niu,

852
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,119
Shumei has been treating you well,

853
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,559
Every time I give you the lowest shipping price,

854
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,079
it's the lowest among the dealers.

855
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,280
But why did you

856
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,599
do such a thing.

857
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,360
Mr. Yuan,

858
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,960
I really don't know what you're talking about.

859
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,159
However,

860
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,679
I also want to say a few words,

861
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,440
Yes

862
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
The price

863
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,559
Shu Mei gave me

864
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,960
is indeed the lowest.

865
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,840
But what's the use?

866
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,000
With such a low price,

867
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,800
you can't sell it,

868
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,760
I have so many brothers,

869
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,800
I don't have enough to eat,

870
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,360
I don't have enough

871
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,760
to eat. My brother is right.

872
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,719
Shut up!

873
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,639
Pour the wine.

874
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,559
This glass of wine,

875
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,719
I'll drink it.

876
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,920
Life is not easy.

877
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,599
We understand each other.

878
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,960
It sounds like

879
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,239
you've admitted it.

880
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,800
Did you sell this fake?

881
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,840
So what if you admit it?

882
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,079
So what if you admit it?

883
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,760
It was sold by my Niu.

884
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,800
Do you have any proof?

885
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,400
Take it out.

886
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,199
Do you have any evidence?

887
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm the one who sold it.

888
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,320
It doesn't matter if there's no evidence.

889
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,239
Manager Niu,

890
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,639
everything you just said,

891
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,239
I've already recorded it.

892
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,119
See you in court

893
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:45,840
You,

894
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,280
-Give it to me. -You.

895
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,119
Let's go.

896
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,000
You jerk.

897
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,599
Du Bingwen,

898
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,559
how are you? Are you okay?

899
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,960
Wake up!

900
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,000
What are you doing?

901
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Didn't you tell me to play it by ear?

902
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,440
You.

903
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,559
Call an ambulance!

904
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
Make a phone call. Make a phone call,

905
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,679
Bing Wen

906
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,039
How is the doctor?

907
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,960
According to the results of the filming,

908
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,760
there is no obvious intracranial injury.

909
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,599
But to be on the safe side,

910
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,079
I suggest,

911
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,440
You should stay in the hospital for observation for a few days.

912
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,960
All right,

913
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,239
Okay,

914
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,719
-Thank you, Doctor. -Thank you, Doctor.

915
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,599
I'm fine.

916
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Yuan Ge,

917
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,639
I like you.

918
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,400
It's so weird.

919
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,519
I don't understand.

920
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,679
You have such

921
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:26,840
a beautiful resume,

922
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,719
Why do you have to come to Shu Mei?

923
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,880
As my subordinate,

924
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,360
I said I would continue

925
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,199
to come back for you.

926
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,119
Do you believe it?

927
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,440
When I become the vice president,

928
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,119
I'll marry you.

929
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,960
Then you'd better wash up and sleep.

930
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,320
It's a Swiss specialty.

931
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,400
It's for you.

932
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,360
How could Second Brother Du

933
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,400
give a watch to someone?

934
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,159
Don't you want to give her a death?

935
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
No.

936
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
There is also a romantic saying.

937
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,599
He gave you all

938
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,960
his time.

939
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,800
Do you know who hit

940
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Second Brother Du's mouth?

941
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,519
I don't care about him.

942
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,039
Zheng Jinnan,

943
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,719
look,

944
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,639
The world is vast

945
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,960
and there are many choices in life,

946
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
It's much more than we thought.

947
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,360
There are some things,

948
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,280
you have to be persistent when you need to be persistent,

949
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,679
But there are some things

950
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,199
that seem precious,

951
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,840
In fact,

952
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,599
it's just a passing sight.

953
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,679
Ling Ling,

954
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,639
let's draw a little here,

955
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,440
Okay?

956
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,920
Okay,

957
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,480
Yeah, that's smart.

958
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,159
I know how to learn it.

959
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
Gu Qiao,

960
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,920
when are you going to have a holiday?

961
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,199
Me,

962
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,000
You won't be like my dad.

963
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,920
You don't want me to see your mom.

964
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,960
Don't you want Ling Ling

965
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,039
to see your mom?

966
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,039
Then I'll discuss it

967
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,239
with my dad,

968
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,519
Let me take you

969
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,679
to see your mom, okay?

970
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,280
Really?

971
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,880
Miss Gu,

972
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
can you come here for a moment?

973
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,320
Then you draw first.

974
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Miss Gu,

975
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,320
in this house,

976
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,480
It's forbidden to raise Ling Ling's mother.

977
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,639
Especially in front of Ling Ling.

978
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,519
Why?

979
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Miss Gu,

980
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,159
don't ask too much about this.

981
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,880
Mr. Xiong won't tell me.

982
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,679
Ling Ling,

983
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Dad,

984
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,760
Be good,

985
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,480
Did you miss Dad today?

986
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,639
Yes,

987
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,639
Okay,

988
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:14,960
Miss Gu,

989
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,360
We meet again so soon.

990
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,199
What do you think?

991
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,119
How is Ling Ling doing today?

992
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,519
Ling Ling is very good.

993
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:21,880
Ling Ling,

994
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,920
Please show me

995
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,199
the painting you just drew.

996
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Okay.

997
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,280
Dad, look!

998
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:32,559
That's great.

999
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,639
Lingling is so powerful.

1000
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,360
To thank Gu Qiao,

1001
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,800
we asked Gu Qiao

1002
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,760
to stay and have dinner with us.

1003
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,440
Okay?

1004
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,480
Sure, sure,

1005
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,679
Ling Ling

1006
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,000
Sister, do you have anything else to do tonight?

1007
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,679
Let's eat some other time, okay?

1008
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,079
All right,

1009
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,079
all right,

1010
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,400
Mr. Xiong,

1011
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,280
I have something to tell you.

1012
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,800
Okay.

1013
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,280
Ling Ling just told me that her mother,

1014
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,239
Miss Gu,

1015
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,599
I'll talk to you

1016
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,320
when I have a chance.

1017
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,760
Go on.

1018
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,920
I'll get back to work.

1019
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,519
Ling Ling,

1020
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,519
be good and draw, okay?
