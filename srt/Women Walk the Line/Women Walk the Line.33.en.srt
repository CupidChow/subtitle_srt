1
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,800
You're awake.

2
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,039
Why am I sleeping here?

3
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,400
When I saw you sleeping by the bed last night,

4
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
I felt very uncomfortable.

5
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,639
So I carried you to the sofa.

6
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
What time is it now?

7
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,280
It's eight o'clock,

8
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
eight o'clock,

9
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
I have a meeting to attend.

10
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm going to be late.

11
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm leaving now.

12
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,719
Let me see you off.

13
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,159
Just

14
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,919
lie here and have a good rest.

15
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,840
I'll ask the doctor

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
to check on you later.

17
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,800
I'll come to accompany you tonight.

18
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,039
Bag.

19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
Have a good rest.

20
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,120
Goodbye. Goodbye.

21
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,159
Goodbye.

22
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,080
Mr. Xiong, Fu Mei can change her mind this time,

23
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,479
I really want to thank you.

24
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,039
I will implement the contract with Guangke as soon as possible.

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,639
Wish us a happy cooperation.

26
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
Miss Gu, long time no see. You're here

27
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,279
to see Yuan Ge again.

28
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
Didn't I get sick

29
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,199
some time ago?

30
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,040
You caused Yuan Ge a lot of trouble.

31
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,040
So my mom

32
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,319
made some dishes herself,

33
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,120
She asked me to give it to her to express my gratitude.

34
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,279
Auntie really won't give up

35
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,639
until she reaches the Yellow River,

36
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,120
No, it should be you.

37
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
What do you mean?

38
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,959
Why can't I understand?

39
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,759
Don't pretend to be confused.

40
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,839
If you don't want me

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to tear you apart in public,

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
Come to the rooftop with me.

43
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,480
If you're a man,

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
don't use your mother as a cover.

45
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,639
You love acting so much?

46
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,879
I used to think you were

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
a good man who wanted nothing, didn't I?

48
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,519
Miss Gu, what are you talking about?

49
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
You're still acting, right?

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,399
Now that Yuan Ge

51
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,560
and Du Bingwen have broken up,

52
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
Are you happy now?

53
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,319
You kidnapped Yuan Ge with depression

54
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,199
just to break them up, right?

55
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,639
Are you happy now?

56
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,759
Did they really break up?

57
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,399
I'm telling you,

58
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,199
even if they break up,

59
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,240
It's not your turn.

60
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,879
I hate

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,560
scumbags

62
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,639
like you the most,

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,240
If you

64
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,199
really like Yuan Ge,

65
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,399
So we can compete fairly

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
with Du Bingwen,

67
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,519
You're pretending to be pitiful.

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,560
Who are you showing it to?

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes.

70
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Don't you want to kill yourself?

71
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,439
Come on.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
What?

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I dare not.

74
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
Or do you want to act in front of me?

75
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,600
It can't achieve the effect you want.

76
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
Miss Gu,

77
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,920
I really think of Yuan Ge as my friend,

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,720
I really want to care about her.

79
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,079
If you misunderstand

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
what I did,

81
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay, I apologize to you.

82
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,839
I'm sorry,

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm telling you,

84
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,959
Stay away from Yuan Ge

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,399
from now on. Yuan Ge is kind,

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm different from her.

87
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,560
There must be something wrong with Sun Bin.

88
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,759
Yes.

89
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,079
When he took care of uncle,

90
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,439
do you think he's a good person?

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,680
But I'm telling you,

92
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,360
he's just

93
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,720
a wolf in sheep's clothing,

94
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,319
He approached you for a purpose.

95
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,360
He wants to break you up with Du Bingwen,

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,639
and then take advantage of it.

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,399
I just came to remind you.

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
Think about it.

99
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Is there a possibility?

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,000
you guys

101
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,759
It's not suitable at all.

102
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,800
Then tell me,

103
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,040
why did he pretend to be sick?

104
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Because I like you,

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,920
pretending to be sick and pestering you,

106
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,920
You can't tell.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,439
I have depression,

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
can you keep it a secret for me?

109
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
Did you just say that

110
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,160
the bottle

111
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,160
was filled with vitamins,

112
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,560
It's not for depression.

113
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,040
Sun Bin's mother disliked his girlfriend,

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,920
so she messed up the two of them.

115
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
Sun Bin ran away from home

116
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,879
in a fit of pique.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,319
What did I think it was?

118
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,480
Isn't it just a breakup?

119
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,959
You look like a high school student.

120
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,439
I also have

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,839
a girlfriend of three years,

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
But about this,

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
I never mentioned it to my mom,

124
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,360
If my mom knew about her,

125
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,440
she would force me to get married

126
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
and have a baby right away.

127
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,120
Your son has a girlfriend,

128
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,000
and Ge Ge has a boyfriend.

129
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,039
If the in-laws call,

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,240
it's easy for people to misunderstand.

131
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,000
My son has a girlfriend.

132
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,519
How do you know that?

133
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,000
If you ask me,

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,159
he's not sick at all.

135
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,039
That's why he's afraid to see a doctor.

136
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,960
Are you free?

137
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,879
Can you come out?

138
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,799
He wants to break you up with Du Bingwen,

139
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,639
and then take advantage of it.

140
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,840
Where is Du Bingwen?

141
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,759
He's so childish.

142
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,960
Why did he go abroad

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,639
in a fit of pique?

144
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,600
By doing so,

145
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
he doesn't care about

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,879
your feelings, does he?

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,320
What do you mean by forcing him?

148
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,080
No, he's lying there.

149
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,399
He's right, okay?

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,919
Hello, Aunt Sun,

151
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,799
this is Yuan Ge.

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,039
Yuan Ge,

153
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
about last time,

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,879
I haven't

155
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,840
thanked you yet.

156
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,440
Auntie,

157
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,080
come with me,

158
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,559
You don't have to be so polite.

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
What did the doctor say

160
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,919
he took?

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,639
What drug? He overdosed,

162
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,639
and then he was admitted to the hospital.

163
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,399
I asked him,

164
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,799
what's going on?

165
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,039
He didn't say anything even if he was killed.

166
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,600
And you don't want me to ask you,

167
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,600
but you said aunt is bored,

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,399
So,

169
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,799
it turns out,

170
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,879
It turns out that Sun Bin is not like this.

171
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,320
The child is quite good,

172
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,200
Good and dutiful,

173
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,759
and now all of a sudden,

174
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,440
As if she were a different person,

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,399
after she came out of the hospital,

176
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,639
That's even more true.

177
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,320
If you don't move,

178
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,840
we'll argue. Why are you

179
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,240
looking for me today?

180
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,799
Auntie,

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,480
here's the thing,

182
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
Sun Bin broke up

183
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,600
with his girlfriend,

184
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,679
Do you understand?

185
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,080
Where did Sun Bin get a girlfriend?

186
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,159
Why are you breaking up?

187
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
But Sun Bin told me,

188
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
he has a girlfriend

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,039
who has been dating for many years,

190
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,320
Because you were not satisfied

191
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
when you brought it home last time?

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,279
We had a big fight.

193
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,559
Then we broke up.

194
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,240
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

195
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
Let me tell you,

196
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,440
where did he get a girlfriend?

197
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,559
When I was in college,

198
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,919
when it was time to have a girlfriend.

199
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,679
No

200
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,320
With all my heart

201
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
on this study,

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,879
Oh, no. Even after

203
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,559
I get a job,

204
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,159
And then he threw himself on his career.

205
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,240
Where does he get a girlfriend?

206
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
If he wants to find a girlfriend,

207
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,279
I will

208
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,240
worry about him

209
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,559
in such a hurry.

210
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,159
Then.

211
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,879
Sun Bin once

212
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,799
ran away from home,

213
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,679
You even called me

214
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,519
and asked me to find him.

215
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,159
Do you still remember?

216
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,960
I remember,

217
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,799
it wasn't the last time.

218
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,240
No, no. I got it wrong.

219
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,879
Last time it was because of

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,519
something at work,

221
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,519
I got promoted.

222
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,480
I lost my job.

223
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,759
And then I talked a little bit,

224
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,600
"Good guy,

225
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,279
He started to lose his temper with me

226
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,440
and ran away like this.

227
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
He didn't answer the phone.

228
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
That time,

229
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,120
thanks to you.

230
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,480
Aunt,

231
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,200
do you remember it wrong?

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Of course not.

233
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,600
Auntie doesn't have

234
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
Alzheimer's disease yet?

235
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,840
Yuan Ge,

236
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,879
I'm so sorry. It's too crowded.

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,039
Sun Bin,

238
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
do you have something to say to me?

239
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,279
There's a passage

240
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,799
that I've been holding in my heart for a long time.

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
I have to tell you today,

242
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Tell me,

243
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,519
Look,

244
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,039
we've known each other for so long,

245
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
We've been through so much together,

246
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,799
just like your dad and mom were hospitalized,

247
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,799
And then,

248
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,039
about me,

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,000
This brought to my attention

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,399
the fact that I have to cherish

251
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,759
the people and things around me,

252
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,679
Yuan Ge, I want to tell you,

253
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,679
I like you.

254
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,240
Can you give me a chance?

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,840
You cured me.

256
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
You gave me the courage to live.

257
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,200
I want to be with you.

258
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
I'll take good care of you.

259
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
To spend the most difficult time

260
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,279
with you,

261
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,759
Okay?

262
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
I just went to see Aunt Sun,

263
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,159
why did my mom bother you again?

264
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
What did she say to you?

265
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,279
Don't take

266
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,440
what she said to heart.

267
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,759
She told me that

268
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,679
you don't have a girlfriend at all.

269
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes

270
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,559
About my girlfriend,

271
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,559
no,

272
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
I've never been officially

273
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,679
in a relationship.

274
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,840
Why did you lie to me?

275
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,000
Because I like you.

276
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,600
From the first time

277
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,679
I met you,

278
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,200
Then I fell in love with you.

279
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,840
But by that time,

280
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,559
Du Bingwen was already with you,

281
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,840
What do you want me to do?

282
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,440
I know your character,

283
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
so I can only stay by your side

284
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,720
in this way.

285
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,919
So you pretended to be depressed?

286
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,080
You played suicide in front of me,

287
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,279
and framed Du Bingwen.

288
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,840
Sun Bin,

289
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
I really didn't expect,

290
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,240
You're the kind of person,

291
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,080
No.

292
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,159
Yuan Ge, can't you tell?

293
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,840
I did all this

294
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,039
because I like you.

295
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,919
I did all this

296
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,840
for you, didn't I?

297
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,519
Du Bingwen is not good enough for you.

298
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,320
He's so childish.

299
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,480
I can only coax you with sweet words.

300
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
He doesn't even want to marry you.

301
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,919
Can't you tell?

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,879
I can't watch

303
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,720
you jump into this fire pit.

304
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,440
That's enough.

305
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,279
Do you know that?

306
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,000
I really treat you as my friend.

307
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,080
You told me,

308
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,320
when you were depressed,

309
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,559
I'm really worried about you.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
I spent so much time

311
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,720
trying to enlighten you.

312
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,519
It's because I think,

313
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,840
God is unfair.

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,559
You are such a good person,

315
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,360
you have so many advantages,

316
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,639
You're loyal, honest, kind,

317
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,720
and self-motivated,

318
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
At that time, I was thinking,

319
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
why are you such a nice person,

320
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,679
It will end like this.

321
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,480
Now I understand.

322
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,679
People like you deserve it.

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,960
You deserve it,

324
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,879
Yuan Ge,

325
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,399
How can you be

326
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,360
like everyone else?

327
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,399
You've never thought

328
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
highly of me.

329
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,320
You're the only one who looks down on you.

330
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,919
Yes

331
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,360
People as noble as you,

332
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,080
how can you think highly of me?

333
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,159
How could you get to know me?

334
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,799
Who am I?

335
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
Sun Bin,

336
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,360
one born in the mud,

337
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
People who grow in the dust,

338
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
for the rest of my life,

339
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,919
I just did two words,

340
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,600
work hard.

341
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,799
You know what?

342
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,639
When you work hard,

343
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,320
you can no longer support it.

344
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
When I was in my life,

345
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,960
don't talk about

346
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,440
fair and square with me.

347
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,799
Let me ask you,

348
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,519
if I don't use some tricks,

349
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,759
Will you notice me?

350
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,720
If I didn't have that kind of means,

351
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,399
would you be standing here

352
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,480
with me today?

353
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,599
If you think your efforts

354
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,799
are using improper means,

355
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,599
To get something that doesn't belong to you.

356
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Then you'll always

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,799
be looked down upon,

358
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,960
Sun Bin,

359
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,599
you're the one who made me realize

360
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,519
what a poor person is today?

361
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,680
There must be something to hate.

362
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,279
I was wrong.

363
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,880
Ge Zi.

364
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,240
Mr. Fu,

365
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,519
I want to take a leave,

366
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,400
Have a seat.

367
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,160
If you're in a bad mood,

368
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,240
you should take a good break

369
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,920
from the company.

370
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,559
Don't worry.

371
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,640
Actually,

372
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,680
I want to go to the United States to find Bingwen.

373
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,839
-Go to America. -Mei, you're

374
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,759
right.

375
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
Bingwen did a lot

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
for me,

377
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't want to lose him.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
So this time,

379
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,960
I want to go to the United States and take the initiative to save him.

380
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,680
Gezi,

381
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,359
actually this time

382
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,000
I asked Bingwen to go to the United States,

383
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,960
I asked him to help me inspect

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,279
the channel that Baolai

385
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,680
gave us.

386
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,559
Mr. Fu,

387
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,480
you said before,

388
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,599
If you have foreign capital,

389
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,519
you want to buy your friend's company,

390
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,640
Actually, Borai

391
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,839
wants to buy Shu Mei,

392
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,960
Am I right?

393
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,400
Yes.

394
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,480
But this time, I asked Bingwen to go,

395
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
because after I found out,

396
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,440
I'll tell you later.

397
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,759
Mr. Fu,

398
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,400
why?

399
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,359
This one,

400
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,920
this is the period of time,

401
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,559
According to the sales data of Li Meng and Shumei,

402
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
take a look at it yourself.

403
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,799
In fact, recently,

404
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,440
I've been thinking about a question,

405
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,279
In fact, in life,

406
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,119
we are constantly

407
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,160
making choices,

408
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,480
As long as we choose

409
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,519
something,

410
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,119
We have to give up.

411
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,799
Other things,

412
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,319
after all, one's energy

413
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,599
is limited.

414
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,359
Am I right?

415
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,079
This time, Borai Group

416
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,039
is using it to help Li Meng

417
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,440
explore overseas markets

418
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,200
as a condition of acquisition,

419
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,680
And as you know,

420
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,240
over the years,

421
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,559
In fact,

422
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,640
there are more and more cheap brands

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,359
like Shumei,

424
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Even though

425
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,359
our overall sales volume

426
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,160
seems to be on the rise.

427
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
But in fact, this increase

428
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,599
is gradually declining.

429
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,640
So I decided

430
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,720
to sell Shu Mei,

431
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Then, with this new fund,

432
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,079
we can continue to invest.

433
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
Be a great Li man with all your heart.

434
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,839
Mr. Fu.

435
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,400
We've done so much

436
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,599
for Shumei,

437
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,559
Do you really have the heart to see Shumei

438
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,200
disappear like this?

439
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,319
This is my decision

440
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,000
after careful consideration.

441
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,079
Mr. Fu,

442
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,200
if you really insist,

443
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,400
I have no choice.

444
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,160
But emotionally,

445
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,480
I really can't accept it.

446
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Giving our hard work to others,

447
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,599
Li Juncheng is on the rise now,

448
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,880
But Shumei

449
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,279
also has a reputation for many years.

450
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,279
Although the sales volume is not as good as Li Meng's,

451
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
its market

452
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,680
is still stable.

453
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,400
If you're worried

454
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,160
about sales,

455
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,799
Then leave this question to me.

456
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,000
Give me one month.

457
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,319
Just one month.

458
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,240
I must think of a way to break the trap.

459
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,319
Ge Zi,

460
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,839
you know that.

461
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,920
In this situation,

462
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,839
we're not just doing

463
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,960
a promotion once or twice,

464
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,119
You can handle it.

465
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,799
I know.

466
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,519
I will solve the problem

467
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,519
from the root cause.

468
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
If Baolai Group

469
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,759
really wants to buy it,

470
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:31,200
He won't care about this month.

471
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:33,960
Mr. Fu,

472
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,599
if one month later,

473
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,119
I didn't think of a way to break it.

474
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,119
It won't be too late for you to sell it again.

475
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,079
Mr. Fu,

476
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,200
please give me one more chance.

477
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,720
Take it

478
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,160
as giving Shumei another chance.

479
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,799
Okay?

480
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,519
You really won't give up until you reach the Yellow River.

481
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,599
Okay,

482
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,519
I'll wait for you for another month.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,839
Gu Qiao,

484
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,160
I want you to do me a favor.

485
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,759
What are you talking about?

486
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,599
We can't let anyone else

487
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,359
know about this.

488
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
Mr. Fu is going to sell Shu Mei,

489
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,000
I have to do it within a month,

490
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,759
Let Shumei double her sales,

491
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,240
otherwise I have no reason

492
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,559
to persuade her to persist.

493
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,599
I'm afraid if this matter gets out,

494
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,400
the company will be in a panic.

495
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,119
So only you can help me.

496
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,440
How do you want me to help you?

497
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,720
Find a way to break the game,

498
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,799
and let Shumei learn from cheap skin care products,

499
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,519
Upgrade

500
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,839
to become an irreplaceable brand

501
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,920
of skin care products.

502
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
But it's hard.

503
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,440
Have you figured out what to do?

504
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,519
Actually, I studied

505
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,400
the market data of Shu Mei

506
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,480
in the past two years,

507
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,079
Even if Li Meng doesn't take up the resources,

508
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,160
Shu Mei's market share,

509
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,440
And it's been declining.

510
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
In fact, Shumei's comprehensive conditions are good,

511
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,880
but when it comes to new product development,

512
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
It has been relatively slow.

513
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,119
It's my fault.

514
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,160
I've been striving for stability in the market,

515
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,160
paying more attention to quality and reputation.

516
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,720
What's wrong with focusing on these?

517
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,279
It's not wrong.

518
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,759
But now,

519
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,880
there are many

520
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
cheap skin care brands on the market,

521
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,519
Once we slow down,

522
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,160
someone else will replace us.

523
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,279
The particularity of skin care products

524
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,680
also doomed users

525
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,039
to be unable to distinguish

526
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,599
who is good and who is bad in a short time.

527
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,480
I see.

528
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,599
Shumei is only old,

529
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,319
but she doesn't have

530
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,839
irreplaceable speciality.

531
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,680
And even though Li Meng

532
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,200
has just been listed,

533
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,119
But there are not many products

534
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,680
with the same price on the market,

535
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,359
So it can come from behind.

536
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,279
That's the truth.

537
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,160
So the most important thing for us now,

538
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
is to find Shumei

539
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,799
irreplaceable.

540
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,279
But it's too hard.

541
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,799
It's okay.

542
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Let's figure it out together.

543
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,640
Mr. Fu,

544
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,160
if Mr. Yuan really finds a way

545
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,240
to break the trap in a month.

546
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,359
Do you really want to give up

547
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,680
such a good chance?

548
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,960
In fact, Ge Zi is right.

549
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,720
Shumei,

550
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,839
after all,

551
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,200
we've worked so hard for so many years,

552
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,240
If there's a better way,

553
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,440
I don't want to sell it.

554
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,640
Since Ge Zi

555
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,039
is willing to give it a shot,

556
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,759
Why don't you give it a try?

557
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,000
Even if it's for Gezi,

558
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,319
or for the old me,

559
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,359
One last chance.

560
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,200
Dad,

561
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,599
why isn't Gu Qiao here yet?

562
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,920
Ling Ling is hungry. Eat first.

563
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm not hungry.

564
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,920
I want to wait for Gu Qiao to eat with me.

565
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,160
Sir,

566
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,880
let Ling Ling eat first.

567
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,839
The child is hungry.

568
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,880
Okay,

569
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
You can eat first.

570
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,599
Ling Ling, eat it first.

571
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,240
Ling Ling, eat it.

572
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,799
Come and eat.

573
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,799
Ge Ge, are you hungry?

574
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,839
Let's order takeout.

575
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:14,799
Okay.

576
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
See if there's anything good to eat?

577
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,079
Why didn't you reply to the message?

578
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Are you okay?

579
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,559
Sorry,

580
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,319
I've been working,

581
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,079
I didn't check my phone.

582
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,400
What's wrong?

583
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,559
It's okay. I just want to see

584
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,880
which one has a higher score?

585
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,200
It's too late.

586
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
Don't order it.

587
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,480
Come back to my house tonight.

588
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,599
I'll cook for you.

589
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,720
Let me cook it for you.

590
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,240
All right.

591
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,079
In this case,

592
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,079
we can work overtime together,

593
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,400
Okay,

594
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,440
Let's go.

595
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,240
Okay.

596
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,880
Gu Qiao,

597
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,440
how about this?

598
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,720
You'd better move back in.

599
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,839
so that we can

600
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,160
commute to work like we used to,

601
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,119
You don't have to be too tired.

602
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,440
But I think it's good.

603
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,559
Distance makes beauty.

604
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,279
Let's go.

605
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,279
Hey,

606
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,160
my sister-in-law has executed Sun Bin.

607
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,680
You should come back soon.

608
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,599
What is she doing these days?

609
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,240
I don't know.

610
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
It feels like she and Gu Qiao

611
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,359
have disappeared for days.

612
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,880
I sent a message to Gu Qiao,

613
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,799
but she didn't reply to me.

614
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,640
You should come back soon.

615
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,599
Otherwise, I have no reason

616
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,519
to look for Gu Qiao?

617
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm so busy with work

618
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
that I can't go back,

619
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:49,799
Not you,

620
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,079
Hey,

621
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,079
Hello.

622
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,359
The company has been working overtime yesterday,

623
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,440
and something happened.

624
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,599
So I didn't check my phone.

625
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm sorry,

626
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,960
did something happen to the company?

627
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
Is there anything we can do for you?

628
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:10,920
It's okay.

629
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,240
Yuan Ge and I can handle it.

630
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,119
I guess he'll be busy for a while.

631
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,039
I can't come

632
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,839
to see you often.

633
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,359
Gu Qiao,

634
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
I know you really want to prove that

635
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,920
you are an independent girl.

636
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,039
But you don't have to work so hard.

637
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,319
If you have me,

638
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,359
I can take good care of you and Ling Ling,

639
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
I know.

640
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,160
But this job

641
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,400
has enriched me.

642
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,200
And I have a sense of accomplishment.

643
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,640
Most importantly,

644
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,200
I can regain my confidence.

645
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,599
Sister,

646
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,960
come and see if my drawing is good.

647
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:43,839
I'm here.

648
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,400
If you draw the sun,

649
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,759
you're drawing the moon, okay?

650
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,079
Okay.

651
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,440
Guoman is easy to get famous out of the circle,

652
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,920
but the copyright of the popular Guoman

653
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,280
is so expensive.

654
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,480
Mr. Yuan,

655
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,119
the picturesque Mr. Wang is here.

656
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:22,840
Hello,

657
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Mr. Yuan.

658
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Mr. Wang.

659
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,239
Have a seat.

660
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,239
Hello, long time no see.

661
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,360
You're so pretty.

662
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,440
Qiao is here too.

663
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,960
You two,

664
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
this is getting more and more beautiful.

665
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,159
Mr. Wang, what brings you here?

666
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
Something really happened.

667
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,400
Let me get straight to the point.

668
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,280
I won't waste your time.

669
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,639
Here's the thing.

670
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,599
Bai Xue,

671
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,800
her copyright,

672
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
I've been in your company for so long,

673
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
and I'm still here,

674
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,360
I was wondering,

675
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,599
can you give us back

676
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,760
the copyright?

677
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:06,840
Here's the thing.

678
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
I'll take the deposit

679
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,880
you paid me,

680
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,559
Didn't you tell me

681
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,320
before you returned it?

682
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,880
Look at your company,

683
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,599
you also want to terminate the contract with her.

684
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,519
Am I right?

685
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
The copyright has been released for so long,

686
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,079
but it still doesn't move,

687
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,320
You might as well give it back to me.

688
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,599
Okay?

689
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,639
Mr. Wang,

690
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
about this matter,

691
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,159
We need to reconsider.

692
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,559
I'll contact you later.

693
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,360
Okay, I know that.

694
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,280
I won't bother you then.

695
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
-I'll wait for your news. -Okay.

696
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,280
Goodbye, ladies.

697
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,440
Goodbye.

698
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,440
Mr. Wang,

699
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,679
you really know how to do business.

700
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,639
When the copyright wasn't popular,

701
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,000
he wouldn't give it back even if he died.

702
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,079
The copyright is valuable,

703
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,599
but he wants to terminate the contract with us instead.

704
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,639
You don't even know,

705
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,519
Bai Xue,

706
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,320
after this storm,

707
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,719
The copyright has been multiplied several times.

708
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
Not only Bai Xue,

709
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,320
but also film and television companies,

710
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,199
Advertising companies,

711
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,239
even the catering industry,

712
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,079
They all saw Guoman's bonus.

713
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
So the copyright of Guoman

714
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,440
is also rising.

715
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,159
About what happened to Bai Xue last time,

716
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,719
how is the follow-up going?

717
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,920
I've been following

718
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,400
the online news about plagiarism,

719
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
It's already very few.

720
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,280
The main thing is that Jia Long

721
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,679
hasn't put a solid hammer,

722
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,800
Everyone thinks that

723
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,199
he is making his own hype,

724
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,159
This country is picturesque,

725
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,440
seeing this situation,

726
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,599
He also spent a lot of money.

727
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,960
Wash the white snow.

728
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,039
Because of this,

729
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,840
a lot of people turned to Snow White Black.

730
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
Since

731
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,079
we don't have

732
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,159
other copyrights available now.

733
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,719
We might as well use Bai Xue's cartoon.

734
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,239
It's settled so soon.

735
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,719
Maybe I was

736
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,840
too conservative before.

737
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,320
In fact, Bingwen is right,

738
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,880
if there is no momentum,

739
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,719
It's hard to do a good job in the market.

740
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,880
Ge Ge,

741
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,159
tell me,

742
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,800
How about

743
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,920
combining this product

744
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,199
with culture?

745
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,880
I think it's good.

746
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,280
It's a good plan.

747
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,039
How about this?

748
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,599
Tomorrow,

749
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,599
Report to Mr. Fu

750
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,719
with me.

751
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,400
Me?

752
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,800
No, you should go alone.

753
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,239
No way.

754
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,239
You came up with

755
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,519
a lot of ideas.

756
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,119
You have to go with me.

757
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,719
Alright,

758
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,199
Then.

759
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,480
Let's work hard together.

760
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:56,760
Gu Qiao,

761
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,719
thank you.

762
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,920
You're too polite to me.

763
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:20,639
Mr. Fu,

764
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,920
what do you think?

765
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,719
Breaking through the ecological chain,

766
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,239
combining cosmetics with culture,

767
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,639
In the future, Shu Mei

768
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,239
will not only sell cosmetics,

769
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,519
We will also launch a variety of

770
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,360
cultural products,

771
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,159
Yes,

772
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,639
we can also work with

773
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,079
China's intangible cultural heritage,

774
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,960
Let Shumei

775
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,280
be the best spokesperson

776
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,199
for our national brand,

777
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
Even if there are 100 more

778
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,840
cheap cosmetics,

779
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
There's no way

780
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,320
to replace Shumei.

781
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,159
This plan is really bold,

782
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,840
actually speaking of it,

783
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,880
I was influenced by Bingwen.

784
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
He always told me that

785
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,440
I was too conservative.

786
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,320
You need to break through the market,

787
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,159
and do things that no one else has ever done.

788
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
In fact, like this closed-loop ecological chain,

789
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,960
many home products,

790
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,559
Electronic products. They're

791
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,239
all working on it.

792
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,559
And there have been many

793
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,599
successful cases.

794
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,239
Then why can't we

795
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,079
use cosmetics?

796
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,639
I think this is a good

797
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,480
starting point.

798
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,639
However,

799
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,039
everything has yet to be verified

800
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,239
by the market,

801
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,679
So without increasing

802
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,480
the financial burden of the company,

803
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,320
We decided

804
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,760
to use Bai Xue's cartoon

805
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,679
as a lever first,

806
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,360
Let's hold a grand press conference.

807
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,039
We can use

808
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,159
all the resources we want.

809
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,000
One press conference

810
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:43,760
can achieve

811
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,079
the effect you just said,

812
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,960
It depends on how it works.

813
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:48,800
Mr. Fu,

814
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,440
we have confidence.

815
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,199
I'll wait and see.

816
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,360
When the two of you were caught

817
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,599
in the storm of public opinion,

818
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,480
Shu Mei didn't throw stones down a well,

819
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,440
this time,

820
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,920
We came here with full sincerity

821
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,159
to cooperate with you two,

822
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,239
believe

823
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,480
You won't refuse, will you?

824
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,559
Of course,

825
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,719
I'm very happy

826
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,039
to continue the unfinished contract

827
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,159
between our two companies,

828
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,000
Wish us a happy cooperation.

829
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,920
-Here. -Happy working with you.

830
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,000
Wait,

831
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,199
Cooperation is fine,

832
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,719
but the price needs to be renegotiated.

833
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
You want to raise the price?

834
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,679
I heard that when Jia Long

835
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,199
made a scene on the internet,

836
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,239
Your company offered to terminate the contract

837
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,199
in the first place.

838
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,159
As the water recedes, the rocks appear.

839
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,559
You want to work together again,

840
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:51,960
Mr. Wang,

841
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,000
My current offer

842
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,360
is different from the original one.

843
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,199
Well,

844
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,199
what's Mr. Bai's current price?

845
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,719
It has quadrupled compared with the past.

846
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,840
But the contract between the two companies is in front of us,

847
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,679
so the price,

848
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,079
We should follow the previous example,

849
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,639
if Miss Bai hadn't been caught

850
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,079
in the storm of public opinion,

851
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,559
We wouldn't have been forced

852
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,960
to cancel the marketing campaign.

853
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Speaking of which,

854
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:15,800
Mr. Wang,

855
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
We haven't calculated

856
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,079
the compensation fee with you yet?

857
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,159
Besides,

858
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,760
it depends on the situation at that time.

859
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,320
Shumei can terminate

860
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,840
the contract unilaterally

861
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,480
and the valuable company has not refunded

862
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,840
any related money,

863
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,719
Compensation and liquidated damages.

864
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,760
Late payment fee,

865
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,559
plus interest,

866
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,920
After calculation,

867
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,679
it should be a lot of money.

868
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,320
Yes.

869
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,320
Of course,

870
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,320
if you two

871
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,639
still feel reluctant,

872
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
Then let's go through the legal process.

873
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,559
Solve the problems left over from history.

874
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,559
Don't talk about

875
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,639
anything else.

876
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,679
No, no, no.

877
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,639
Miss Gu,

878
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,039
I'll do as you say.

879
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,719
I asked Mr. Bai

880
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,079
to fully cooperate with your activities,

881
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,440
Full cooperation.

882
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,320
That depends on

883
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,559
whether Mr. Bai is willing to do it or not?

884
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,079
No, no,

885
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,559
this company is mine,

886
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,679
It's up to me.

887
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,840
It's up to me.

888
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:10,920
Have a seat,

889
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:13,639
Come on,
