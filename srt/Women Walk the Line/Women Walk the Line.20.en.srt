1
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,480
For the sake of a list,

2
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
how could you do this to yourself?

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,799
Yes,

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,079
but it's understandable,

5
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,920
You said the business ability is not good,

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
but you still don't allow it.

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,079
Try harder in private.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
I heard Gu Qiao,

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
I sat on his lap

10
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,319
last night.

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,920
You even drank cross-cupped wine

12
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,200
with someone? Really?

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,599
Disgusting.

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,239
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,879
Nothing.

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,359
The whole company knows,

17
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,799
in order to cooperate with Snow White Company,

18
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,359
I drank and sang

19
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,879
with his boss last night,

20
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,920
You're still sitting on his lap.

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,759
Stop it.

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,319
How dare she

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,199
do it?

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,879
Why can't I tell you?

25
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,680
It's not that simple.

26
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
You said that, didn't you?

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,599
What did you do on your own?

28
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
I don't know.

29
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,840
Could it be that Mr. Wang is cooperating with you?

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,199
Is it because of your professional ability?

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
How is your professional ability?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,159
Who doesn't in the office?

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,439
Here, here, here,

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,599
Well.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
If you hit me,

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
you'll be the one who hit me.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Mr. Fu.

38
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
You're Yuan Ge's best friend,

39
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,840
and she's dedicated to helping you.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
I brought you

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
out of the mire in your hometown.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,639
Now that you're in Shumei,

43
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,039
shouldn't you

44
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,680
reciprocate your kindness?

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Yuan Ge's dad

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,120
is still sick?

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,479
Shouldn't you

48
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,759
share it with her?

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
This is your junior.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,439
She's Ge Zi's disciple.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,120
How could you hit her?

52
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,400
Mr. Fu, because of her,

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
you don't have to explain.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,199
Beat people,

55
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,080
no matter what reason you have,

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,719
It's all my fault.

57
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,120
You don't have to be happy.

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,639
Jeong Yeon Hee,

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
you're

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
an old employee of Shumei.

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,599
What do I hate the most?

62
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,360
Don't you know?

63
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,879
Office infighting,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
I'm sorry you still remember.

65
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,680
I was hoping

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,879
that you two,

67
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,520
Cooperate well,

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,199
and do it well together.

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,599
I didn't expect that

70
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,400
you two

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,599
would embarrass yourself.

72
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,840
You even have to engage in internal strife.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,879
Forget it this time.

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,959
It won't happen again.

75
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,079
Get out.

76
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:31,959
Gu Qiao,

77
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,879
stay here.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,759
Ge Zi,

79
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,160
her father's illness,

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
How's it going now?

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,720
I just had surgery,

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,519
and I'm recovering well.

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,519
When will the copyright contract

84
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,399
be finalized?

85
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,839
I'll sign the contract this afternoon.

86
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,839
price

87
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,879
It's the same as what we talked about before,

88
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,560
right?

89
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,199
Not bad.

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,920
Gu Qiao,

91
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,920
in fact, sometimes

92
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,879
you don't have to care too much about things.

93
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,160
The way others see you,

94
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,000
the most important thing is the result.

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,279
You have a lot of potential.

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Keep up the good work.

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,839
Mr. Fu,

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,600
Me,

99
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,120
All right,

100
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,439
get back to work.

101
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,399
Hello, Yanxi.

102
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,120
What's wrong?

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
Hello, Master,

104
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,800
where have you been recently?

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,160
Why haven't you come to the company?

106
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,279
I have something personal.

107
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,439
I heard from Mr. Fu,

108
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,680
Uncle is seriously ill,

109
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,639
not that serious.

110
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,800
The surgery is done.

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,079
She's recovering.

112
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,279
I can go back to the company in a few days.

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,959
Is there something wrong with the company?

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,519
No

115
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,040
Everything is going well in the company.

116
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,839
Don't worry.

117
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,920
Master,

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,279
which hospital are you in now?

119
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,480
I want to visit my uncle.

120
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,519
It's okay.

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Don't bother.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,959
Get back to work.

123
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,600
These days,

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,040
you've worked so hard.

125
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,399
Master.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Do you always treat me

127
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,800
as an outsider in your heart,

128
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,360
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,079
Nothing.

130
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
I just suddenly

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,959
miss the old days,

132
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,920
Before Gu Qiao came to Shanghai,

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
all your work,

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,959
They all took me with them.

135
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,079
If something happens at home,

136
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,639
you must be

137
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,800
the first to tell me,

138
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,879
Do you remember?

139
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,360
When you were on a business trip,

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,839
I went to your house

141
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,680
to pick up the express delivery for you.

142
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,600
But I feel like you've changed recently.

143
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,040
Yeon-hee,

144
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,759
I know that at work,

145
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe you and Gu Qiao have some conflicts,

146
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,360
but the two of you,

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
They are all people I value.

148
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,959
Especially you.

149
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,560
You're very good at business,

150
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
so sometimes,

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,879
I'll be more strict with you.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,319
It's for your own good.

153
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,559
Really?

154
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,919
Of course.

155
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay,

156
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,039
Master. Get back to work.

157
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I'll hang up now.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,639
Goodbye.

159
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
Uncle, I'm here to see you.

160
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Do you miss me?

161
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,080
Gu Qiao,

162
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,639
I just want you to chat with me.

163
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,480
Have a seat.

164
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay,

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,799
I'll put the flowers in first.

166
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
I need to change the water.

167
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,279
Give it to me.

168
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,919
I'm going to wash the dishes.

169
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,720
It's not a big deal.

170
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,200
Thank you so much.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,039
Thank you, good man.

172
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,919
Can you take it?

173
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,360
Don't fall.

174
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,159
Mom, I'm not a kid.

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,039
No,

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,759
Tell me

177
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,519
What a nerd. Sun Bin

178
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,200
is so warm-hearted.

179
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,320
Aunt,

180
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
your son is kind-hearted,

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,360
It's useless to be kind.

182
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,960
I haven't even found

183
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,039
a date yet.

184
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
It's not all his fault.

185
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,919
What do you mean?

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
It's not his fault.

187
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,399
Then whose reason is it?

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm here.

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,559
There are many reasons,

190
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,240
Gu Qiao,

191
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:40,679
Come out with me.

192
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,960
I don't mean it. But tell me,

193
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:42,919
Wait a minute.

194
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,759
I'll talk to you later.

195
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,639
I'll talk about it when I get back.

196
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,559
What do you mean

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,519
by that? She

198
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,840
makes me feel uncomfortable.

199
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,799
The young man opened his mouth and said,

200
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,799
"No brains.

201
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
This … This

202
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,480
What's wrong?

203
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,840
What's going on between you and Jeong Yeon Hee?

204
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
Did she complain to you?

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,639
She didn't say anything.

206
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,879
What's wrong with you two?

207
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,039
There are just some differences.

208
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,120
You are a few years old.

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,519
Can't you make way?

210
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,440
You're not even a few years old, okay?

211
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,399
Well,

212
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,679
for your sake,

213
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,840
Don't argue with her.

214
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,480
Why do you like

215
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,639
coming here so much?

216
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,080
Come and watch the camera,

217
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,799
because I've been here

218
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,440
with my parents before.

219
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,879
Eggplant!

220
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,919
Ling Ling,

221
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,559
look, there's a photographer over there,

222
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,600
Do you want to take a photo?

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,159
Yes

224
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,519
Come on, let's line up

225
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,639
and watch the camera,

226
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,960
Look at the camera.

227
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,080
Follow my instructions.

228
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,000
Three, two, one. Is watermelon sweet?

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,399
Sweet,

230
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay.

231
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,919
-Pay for the photos at the exit. -Okay. Let's go to

232
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,879
the next group.

233
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,639
-Let's go over there. -Hurry!

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,519
Okay. Let's go

235
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,360
and look at the camera.

236
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,440
So cute.

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,159
Smile.

238
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,679
Is watermelon sweet?

239
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,600
Sweet,

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,159
Alright,

241
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,879
why don't we

242
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,320
take a picture together?

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,159
It's not easy for you

244
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,960
to come here as a souvenir.

245
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,039
You misunderstood.

246
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,159
Dad, I'm here

247
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,240
to take a picture with me.

248
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,120
Let's go.

249
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,120
Okay,

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
Look at the camera.

251
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,480
Three, two,

252
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
one. Is watermelon sweet?

253
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
Sweet.

254
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,600
Look at the camera.

255
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,200
A family of three is so sweet.

256
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,200
-Let's go. -Pay

257
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,159
for the photos at the exit.

258
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,679
Thank you.

259
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,759
Let's go, Ling Ling.

260
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,279
Let's go to the next group.

261
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:46,639
Okay,

262
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,720
Come and stand this way.

263
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,759
Dad,

264
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,600
I want to play there.

265
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,399
-Sure. -Over there. -Sure.

266
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,279
Go.

267
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:53,799
Be careful.

268
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,159
Ling Ling, be careful.

269
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,879
Okay,

270
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,120
Okay,

271
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,159
Very good.

272
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,600
Pay for the photos at the exit. Is it

273
00:12:59,600 --> 00:12:59,879
hot?

274
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,279
Thank you.

275
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
Take a break then.

276
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,360
Okay,

277
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,399
It's our turn

278
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,840
for the next group.

279
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,320
Here we go.

280
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
Stand still. Stand still.

281
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,919
Come closer.

282
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,159
They make

283
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
a lot of money here.

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay,

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,399
You'll make money.

286
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,399
You can earn it no matter what.

287
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,320
Take a good picture of me.

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,600
You can't make any money.

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I can't make any money.

290
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
It's really nice.

291
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,840
Look how happy you are.

292
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,600
Do you know

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,480
what Matthew effect is?

294
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,759
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,240
I have to give him double what I have.

296
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Call him redundant.

297
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,399
Whoever doesn't have it,

298
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,039
he'll take away everything he has.

299
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
This is called Matthew effect.

300
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,320
Where is the owner of this botanical garden?

301
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,840
He has a lot of assets,

302
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,759
so he built this amusement park,

303
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,399
It can make

304
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,320
his assets more.

305
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,600
In economics,

306
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,399
to put it simply,

307
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,759
The richer the rich,

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,240
the poorer the poor,

309
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,639
Wouldn't I be poorer and poorer?

310
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,840
But there's another saying,

311
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,240
man will conquer nature.

312
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,240
Look,

313
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,399
you've worked hard

314
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
to make yourself rich, haven't you?

315
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,559
Mr. Xiong, do you trade stocks?

316
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,559
I'll do it.

317
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,840
I've been trading stocks since I graduated from college,

318
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,919
so I'm considered an old stockholder.

319
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,360
Can you teach me?

320
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,960
All investments

321
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
are risky.

322
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,559
You only see the high returns

323
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,679
from stocks.

324
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,799
without seeing

325
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,919
the risks behind it,

326
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,000
I went through the stock market turbulence

327
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,159
in 2007 and 15,

328
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,440
There are people around who borrow money to trade stocks,

329
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
and some who raise funds to trade stocks,

330
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,519
In the end, I lost everything.

331
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,320
There are plenty of people here.

332
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,799
But

333
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,600
It's not that you can't invest in stocks.

334
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,679
You have to have a way.

335
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,879
What method?

336
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,679
How about this?

337
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,679
Let me introduce you to some stocks,

338
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,679
You can buy it

339
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,399
with your spare cash.

340
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,279
Let me help you with the specific operation.

341
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,879
You don't have to worry about the rest.

342
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,919
Really?

343
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,440
Okay,

344
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
but

345
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
I don't know if you can earn more or less,

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
but I won't let you lose money.

347
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,399
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

348
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,039
Where's Ling Ling?

349
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,279
Ling Ling,

350
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,279
Ling Ling,

351
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
Master,

352
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,759
I'm here.

353
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,720
Dad,

354
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,919
do you think this place looks like a water curtain cave?

355
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,840
Do I look like Sun Wukong?

356
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,039
Like,

357
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,039
Come down.

358
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,679
Drink some water. It's too hot, Ling Ling

359
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,039
Okay.

360
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,840
Look at you. Eat me when you come up.

361
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,720
I won't stand on ceremony.

362
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,679
Sun,

363
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,799
I've always wanted to ask you a question,

364
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,639
Look at you,

365
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,919
Yes and sensible,

366
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,799
You're dutiful to your mother,

367
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
and considerate to others,

368
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,720
You have a good job in finance,

369
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,919
and you have a good education.

370
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,559
Why are you still single?

371
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,200
Don't tell me you have a high opinion.

372
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,919
Uncle, don't laugh at me.

373
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
Honest people like us

374
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,919
are not popular.

375
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,200
Others picked on us.

376
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,840
Where's my mom?

377
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,759
I just arrived in Shanghai,

378
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,840
and I don't know the market.

379
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,519
That's why Madam Wang sells melons every day.

380
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,720
You flatter yourself.

381
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,799
Don't be too pessimistic.

382
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,240
Then can you tell me,

383
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,639
what kind of boys

384
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
do

385
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,240
young girls

386
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
like now?

387
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,600
Then.

388
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,559
You have to ask them

389
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,480
where they are,

390
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
You're right.

391
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,679
It's your turn. It's my turn to go. It's my turn to go

392
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,080
You.

393
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,320
We're in the army,

394
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,879
Me,

395
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,399
I'm a vaulting horse.

396
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
Hey,

397
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,200
Did you get off work?

398
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,159
You got off work so early?

399
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,399
Gu Qiao said she was tired,

400
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,240
so she asked me to accompany her home first.

401
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,879
You're at home now. Sir,

402
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll change the address.

403
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,319
I'll send it to you later.

404
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,039
Where are you?

405
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm back now.

406
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,599
Now in the car,

407
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,880
on the way to your house,

408
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not me.

409
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,039
You just got off the plane.

410
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,000
You must be very tired.

411
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,960
Go back and rest.

412
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,400
I'll see you

413
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,279
tomorrow

414
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,240
at the company, right?

415
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
No matter how much we see each other in the company,

416
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,400
we're colleagues.

417
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,160
I haven't been back for a long time.

418
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
The first thing I do when I come back,

419
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,519
I have to meet my girlfriend.

420
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,720
Why don't we have breakfast together tomorrow?

421
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,440
I know a very good breakfast shop

422
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,200
far away

423
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,680
from the company,

424
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,240
You really don't want to see me?

425
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,200
It's not me.

426
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,039
Okay,

427
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,160
I see. I see.

428
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,599
You removed your makeup, right?

429
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,400
It's okay. I don't dislike you.

430
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,640
See you later.

431
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll wait for you downstairs.

432
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,880
Yuan Ge,

433
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
I'm already downstairs.

434
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:06,920
See you later,

435
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,440
Bingwen.

436
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,079
Where did you come from?

437
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,640
Aren't you at home?

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,480
Me,

439
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,920
Am I particularly haggard?

440
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:44,559
Me

441
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,000
I was so anxious to come back to see you,

442
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
but I didn't even clean myself up.

443
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,279
Yes.

444
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,119
You must be tired

445
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,039
after traveling to so many cities.

446
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,839
Go back and rest early.

447
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,039
I do feel a little sleepy.

448
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,480
Now give me a bed,

449
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,960
I can sleep on it for three days and three nights,

450
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,799
How about this?

451
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,920
I'll go back and recharge my energy,

452
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,960
I'll go on a good date with you.

453
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,680
I'll get going then.

454
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,559
Go ahead.

455
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,319
You.

456
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
Did you miss me?

457
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,160
Why do you keep asking me

458
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,000
this question,

459
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,799
Because I want to confirm,

460
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,240
if you really

461
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,480
become my girlfriend.

462
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,839
Of course it is.

463
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm so happy.

464
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,920
Gu Qiao,

465
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
I've never had one.

466
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,279
Thank you so much.

467
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,559
I'm not good at

468
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,880
expressing myself.

469
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
She has always been lacking

470
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
in her family.

471
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,839
Thank you for showing up,

472
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,000
filling in the blank of Lingling.

473
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,839
Mr. Xiong, you're welcome.

474
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,160
Ling Ling and I are destined for each other,

475
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,000
and I'm happy to be with Ling Ling.

476
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,599
Most importantly,

477
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,759
she actually cured me.

478
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:51,960
In private,

479
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,400
don't call me Mr. Xiong.

480
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,599
My friends call me.

481
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,599
Qiming,

482
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,519
Xiao Ming,

483
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,960
Bear,

484
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,839
anything is fine.

485
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,799
Actually,

486
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,640
I've found some tutors

487
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
for Ling Ling before,

488
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,839
But Ling Ling's attitude towards them,

489
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,680
has never been

490
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
the most sensitive

491
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,359
to a child like you,

492
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,240
Who really likes her?

493
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,359
She can feel it.

494
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,839
So I believe

495
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
you must like Ling Ling

496
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,559
from the bottom of your heart.

497
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,200
Ling Ling is so cute,

498
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,799
I'm sure everyone will like her.

499
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
Is it hot?

500
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,079
It fits perfectly.

501
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,559
Tell me if it's hot.

502
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,599
Mei,

503
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,960
why are you here?

504
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm here to see your father.

505
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:32,839
Dad,

506
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,200
This is my boss.

507
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,640
Mr. Fu,

508
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,799
Mr. Fu,

509
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,640
You're here.

510
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,920
Old man,

511
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,599
I should have

512
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,680
come to see you a long time ago.

513
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,279
-Get some water for Mr. Fu. -Okay,

514
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,319
okay,

515
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:44,759
Mei,

516
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,680
sit down.

517
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Sit down.

518
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,640
I'll fetch you some water first.

519
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,519
There's no water in the thermos. Sit down,

520
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,559
Mr. Fu. Sit down.

521
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,480
Old man,

522
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,200
I should have done it earlier,

523
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,319
So I came to see you.

524
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,039
But there are so many things in the company

525
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:55,759
that I can't leave.

526
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,039
How are you feeling?

527
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,079
If you need any help,

528
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,640
just let me know.

529
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,119
Thank you, Mr. Fu,

530
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,640
but I just had a minor surgery.

531
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,960
I feel much better now.

532
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,960
In the past two days,

533
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,759
I've been urging Yuan Ge,

534
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,960
When I go to work in the company,

535
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,880
I'm afraid she'll delay

536
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,279
the progress of the company,

537
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,359
No.

538
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,279
Nothing is more important

539
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,880
than your health.

540
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,200
Ge Zi is so busy with work all day,

541
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,519
and he doesn't have a chance to take care of you.

542
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,480
Now that you're sick,

543
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,440
what's more important

544
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
than being with you,

545
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,279
So you need to take good care of yourself.

546
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,039
Actually, Old Man,

547
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,279
I just want to tell you,

548
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,279
I always feel guilty

549
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,640
in my heart.

550
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,240
Because,

551
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,359
Ge Zi,

552
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,720
You've raised

553
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,079
such an excellent daughter,

554
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,359
But I kept her

555
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,079
trapped

556
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,559
in that small office all day,

557
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,559
Over the years,

558
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,039
I've really delayed her youth.

559
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
She's still

560
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,319
single.

561
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
Mr. Fu, don't say that,

562
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,880
what about the marriage of young people?

563
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,359
Look,

564
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,640
marriage, marriage,

565
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
It's about fate.

566
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,759
This is urgent,

567
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,640
don't you think?

568
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,240
So I'm saying,

569
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,720
as long as you see

570
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,000
Ge Zi doing things normally,

571
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,119
I knew it.

572
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,200
She must have

573
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,359
a very reasonable father,

574
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm flattered.

575
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,799
But don't worry,

576
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,359
I've made up my mind.

577
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,640
After that, the company's situation

578
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,000
began to stabilize.

579
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,319
What about me this year?

580
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,920
I'll do it myself,

581
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,960
and I'll make sure that within this year,

582
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,559
Find her a good home.

583
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,039
Don't worry.

584
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,559
I always say

585
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,839
Yuan Ge is lucky,

586
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,720
To meet such a good boss like you,

587
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,039
I really love her.

588
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,119
Yes, she told me.

589
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,000
I know.

590
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,799
Leopard

591
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,160
Wait a minute.

592
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
you go find Dean Zhang.

593
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,440
Say hello to him.

594
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,599
Ask Old Man to transfer to the VIP ward.

595
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll pay for it.

596
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,519
Okay,

597
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,200
Mr. Fu,

598
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
it doesn't matter.

599
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,680
My dad will be discharged in a couple of days.

600
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Yes, yes.

601
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Don't bother.

602
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,119
I'm fine here.

603
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
It's me.

604
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,279
It's because I'm too busy,

605
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,519
otherwise I would have come.

606
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm already very moved that you're here.

607
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,440
Mr. Fu, you

608
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,000
… You are very busy at work,

609
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,559
I don't want to waste your time.

610
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,559
No,

611
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,000
Yuan Yuan Ge,

612
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,240
Mei,

613
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,279
you're welcome.

614
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,200
Go back to your work.

615
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,720
I'll take care of Old Man.

616
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,400
Then.

617
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,680
I'm sorry.

618
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,480
Then I won't disturb your rest.

619
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,200
I'll do it.

620
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
What I can help is

621
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,920
to ask Ge Zi to work less and spend more time with you.

622
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,559
Thank you.

623
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,480
Then you can stay here.

624
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,240
Take a good rest

625
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,960
first.

626
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,440
Send this to Mr. Fu

627
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,799
now,

628
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,119
Here, take this.

629
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,799
I can't do that.

630
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,839
It's my intention. I can't do that.

631
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,759
Yuan Ge, Yuan Ge,

632
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,079
You're too kind, Mei.

633
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,000
It has nothing to do with you.

634
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,759
It's my wish to come here.

635
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,640
Just accept it.

636
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,039
I'll visit you when I have time.

637
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,359
Thank you.

638
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,519
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

639
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,000
Send Mr. Fu off now.

640
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:14,440
Okay,

641
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:15,920
Mei,

642
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
let me see you off.

643
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,319
Goodbye.

644
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,160
Goodbye. Goodbye.

645
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,440
Yuan, well

646
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,599
… Well … Well … Well …,

647
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
He's Yuan Ge's boss.

648
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,240
Boss Yuan Ge

649
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,039
just now,

650
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
You're so respectable.

651
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,400
His boss came to see you.

652
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,799
What kind of face do I have?

653
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,440
It's all for my daughter's sake. I … I'm telling

654
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,599
you,

655
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,240
I think Yuan Ge,

656
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,640
the more I look at her now,

657
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,079
the more I like her. How beautiful is she?

658
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,519
And he's kind

659
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,599
and modest.

660
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,119
She's really single.

661
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,759
Single?

662
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,519
What about what I told you last time?

663
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,880
About these two children, do you

664
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,440
… Do you take it to heart?

665
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:07,519
I remember.

666
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,000
I remember.

667
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,119
She's Aunt Sun,

668
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,480
but I'm not against it.

669
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,920
I think about young people,

670
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,160
we should let them

671
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,519
decide for themselves.

672
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,640
Am I right?

673
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,920
So boring.

674
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,519
It's fun to do Tai Chi there

675
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,720
all day.

676
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,759
Aunt Sun,

677
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,799
this fruit basket from Mr. Fu,

678
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
What kind of fruit do you like?

679
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,519
Let me wash it for you.

680
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,839
I don't like fruit.

681
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,440
Mr. Fu,

682
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
I'll get the car first.

683
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,680
Mei,

684
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,079
I'll go back to the company tomorrow.

685
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,759
There's no need to rush.

686
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,480
It's rare for you

687
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,720
to get along with him like this,

688
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,680
Stay with your dad.

689
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,359
Thank you.

690
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,920
In fact,

691
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,119
even if you didn't tell me,

692
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,559
I know about

693
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,960
your mother, too,

694
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,039
It has always been

695
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,599
the knot between your father and daughter,

696
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,759
If he doesn't stay in the hospital this time,

697
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,599
you may not be able to

698
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,880
untie him.

699
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,240
You know what?

700
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,759
In our time,

701
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,480
life and environment were really hard,

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,279
As long as you have a child,

703
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
your first thought,

704
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
I just want to make money,

705
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
so I can't let my child

706
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,680
continue to live a miserable life like this.

707
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,240
Actually,

708
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,160
I kind of understand my dad now.

709
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,799
But at that time, I thought

710
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,119
money was second.

711
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,039
Companion is the most important thing.

712
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,160
But at that time, I thought,

713
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,640
there were better conditions.

714
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,839
is responsible for the child.

715
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,960
Mei,

716
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
how is Baona?

717
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,000
Didn't I promise

718
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,359
to visit her in America last time?

719
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,119
It wasn't that I didn't make it.

720
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
From then on,

721
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,920
She ignored me again.

722
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,039
Now,

723
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,680
if I want to know about her,

724
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,119
We can only ask about it from her father.

725
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,400
But I know,

726
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
she was going to report to the university

727
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,359
last month.

728
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,160
She's been clamoring

729
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,839
to rent a house by herself these days,

730
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,920
Take your time.

731
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,319
Baona is still young,

732
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,920
Didn't my dad and I

733
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,680
just break up with each other?

734
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,920
I know I can't rush it.

735
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,799
Ever since I decided

736
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,119
to sacrifice my family

737
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,480
for my career,

738
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
I already knew that

739
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,680
I would bear this result.

740
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,680
There's no turning back.

741
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,279
I can only keep walking.

742
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,960
Now I just hope

743
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,839
Baona can be like you,

744
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,279
Eventually,

745
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,359
she'll understand what her parents are going through,

746
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,319
Of course I will.

747
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,359
Why do I nag so much?

748
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,599
You don't have to see me off.

749
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,000
Go back and stay with me.

750
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,119
Mei, thank you.

751
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,240
You're welcome.

752
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
Let's go back.

753
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,640
That's it, then,

754
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,200
Okay,

755
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Mr. Fu,

756
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:28,839
come in.

757
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,200
Mr. Du,

758
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,519
why did you come to work

759
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,640
as soon as you came back.

760
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,319
Aren't you supposed to rest at home

761
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,440
for a few days?

762
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,039
Young.

763
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,160
One night's rest is enough.

764
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
And I'm in a hurry to come back

765
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
and report my results to you.

766
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,640
How's it going?

767
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
The four stores in Beishangguangshen and Shenzhen

768
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,559
all opened simultaneously this month.

769
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,640
They are all in the most prosperous areas,

770
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,400
with our publicity,

771
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,920
Li Meng's brand status,

772
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,400
will be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

773
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,319
Bingwen,

774
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,400
you really did a great job

775
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,640
for the company this time.

776
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,920
I'm so happy about this.

777
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,599
I'm going to tell Gezi later,

778
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,440
so that she can be happy.

779
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,480
During this period of time,

780
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
she has been working really hard.

781
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,279
You've lost a lot of weight.

782
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,480
I didn't see Mr. Yuan

783
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,240
come to work today,

784
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,079
Her father had an operation,

785
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,599
so Ge Zi stayed with him in the hospital.

786
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,599
I just came back from the hospital,

787
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,920
but her father

788
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,319
should be almost recovered.

789
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:44,720
What's wrong?

790
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,039
I heard that the copyright matter has been settled.

791
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
I'm telling you,

792
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,000
I'll do it myself,

793
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,279
Is there anything that can't be solved?

794
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,000
Which hospital?

795
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,599
What? Which hospital?

796
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,079
Which hospital?

797
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,839
Ge Ge didn't tell you

798
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,440
because she didn't want you to worry.

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,280
Which hospital?

800
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,480
Shanghai Hospital.

801
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,840
What are you doing?

802
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,159
Old man, you're cheating

803
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,880
No

804
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
You're such a thief. I'm telling you,

805
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,920
you didn't.

806
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:47,559
No

807
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm telling you,

808
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,159
in-laws. You're such a slick guy.

809
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,519
You don't have a grandson,

810
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,239
Sun, do you think

811
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,519
that's what happened just now?

812
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,920
That's right. He was just like that.

813
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,599
Who are you looking for?

814
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,559
Du,

815
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,559
This is your friend,

816
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,159
Yuan Ge,

817
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,639
My colleague,

818
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,119
Yes.

819
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,239
Colleague,

820
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,599
I'm here on behalf of the company

821
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,800
to deliver something to uncle.

822
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,440
-Thank you. -Thank you. Your

823
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,119
daughter is really capable,

824
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,280
Her colleagues

825
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
line up to see you every day.

826
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,800
I'll leave after seeing you off.

827
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,119
I'll leave you to it.

828
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,679
Thank you, young man.

829
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,280
This kid is really,

830
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,679
your colleague is out of his mind,

831
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,519
Kids nowadays

832
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,280
are like this.

833
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,599
It's not touching at all.

834
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,280
Tell me,

835
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,239
he seems to be out of his mind,

836
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,960
Uncle,

837
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,800
it's your turn.

838
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,679
Play chess,

839
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,559
Du Bingwen,

840
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,159
Du Bingwen!

841
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,480
Du Bingwen! Stop right there!

842
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,199
Listen to me,

843
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,320
Tell me.

844
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,840
If you didn't put my dad

845
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
in the hospital

846
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,039
because of me,

847
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,760
If I tell you,

848
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,719
I can explain,

849
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,760
You explain. I'll listen.

850
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,199
Tell me,

851
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,679
I just found out suddenly that

852
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,639
my dad is going to have an operation.

853
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,519
On the day you went on a business trip,

854
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,880
I didn't want you to know about it.

855
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,679
I was distracted.

856
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
That's why I didn't tell you.

857
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,280
When did I...?

858
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
Because of what happened between us,

859
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
it affected our work,

860
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,880
You just don't need me.

861
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,719
Please don't

862
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,920
misinterpret my meaning.

863
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,840
What does that mean?

864
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:21,760
All right,

865
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,599
I'll do as you say,

866
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
Last night,

867
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,639
I went downstairs

868
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,960
to your house last night.

869
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,039
Why didn't you tell me?

870
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
Well,

871
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,320
during this period of time,

872
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,239
I had a lot of contact

873
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,079
with my dad at the hospital,

874
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,360
I found that he kept

875
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,719
urging me to get married.

876
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,199
Well,

877
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,159
Me,

878
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,039
I think,

879
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,880
if I let him know that

880
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,039
I have a boyfriend,

881
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,880
I'm sure he'll force me

882
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,719
to put marriage on the agenda.

883
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,119
You,

884
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,599
I think we're just getting started.

885
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,679
I'm not sure about many things.

886
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,119
I... I

887
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
didn't tell my dad.

888
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,400
I just.

889
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,239
I don't want my dad to know that

890
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,880
my mind is in a mess right now. You,

891
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,719
Can you give me some time?

892
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,280
Okay,

893
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,599
I'll give you some time.

894
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,519
Where's Uncle?

895
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,480
Sun Bin went for a walk with him.

896
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,079
I was wondering if you were too close

897
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,000
to Sun Bin.

898
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,719
He even took care of my uncle.

899
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,360
No.

900
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,719
It's not what you think.

901
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
Did you have a fight with Mr. Du?

902
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,880
You're really calm.

903
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,480
I won't tell you if I don't ask.

904
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,119
You don't even know,

905
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,199
but Second Brother Du knows,

906
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,639
When Uncle was hospitalized,

907
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,679
his face turned green.

908
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,320
You told him?

909
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,679
Mr. Fu said it.

910
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,199
She doesn't know about your relationship.

911
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,400
What are you thinking?

912
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Or,

913
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,119
you don't want me

914
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,000
to know at all,

915
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
The existence of Second Brother Du.

916
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,159
Not really.

917
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,679
As you know,

918
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,960
I've never been in a relationship,

919
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,559
Du Bingwen and I,

920
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,519
we're just getting started.

921
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
Actually, I don't know,

922
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,639
and I don't dare to think about it,

923
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,960
How could we get to

924
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,000
where we are?

925
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,679
Besides,

926
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,559
the company also banned

927
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,559
office romance,

928
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,719
Where's my dad?

929
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,280
And he urged me to get married and have children,

930
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,679
and now he wants them to meet,

931
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,320
That's why things get more complicated.

932
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,159
To put it bluntly,

933
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,760
you just don't trust Du Bingwen,

934
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,320
Actually, Uncle is right.

935
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,039
You're influenced

936
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,320
by your original family,

937
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,760
All these years,

938
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,119
you didn't fall in love,

939
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,480
I don't even think about marriage.

940
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,519
I just don't believe that marriage

941
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,960
can bring you happiness.

942
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,719
When my mom was alive,

943
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,800
she was busy with her family,

944
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,840
You live frugally every day,

945
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,639
thinking about

946
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,119
me and my dad.

947
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,000
But where's my dad?

948
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,679
I've been busy with my work,

949
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,800
going home every day,

950
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,920
She always quarrels with her

951
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,079
because of trivial matters.

952
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,079
My mom is so nice.

953
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,719
She still can't get

954
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,159
the happiness she wants.

955
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,920
So, in my opinion,

956
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,840
marriage is not the only way

957
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,480
to make people happy.

958
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,800
Ge Ge,

959
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,880
I think you're too extreme.

960
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,920
Not all families

961
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,639
are like yours.

962
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,800
I understand.

963
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,960
But I just want to live for myself.

964
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,599
You can live for yourself.

965
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,679
But you can't

966
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,000
stay in your own world forever,

967
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,519
You have to learn

968
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,920
to accept others'love for you.

969
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,599
You have to learn to give love.

970
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,960
Besides,

971
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,079
you're already

972
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,760
with Du Bingwen.

973
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,280
Then try to

974
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,519
move forward boldly.

975
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,360
Even if the result doesn't go well,

976
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,679
so what?

977
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,880
Look,

978
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,119
I'm doing well now,

979
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,000
aren't I?

980
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:01,960
Ge Ge,

981
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,599
Du Bingwen is a good man,

982
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,800
You have to learn to open your heart,

983
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,599
and let him know the real you.
