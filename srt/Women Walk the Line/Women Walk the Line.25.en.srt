1
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,920
I thought you didn't come back.

2
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,480
What do you think?

3
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,519
Did it go well?

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Good luck.

5
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,519
Jia Long's grandfather offered,

6
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,640
as long as we follow that side,

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,519
He was willing to come forward

8
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,280
when he terminated the cooperation,

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,599
I'll be interviewed by the media.

10
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,599
Speak for us.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,159
That's great.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,879
If he says a few words,

13
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,840
it's more useful than a hundred words

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
from our brand.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,439
I'll leave the follow-up PR to you.

16
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,120
This matter

17
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,599
has a big impact on Shumei.

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,159
Don't worry.

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
As for the PR,

20
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,280
just leave it to me.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,039
Have you asked Gu Qiao

22
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,840
if you're busy with other things?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes.

24
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,039
What the old painter saw that day,

25
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,360
it wasn't Gu Qiao at all.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,919
It was Zheng Yanxi

27
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,240
who lied about Gu Qiao's name

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,960
and framed him.

29
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,479
Oh my god.

30
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,919
Then.

31
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,879
Did you tell Gu Qiao about this?

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
Now I'm thinking,

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,680
what should I tell Mr. Fu?

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,879
If Mr. Fu finds out about this,

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
Jeong Yeon Hee won't be able to

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,080
stay in this company anymore.

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
It might make her

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
realize her mistake earlier,

39
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,639
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

40
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,159
All right,

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,319
let's go eat.

42
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,199
Don't wait.

43
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's go.

44
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
I'm so sleepy.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,639
Let's go.

46
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
Gu Qiao,

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,879
Mr. Xiong,

48
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,959
Why are you here?

49
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,319
I've heard everything

50
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,439
about the company,

51
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,120
I have no choice.

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,439
That's why I came here to guard you.

53
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,920
I went to the picturesque place,

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
looking for Mr. Wang,

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,839
Mr. Wang cried and made a scene,

56
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,839
and even jumped off the building.

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
I can only come to Bai Xue.

58
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,279
Only if she comes out to clarify,

59
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,560
this matter can be solved.

60
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,160
If you keep waiting like this,

61
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
it's not the way.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,439
But this is the only way

63
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,279
I can think of,

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
Even so,

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,879
you have to eat well.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,519
Let's go.

67
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
I'll take you to eat delicious food,

68
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,040
but I want to wait a little longer.

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,759
Okay,

70
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,319
I'll wait with you.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,720
Yanxi,

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,160
come to my office.

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
Close the door.

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Do you know why I'm looking for you?

75
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,279
Master, I was wrong.

76
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,399
I did

77
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,720
run into an old man

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,519
downstairs that day,

79
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,160
He said about Bai Xue's plagiarism,

80
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,920
but I thought,

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,759
He's a porcelain clicker,

82
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,920
so I drove him away.

83
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,680
I really didn't expect

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,439
such a serious consequence.

85
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,920
Did you really not expect that?

86
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,800
Master,

87
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,720
it's not what you think.

88
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,120
What's that?

89
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,800
You didn't mean to target Gu Qiao,

90
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,959
you didn't mean to frame him up,

91
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,639
It's not that you don't care about the company's interests.

92
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,480
Okay,

93
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,439
If you don't tell me, I'll do it for you.

94
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,399
You met Mr. Jia downstairs in the company,

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
you know,

96
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,399
Gu Qiao has always been in charge of

97
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,680
the cooperation project of Guoman.

98
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
So you want to borrow

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,680
the hand of an old painter,

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
You tricked Gu Qiao,

101
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,519
so you lied about

102
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,399
her name,

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,319
Is that so?

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,839
Back then,

105
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,079
why didn't you tell me?

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
If I find out,

107
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
I have other ways.

108
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,839
It can save the company

109
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,680
and not fall into

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
such a passive situation,

111
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Because that's the only way

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
you'll fire Gu Qiao.

113
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,279
Why did you

114
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,439
come this far,

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
I remember when you first graduated,

116
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,279
you came to Shu Mei,

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Even Mr. Fu praised you for being smart

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,319
and capable,

119
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sure he'll be very good in the future.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
But I didn't expect that,

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,399
in order to frame Gu Qiao,

122
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,680
Ignoring the interests of the company.

123
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,839
I just don't like her.

124
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,879
Before she came,

125
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,759
everything about you,

126
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,679
Leave it to me.

127
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,399
I'll go with you

128
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,600
when you meet your friends and clients.

129
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,759
But after she came,

130
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,399
everyone surrounded her.

131
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Hao Shuai

132
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,320
Yes, Mr. Du

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
even has Xiao Wang and Xia

134
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,360
around her now.

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,000
But do you know

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,080
what I care about the most?

137
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,080
What I care about the most is,

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
even you have changed now.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,519
Master, think about it,

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
how many clients do you have?

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
You didn't take me to many projects

142
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,799
and didn't ask me

143
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,799
to accompany you

144
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,720
to do them.

145
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,080
For all the glamorous jobs now,

146
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,159
she's the first one you think of.

147
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
In the end,

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,759
no one was left to do the hard work,

149
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,120
That's why it's my turn.

150
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
You can't see what I'm doing.

151
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,960
And Guangke,

152
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,879
she's good at work,

153
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,559
I just can't.

154
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,120
Why did you let her do it?

155
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,399
This is also my job.

156
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,639
Why did she take it?

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,840
So now

158
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,559
I just want you to see,

159
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,159
A Dou

160
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,080
who can't be helped up.

161
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,399
What good results did she have?

162
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,600
I know you have a strong sense of professionalism.

163
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,879
I've always reserved the position of Marketing Director

164
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,480
for you.

165
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,399
Forget it.

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,559
What you did,

167
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,919
I won't tell Mr. Fu,

168
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,799
and I won't fire you.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,919
But I'll give you time,

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
you can hand over the work

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,440
in your hand,

172
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,440
You can quit on your own.

173
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,399
Jia Long has agreed

174
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,360
to cooperate with us.

175
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,960
As long as we issue a statement,

176
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
we can sign the contract immediately.

177
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,200
Declare that I drafted

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
a picturesque document

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,759
and there's still no movement there.

180
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,879
Not yet,

181
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,759
but I heard from Leopard,

182
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,120
He said Bai Xue

183
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
has a lot of "stupid fans",

184
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,080
They don't just believe that

185
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,039
she didn't plagiarize.

186
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,960
And you're still

187
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,159
asking for Jia Long?

188
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,519
We have to expose the evidence

189
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,600
during the live broadcast,

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,720
If he doesn't have a concrete proof,

191
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,480
he has to do the opposite.

192
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,399
Ask him to apologize

193
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,279
and apologize to Bai Xue,

194
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,559
That is to say,

195
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,799
if we make

196
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,159
a statement now,

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
He unilaterally asked Bai Xue

198
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,360
to terminate the cooperation with us.

199
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,600
Will it make her "fans"

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,519
Turn us into arrow targets.

201
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,559
Mr. Fu,

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
I've seen that old painter before,

203
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,559
In my opinion, regarding plagiarism,

204
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,639
there is basically

205
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,679
no room for reversal.

206
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,240
What if we take the initiative

207
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,759
to terminate the contract now?

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,679
You still have the initiative.

209
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,799
But if Jia Long

210
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,919
releases the concrete proof,

211
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,879
Then we'll terminate it.

212
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,159
Then it will be a dying struggle.

213
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,759
That is to say,

214
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,360
in addition to

215
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
issuing this statement,

216
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,840
We have no other choice.

217
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,879
As far as the current situation is concerned,

218
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,600
there is no better way.

219
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,000
Bai Xue.

220
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,879
Bai Xue,

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,679
did you copy it or not?

222
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,639
No.

223
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,080
You didn't.

224
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,240
Why didn't you clarify it?

225
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,480
What's the use of clarifying?

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,399
He deliberately smeared me.

227
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,279
What can I do?

228
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,080
He said I plagiarized,

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,279
and I said he touched porcelain. I

230
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,799
… Shumei came to work with you with such

231
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,600
sincerity.

232
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,840
You can't just walk away.

233
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,200
Who signed the contract with you?

234
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Who are you looking for?

235
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,639
It has nothing to do with me.

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Mr. Jia,

237
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,559
I'm Gu Qiao, Shumei's employee,

238
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,279
As for the cooperation with Bai Xue,

239
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,159
I'm in charge.

240
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

241
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,679
I don't know if I can meet you,

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,919
but allow me to apologize to you

243
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,320
and your grandpa in person.

244
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
If Bai Xue didn't plagiarize,

245
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,399
it's very likely

246
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,360
that Jia Long lied,

247
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,440
I have to meet

248
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,279
Jia Long.

249
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,600
Jia Long,

250
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,759
what's going on?

251
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,840
The data is wrong again.

252
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,279
Manager,

253
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,919
I asked for leave two days ago,

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,200
I didn't do it.

255
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,600
You.

256
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,080
Is it meaningful to pass the buck now?

257
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,159
I'm the one

258
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,320
who asked you to do this.

259
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not looking for you.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,639
Who are you looking for?

261
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,639
I'm sorry, manager.

262
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,879
I'll sort it out right away.

263
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,240
At such a young age,

264
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
he always makes excuses when something goes wrong.

265
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,120
I don't know

266
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,519
who I learned it from.

267
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,799
Hurry up.

268
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,759
I'm waiting to use it.

269
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,039
Jia Long,

270
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
go to the president's office.

271
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
Mr. Xu wants to see you,

272
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,759
me,

273
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,120
Me.

274
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,039
Mr. Xiong, have some tea.

275
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,480
Mr. Xu,

276
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,720
Let's make a golf appointment some other day.

277
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,200
What do you think?

278
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,559
I heard that Mr. Xiong is a good player,

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,799
Mr. Xu,

280
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,799
Jia,

281
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
come in.

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,399
Mr. Xu,

283
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,480
why are you

284
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,600
standing here with me?

285
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,679
Come on, have a seat.

286
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,399
Mr. Xu,

287
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,759
I'm the one with the data,

288
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
It's my fault.

289
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,759
I've sorted it out.

290
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,640
I'll send it to you right away.

291
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Xiao Jia

292
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,480
That's not why I asked you to come here.

293
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,559
Let me introduce him to you.

294
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,839
What about this one?

295
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
It's Mr. Xiong from Guangke.

296
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,000
-Hello,

297
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Mr. Xiong. -Hello, Mr. Xiong.

298
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,200
Please have a seat.

299
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,279
Let's sit down and talk.

300
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,559
Mr. Xiong and I

301
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,119
have been good friends for many years.

302
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,319
He's here today.

303
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,359
Thank you.

304
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,440
I have a favor

305
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,279
to ask of you.

306
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,160
Mr. Xiong,

307
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,759
what can I do for you?

308
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,599
Just tell me.

309
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,359
If I can do it,

310
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,519
I'll do my best to help.

311
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,440
That's great.

312
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,519
We don't have to beat around the bush.

313
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
Here's the thing. Recently,

314
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,680
there was a comic plagiarism,

315
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,839
It's a big deal.

316
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,599
What about this?

317
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,119
It involves Shumei Company,

318
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,880
and Shumei and Guangke

319
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,000
are partners.

320
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,200
I heard that the original artist

321
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
of this work

322
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,279
is Mr. Jia, your grandfather,

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,759
I wonder if you're willing to help.

324
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,240
Mediate from it,

325
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,599
and make this

326
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,279
big thing

327
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,480
smaller.

328
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
My grandfather originally thought that

329
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,519
his work would get the attention

330
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,200
of outsiders again.

331
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,400
He is very happy.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,799
But Bai Xue,

333
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,119
without his knowledge,

334
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,400
You plagiarized his works.

335
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,240
And up to now,

336
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,440
he hasn't even given us an explanation.

337
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,440
This is

338
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,400
a huge disrespect to us,

339
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,680
Jia Long,

340
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,960
I understand.

341
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,559
We can understand

342
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,119
your grandpa's feelings,

343
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,160
Didn't you always

344
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
want to get promoted and transferred?

345
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,759
If you can

346
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,960
help me with this,

347
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,799
That's good.

348
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
Mr. Xiong's company

349
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,680
has a vacancy for a marketing manager,

350
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,519
You can think about it.

351
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,119
Mr. Xiong,

352
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,480
what do you want me to do?

353
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,720
It's easy.

354
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Persuade your grandpa.

355
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,720
Come forward and clarify it.

356
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,319
It's just a misunderstanding.

357
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,759
It's everyone's creative inspiration.

358
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
I bumped into him

359
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,079
Hello, Mr. Fu.

360
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,640
Hello, Gezi.

361
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,519
Go back to the company right now.

362
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,559
Jia Long came out and clarified that

363
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,400
it wasn't plagiarism,

364
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,720
Inspiration hit me.

365
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,720
Come back as soon as possible.

366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
Got it.

367
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,359
I was always worried.

368
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
Once we announce

369
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,519
the termination of our cooperation with Bai Xue,

370
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,960
Actually, it's hard to avoid.

371
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
We are going to face

372
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
a new group of professional gangsters,

373
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,839
But it's fine now.

374
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,119
Jia Long clarified that

375
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,599
everything was a misunderstanding.

376
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,599
That is to say,

377
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,839
all our difficulties

378
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,079
can be solved.

379
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,599
Mr. Fu,

380
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,279
I still think,

381
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,920
There's something fishy about this.

382
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,240
First of all, Jia Long's grandfather

383
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,559
doesn't seem like a liar.

384
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,480
And Jia Long has agreed

385
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,599
to cooperate with

386
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,799
Shu Mei,

387
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,880
Mr. Du also knows it.

388
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,119
Then why is he

389
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,000
at this critical moment,

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
It suddenly turned against the water?

391
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,799
It seems that you didn't surf the Internet just now.

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,119
Jia Long has posted a long article

393
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,480
on Weibo explaining

394
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,680
Jia Lao and Bai Xue's works?

395
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,039
Although there are similarities,

396
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,559
it is indeed

397
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
a collision of artistic inspiration.

398
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
And Mr. Fu and I

399
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
looked it up online,

400
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,920
This kind of thing is not uncommon

401
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
in literary circles.

402
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
but

403
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,359
You're too cautious Ge Zi,

404
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,440
in fact, this matter

405
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,079
has always been very strange.

406
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,920
They may be our competitors

407
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,599
from beginning to end.

408
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,039
You planned everything behind the scenes.

409
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
But I just didn't expect that

410
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,200
you and Bingwen could come up with

411
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,920
the idea of cooperating with Jia Long's grandfather,

412
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,279
To make a remedy.

413
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,359
So the other party might be afraid of getting caught.

414
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,359
So I stopped it immediately.

415
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,079
By the way, Mr. Fu,

416
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,240
now that things have been settled,

417
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,160
I think Gu Qiao should

418
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,319
go back to the company.

419
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,839
I heard from Mr. Du before,

420
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,359
for the sake of Guoman,

421
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,279
I've been working hard

422
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,319
and putting in a lot of effort.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,640
Since it has nothing

424
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,559
to do with her.

425
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,400
Then she should go back to the company.

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,799
Good for you.

427
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,079
Tell her to come back.

428
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,759
Hello, who are you looking for?

429
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,039
I'm looking for Jia Long.

430
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,960
I have an appointment with him.

431
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,079
Tell him and he'll know.

432
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,400
Jia Long,

433
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,160
he hasn't come to the company

434
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
for days.

435
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
He seems to have resigned.

436
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,119
Leave.

437
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,400
Have a seat.

438
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,200
Gu Qiao,

439
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,200
I know.

441
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,599
This has nothing to do with you.

442
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,400
But during this period of time,

443
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,680
the company's reputation has been seriously damaged.

444
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,480
I wanted to sign a contract

445
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
with an old painter,

446
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
After solving these problems in the company,

447
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,759
I'll find a way to get you back.

448
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,960
Jia Long has come out

449
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,319
to clarify it himself.

450
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,079
I also mentioned it to Mr. Fu,

451
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,680
and she agreed to let you go back to Shumei.

452
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,880
Actually, if I can't go back to Shumei's job,

453
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,519
for me,

454
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,559
It's really not that important.

455
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,759
When this happened,

456
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,000
I tried my best

457
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,519
to solve the problem.

458
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,799
But when I got back to the company,

459
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,480
the first thing I heard was,

460
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,079
Are you going to fire me?

461
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,720
At that time,

462
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,079
I couldn't accept it.

463
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,119
These days,

464
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,119
I've been thinking a lot.

465
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,519
Indeed,

466
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,119
from your point of view,

467
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,480
I can understand you, too.

468
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,200
Gu Qiao,

469
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,799
it's me.

470
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,240
Hey,

471
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I'll be right down.

472
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm sorry,

473
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,759
I suddenly have something urgent,

474
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,559
It's okay.

475
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,359
Go back to work.

476
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,839
Okay.

477
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,720
Wait a minute.

478
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,039
You're finally back, Gu Qiao.

479
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,480
Let's welcome Gu Qiao.

480
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,079
Thank you.

481
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,519
I told you,

482
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,920
you usually work so hard,

483
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,759
It's impossible for the company

484
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,640
to fire you.

485
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,799
It's all Jia Long's

486
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,319
fault. Why are you fooling around?

487
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,119
But Jia Long

488
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,960
is quite strange.

489
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,400
He promised that

490
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
he would pursue it to the end,

491
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,279
But now he came out to clarify it himself.

492
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,200
He just broke the news on purpose

493
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,359
to attract attention.

494
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,400
But what good will it do him?

495
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,079
Now he has been scolded by others.

496
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,279
If you scold him or not,

497
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,799
at least he's famous now.

498
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,279
That's right.

499
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,920
There are so many of them now.

500
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,440
He did whatever it takes to be famous.

501
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,880
All right, all right,

502
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,319
let's not talk about it,

503
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,559
I won't disturb your work.

504
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,119
Come on!

505
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:28,960
Two.

506
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,240
Ling Ling,

507
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,480
we've been playing for a long time.

508
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,839
It's time to go to class, okay?

509
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,359
Gu Qiao,

510
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,079
it's been a long time

511
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,599
since you came to my house to play with me.

512
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,799
I wonder

513
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,720
when will you be able to come next time?

514
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,359
Just play with me a little longer.

515
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,759
It's true that my sister was too busy before,

516
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,720
so she didn't come.

517
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,839
I'm sorry,

518
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,680
but it's all settled,

519
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,559
I can come

520
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,039
and play with you often in the future.

521
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,319
Really?

522
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,319
That's great.

523
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,400
Then we'll go upstairs.

524
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,759
Let's go.

525
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,440
Ling Ling has to listen to your sister and attend class.

526
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,240
Okay,

527
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,200
Go up and get ready.

528
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,920
I need to talk to my sister.

529
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,200
Go ahead.

530
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,319
Wait for me up there.

531
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,680
Be good,

532
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,440
-Hurry up. -I'll go.

533
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,559
Sit down.

534
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,920
I heard you went back to Shu Mei.

535
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,359
It's good that

536
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,039
everything is settled.

537
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,640
Mr. Xiong,

538
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,880
you're not helping me

539
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,000
with Jia Long, are you?

540
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,400
I did help you last time.

541
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,000
After all, I know Mr. Wang,

542
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,319
but this has nothing to do with me.

543
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
Maybe from the beginning to the end,

544
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,559
Jia Long was the one

545
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,480
who was directing and acting,

546
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,440
Not necessarily.

547
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,839
But,

548
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,440
have you ever heard of

549
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,640
herd effect?

550
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,440
When an individual

551
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,200
makes a judgment consciously

552
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,880
or unconsciously

553
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,920
based on the opinions of the majority.

554
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,720
Most people don't care

555
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,680
about the truth,

556
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,160
All I care about

557
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,039
is what I can get from it?

558
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,079
For example, on the internet,

559
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,240
a lot of people

560
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,200
see cheating,

561
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,240
Plagiarism,

562
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,799
showing off wealth and other words.

563
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,359
No one will verify the truth

564
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,799
in the first place.

565
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
Or maybe in this case,

566
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,359
everyone is eager to express

567
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,640
their hatred for the plagiarists,

568
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,680
Dissatisfied with the injustice of society.

569
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,759
Or just to enjoy it,

570
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,960
to stand on a moral high,

571
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,799
To criticize the pleasure of others.

572
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,079
So in the end,

573
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,359
it doesn't matter

574
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,319
if it's true or not.

575
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,359
I see.

576
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,559
I'm going to teach Ling Ling.

577
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Thank you for your hard work.

578
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:24,720
Mr. Yuan,

579
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,279
Mr. Jia, take a seat.

580
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,119
I'll do it myself.

581
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Sorry,

582
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,319
it's raining so hard,

583
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,480
I'm sorry to trouble you to come.

584
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,759
It's okay, Mr. Yuan.

585
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,400
About my grandfather,

586
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,279
Shu Mei has been

587
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,119
troubled so much,

588
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
Actually, I feel guilty.

589
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,799
It's okay,

590
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,240
actually,

591
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm just curious

592
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,000
about one thing,

593
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,000
Didn't you say the day before yesterday,

594
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,240
you'd sign a cooperation contract with Shu Mei?

595
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,039
I'm really sorry, Mr. Yuan.

596
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,160
Here's the thing.

597
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,960
I didn't expect things

598
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,920
to turn out this way.

599
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,079
After my grandfather

600
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,200
saw your commercial on TV,

601
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,799
Just say

602
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,519
it's plagiarizing his work.

603
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
He even went to your company

604
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,720
to seek justice.

605
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,680
Later, I went to an expert for identification,

606
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,079
and the expert said that

607
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
this is not plagiarism,

608
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,680
If it continues to ferment,

609
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,160
to Shu Mei,

610
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,279
It's not good for my grandpa.

611
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,000
So,

612
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,640
I came out specifically to clarify.

613
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,680
It's okay,

614
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,480
Mr. Yuan.

615
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,480
I have something else to do.

616
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,440
I'm leaving now.

617
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,240
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,880
Thank you for sending me back.

619
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,079
Wait for me.

620
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,640
It's raining

621
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,359
heavily. Be careful.

622
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,279
Let's go.

623
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,039
It's raining heavily.

624
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,960
Are you okay?

625
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,519
It's okay.

626
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:21,680
Are you wet?

627
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,240
Thank you.

628
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,200
It's okay.

629
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,039
Thank you for sending me back.

630
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,599
It's okay.

631
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,680
Go upstairs.

632
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,480
Me,

633
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
Let me see you go.

634
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,759
I'll go up again.

635
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,359
All right,

636
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,960
go to bed early.

637
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,599
Be careful.

638
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,400
Goodbye.

639
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,279
Goodbye.

640
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,759
You're wet, too.

641
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,240
Have some ginger cola.

642
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,279
I'll get changed first.

643
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:21,720
Thank you.

644
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,279
Okay.

645
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,240
The rain is really heavy.

646
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,599
Dad,

647
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,599
Why are you still up?

648
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,799
I slept too much in the afternoon

649
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,640
and couldn't sleep at night,

650
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,920
You work overtime every day.

651
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,240
The company is so busy,

652
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,400
There's been a lot going on lately,

653
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,240
so you've made progress.

654
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,319
You used to skip meals when you were busy,

655
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,359
but now you still know to eat on time.

656
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,720
This should be Gu Qiao's credit.

657
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,319
Today in my hometown,

658
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,720
your uncle Li called me,

659
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
How is my recovery?

660
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,799
When are you going back?

661
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,799
I told him,

662
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,839
he's almost recovered.

663
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
I'll be back in a couple of days.

664
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,079
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

665
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,559
Why don't you stay in Shanghai

666
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,039
for a while.

667
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,799
I'm not used to living in Shanghai.

668
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,440
Let's go back.

669
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm homesick.

670
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,599
Good timing.

671
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,319
I'm going back.

672
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,519
Clear your room. Gu Qiao

673
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,480
is back from a business trip.

674
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,400
You don't have to be

675
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
in the same room.

676
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:51,839
Dad,

677
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,440
To be honest with you,

678
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,319
Gu Qiao didn't go on a business trip,

679
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,759
Some time ago,

680
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,400
the company fired her.

681
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,039
Because of this,

682
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,119
we had some conflicts,

683
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,400
But

684
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,039
now that it's all settled,

685
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,400
Gu Qiao has returned to the company.

686
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,039
Do you think if you don't tell me,

687
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,159
I won't feel it?

688
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
I knew it a long time ago.

689
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,159
She went back to the company?

690
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,639
Have you resolved your conflict?

691
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,639
I guess it's settled.

692
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,679
It's finally settled.

693
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,039
Then I have a few words to tell you.

694
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,519
Since you were little,

695
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,239
you've always been strong in character,

696
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,920
He refused to bow his head easily.

697
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,440
Where's Gu Qiao?

698
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,639
You grew up in such a family,

699
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
and now you're divorced.

700
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,280
You went to Shanghai alone.

701
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,840
It's not easy.

702
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,639
You two grew up together,

703
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,960
and you've been classmates for so many years,

704
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
Now in a company,

705
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,639
you're her leader.

706
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,119
Whether it's private

707
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
or public,

708
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
You should take care of her.

709
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Understand her more

710
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,119
and tolerate her more.

711
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,639
Since the conflict has been resolved,

712
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,760
you can persuade her

713
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,199
to move back.

714
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,599
You two

715
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,960
are helping each other.

716
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,360
I can rest assured.

717
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
Dad, I got it.

718
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,559
Get a blanket later.

719
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
Don't catch a cold when you sleep at night.

720
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,159
Drink ginger cola

721
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,079
while it's hot,

722
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,840
Warm your body.

723
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,800
Thank you.

724
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,719
How long have you been together?

725
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,360
It's been six years,

726
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,679
six years,

727
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,920
No wonder you're so close.

728
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:10,920
Honey,

729
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,480
what's wrong?

730
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,760
I ran out of shampoo.

731
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,920
We used it up at a discount.

732
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,519
We used it up.

733
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,760
I have it there.

734
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,679
I'll get it for you.

735
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,559
No, no, no.

736
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,360
It's okay.

737
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll mix it with water.

738
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,320
It can be used again.

739
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,239
When are you going to get married?

740
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,039
Save some more money.

741
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,039
When I've saved enough down payment,

742
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,880
I'll get married.

743
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,280
Let's stay in Shanghai

744
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,760
for years like ours.

745
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,960
Take your time.

746
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,239
I don't know

747
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,880
when there will be hope.

748
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,880
I'm ready. I can go with my shoes on.

749
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,920
Okay, I'm fine. Okay,

750
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,079
you can go now.

751
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,840
Are you going to the company dressed like this?

752
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,639
Can't I?

753
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,599
Actually, you don't have to dress up so delicately.

754
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,639
Why?

755
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,039
It's okay. Let's go out first.

756
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,599
You'll know later. Hurry up.

757
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,559
Hurry up.

758
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,960
There are a lot of people going to work this morning.

759
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,840
It's bad luck to be late. I'm telling you,

760
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,400
this isn't the place to go by bike.

761
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,559
It's two kilometers away from the bus stop.

762
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,039
Riding a bike is faster than walking. Scan it.

763
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,360
You don't have an app. I … I

764
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,840
… Next … Forget it. It's too late. You can

765
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,599
ride this one.

766
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,239
I happen to have two numbers. Hurry up.

767
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,440
Thank you.

768
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,360
You're welcome.

769
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,159
You know how to ride, right?

770
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:54,840
I know how to do it.

771
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,360
Let's go.

772
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,000
Hurry up.

773
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,519
Hurry up. Slow down.

774
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,039
This is it.

775
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,639
Here, here, here.

776
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,440
Hurry up. We can't go up.

777
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,760
Wait, I didn't take my bag.

778
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,159
I … I … I … I'm in a hurry. Let me go first.

779
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,400
Hurry up,

780
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,920
Gu Qiao. Why don't we wait for the next one?

781
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
It's too late. Hurry up.

782
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Don't push me.

783
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,239
Did you come up?

784
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,519
Coming up.

785
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Wang Mei, are you there?

786
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,039
I'm here. I'm here.

787
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,320
Sir, close the door.

788
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,119
Are you okay?

789
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,960
You do this every day at work,

790
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,800
just get used to it.

791
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,239
If you go to the bus station by bike,

792
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,719
you don't have to change trains on the way.

793
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,360
It's just that there are too many people.

794
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,400
Is it a bit too much? It's a lot, okay?

795
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,719
As long as you get used to it.

796
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,079
How's your hairstyle?

797
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,039
It's a little messy.

798
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,920
It's okay. It's not important. Let's go.

799
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,719
Are you going to the company like this?

800
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,760
Or what?

801
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,199
Follow me.

802
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:38,519
Slow down.

803
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,679
What are you doing now, Ancestor?

804
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,639
You'll know when you come.

805
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,119
How can you go to the office like this?

806
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,280
Sorry,

807
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
there are so many people here today.

808
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,719
Excuse me. Excuse me.

809
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,199
Got it. It's on the first floor. I'll be right there.

810
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,840
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

811
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,440
Isn't it easy?

812
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,599
Just get used to it.

813
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,480
If a foreigner wants to make a foothold in Shanghai,

814
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,840
he has to work harder than others.

815
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,440
Be careful.

816
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,440
There are seats available. Hurry up.

817
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,599
Hurry up.

818
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,639
You … You … You … It's a

819
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,280
bit messy here.

820
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,519
Do you think my hairpin looks good with this dress?

821
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,559
It looks good.

822
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,559
Hurry up.

823
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,320
Slow down!

824
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Wait for me! Wait for me!

825
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,119
Morning, Mr. Yuan,

826
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,079
Morning,

827
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,400
Morning

828
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,079
Remember to drink it on time twice a day.

829
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,679
The sun is so bright

830
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,679
today. Yes.

831
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,159
It's really hot.

832
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,360
We'll get going then.

833
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,639
I'm leaving.

834
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,280
Goodbye.

835
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,719
Uncle,

836
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,199
Gu Qiao,

837
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,800
Why are you here?

838
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,559
It's okay for me to stay at home.

839
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,239
I want to see

840
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:50,960
what kind of office building

841
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,039
you and Yuan Ge work in?

842
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,639
I didn't expect it to be so magnificent.

843
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,760
So imposing.

844
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,199
Ge Ge should still be working overtime.

845
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,559
How about I show you around?

846
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,039
No need.

847
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,639
I'm not looking for Yuan Ge,

848
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,400
I'm looking for you.

849
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
I won't affect you.

850
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
It won't affect you.

851
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,280
I'll get going then.

852
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,519
-You guys talk. -Bye, uncle.

853
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,000
Goodbye.

854
