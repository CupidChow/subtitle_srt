1
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,870
During this period of time,

2
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,150
you've worked so hard.

3
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,510
Especially Ge Zi

4
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,680
and Bingwen.

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,280
Actually, it's mainly Mr. Du,

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,070
and all of you who have worked hard.

7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,560
I ran away because of personal matters.

8
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
I've been delayed for a long time.

9
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,000
Ge Zi,

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
don't say that.

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,840
Your father is sick?

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,590
You still have to deal with all kinds of work,

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,040
which is actually not easy.

14
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,430
No wonder I asked you to sign it every time.

15
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,590
They all come and go in a hurry.

16
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,870
If I had known,

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
I would have gone straight to the hospital to find you.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,120
All right,

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,680
I'll leave it to Bingwen.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,870
Let me tell you,

21
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,520
Li Meng's follow-up publicity plan

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,750
and work plan,

23
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay,

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,030
Cosmetics is one of the fastest

25
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,910
growing taxonomies

26
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,870
in the market,

27
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,710
The vast area of confrontation in China.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,870
Mr. Du,

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,280
what is it?

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Mr. Zhang,

31
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,630
Mr. Du,

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,360
Tell me,

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,190
it's nothing,

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,960
I just want to give you a compliment.

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,560
Lee Hyun got on the hill

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
before Ya Hyun moved to China,

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,360
Your product department

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
is the core support.

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,710
During this period of time,

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,840
you've really worked hard.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,590
No, no, no.

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
This is what we should do.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Li Meng is getting bigger and stronger,

44
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,520
and we have the energy,

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,430
I heard from them,

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,910
you seem to be in love.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,030
Yes

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,360
Isn't there a rush at home?

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,310
Thinking of meeting the right one,

50
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,360
we can talk about it quickly,

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,870
The point is that you've met the right one.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Mr. Du can also meet someone suitable.

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,910
Mr. Du can't meet the right one.

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
You two can't be

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,470
so stiff all the time.

56
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,710
This is the company.

57
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
There are a lot of people talking,

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,680
but you two don't talk,

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
What will people think?

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,360
It's either about work,

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
or it's about love.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,190
Either way,

63
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,360
it's not good for both of you.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,240
I understand you,

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,150
but you feel wronged, too?

66
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,680
I feel like I didn't do anything wrong.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
But since you chose

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,280
to be with her,

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,590
You have to tolerate everything about her.

70
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,190
Independence is her strength,

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
but it's also her weakness,

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,120
You know her family's situation.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,430
All these years,

74
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,680
why didn't she fall in love?

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,120
And after she's been with you,

76
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,240
she's actually slowly changing.

77
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,560
So you need to give her

78
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,510
more time.

79
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,240
What is this?

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,630
Don't try to buy me off.

81
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,830
Reward,

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,830
Reward You've agreed

83
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,800
to cooperate with Guoman,

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,480
To be honest, I didn't expect

85
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,870
the invitation,

86
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going to attend this exchange meeting

87
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,800
on behalf of the company.

88
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,950
It's all bragging.

89
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,360
It has no practical significance.

90
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,270
It's mainly for you to learn more.

91
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,270
Thank you.

92
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,390
Do you remember

93
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,390
what I just said?

94
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,120
Remember,

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,190
go ahead.

96
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,120
Think about it.

97
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm leaving.

98
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,160
Come on,

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,390
Long time no see,

100
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,720
Miss Gu,

101
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,480
This is my card.

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,870
I hope we can cooperate more in the future.

103
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,160
Thank you.

104
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,750
Come on,

105
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,560
Happy cooperation.

106
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,190
Go ahead. Let's

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,000
go over there and have a look.

108
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,920
Let's go.

109
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,720
This wine is good.

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Long time no see.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,950
It's good.

112
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,630
Come on, let's have a drink.

113
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,240
Indeed,

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,190
get ready for the back,

115
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,430
Mr. Xiong.

116
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,040
Hello,

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Miss Gu,

118
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,360
Mr. Wang,

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,270
your name is too unfamiliar.

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,270
You're my brother.

121
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,950
Sister,

122
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,070
then my brother told me,

123
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,870
If anything happens to you in the future, tell me,

124
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,310
and I'll do my best.

125
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,270
Thank you, brother.

126
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,510
Sister,

127
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
you and Mr. Xiong are good friends,

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,950
You should have told me earlier,

129
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,240
otherwise I wouldn't

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,430
have been rude that day.

131
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,830
Mr. Xiong,

132
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,720
at the karaoke bar that day,

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,870
Mr. Xiong made a special call,

134
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,240
but you really don't show your face.

135
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,430
Come on,

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
I propose a toast to you.

137
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,870
Last time alone.

138
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,630
Go to our company,

139
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,390
right?

140
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
If you're busy,

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,510
I'll go there first.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Goodbye.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Gu Qiao.

144
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,680
You're here too.

145
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,270
What a coincidence.

146
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,830
What's wrong?

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,430
You don't look well.

148
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,720
Are you okay?

149
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,160
I guess he drank

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,070
a little too hard just now.

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Why don't you let the driver take you back first?

152
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,920
No, thanks, Mr. Xiong.

153
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,870
No matter where you are,

154
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,360
you have to rely on your own strength.

155
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,720
Playing tricks

156
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,600
is really useless.

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,430
Look at me,

158
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
look at me,

159
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,910
With his own strength,

160
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,870
he managed to get the cooperation

161
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,630
of the popular cartoonist Bai Xue,

162
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,200
Am I good?

163
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,910
What did you do on your own?

164
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,080
You don't know.

165
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,600
Could it be that Mr. Wang is cooperating with you?

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
Is it because of your professional ability?

167
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,720
How is your professional ability?

168
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Who in the whole company doesn't know?

169
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,600
Here,

170
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,510
No, thanks.

171
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,150
Actually, I think Mr. Du

172
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,480
is quite nice, right?

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,030
Why don't you

174
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,030
tell me?

175
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,360
You know his relationship with me.

176
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,150
There was one time,

178
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,960
I overheard you on the phone.

179
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,960
Didn't Mr. Du

180
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
come to the hospital later?

181
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,670
I saw the expression on his face.

182
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,120
It's basically confirmed.

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Thank you.

184
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,240
You didn't expose me on the spot,

185
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,240
but actually I can understand you.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
Because,

187
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,390
because I also have a girlfriend

188
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,510
for three years,

189
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,840
But about this,

190
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,360
I never mentioned it to my mom,

191
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,270
If my mom knew about her,

192
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,360
she would force me to get married

193
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,790
and have a baby right away.

194
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,630
But when it comes to marriage and children,

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,270
I haven't thought it through.

196
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,360
That's why my girlfriend

197
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,550
always quarrels with me because of this.

198
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,870
What are you going to do?

199
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,960
I haven't decided yet.

200
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,910
Let's take it one day at a time.

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
Sometimes I think,

202
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,670
I'd better not think about it.

203
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,390
Just run away from it.

204
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Actually, I feel

205
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,790
the same way as you do now.

206
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,790
Really?

207
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Yuan Ge,

208
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,910
sometimes I think,

209
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,840
To get to know you,

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
to be friends with you,

211
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,360
It's really an honor.

212
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,790
If I keep it to myself,

213
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,910
with a trusted friend,

214
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,790
We can have a good talk.

215
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,600
I feel

216
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
a lot more relaxed.

217
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,630
How about this

218
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,790
Let me know

219
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,080
if you're unhappy or upset

220
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,870
in the future,

221
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll keep it a secret for you.

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll be your tree hole.

223
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,390
Thank you.

224
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,320
Let me help you.

225
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't bother.

226
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
-Be careful. -I'll do it.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,910
You drank again.

228
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,320
I went to an exchange meeting,

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,150
You drank so much at the exchange meeting,

230
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,600
Ge Ge,

231
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Tell me,

232
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm

233
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
overestimating myself.

234
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,960
What happened?

235
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,600
Do you remember some time ago,

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,510
I bragged in front of you.

237
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,030
Did you say that I managed the comic book

238
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,720
with my own ability?

239
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,840
Didn't you get it done?

240
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,440
Do you know how to sign the contract?

241
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
How did you sign it?

242
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,270
I just found out today

243
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,670
that it's Mr. Wang,

244
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,960
For Xiong Qiming's sake,

245
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,550
he is willing to cooperate with me.

246
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,150
So,

247
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,720
Xiong Qiming helped you secretly.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,870
I don't know.

249
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,480
Mr. Wang told me.

250
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,480
I didn't ask him.

251
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,120
I don't want to ask.

252
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,200
Do you know

253
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
why Xiong Qiming helped you?

254
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,960
I don't know.

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,150
I don't want to know either.

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
Now, I just want to

257
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
rely on my own ability,

258
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
and start a career.

259
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,790
It seems Hao Shuai is right.

260
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,390
What is it?

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,030
Xiong Qiming likes you.

262
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,840
Gu Qiao,

263
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,030
Xiong Qiming is a businessman

264
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,670
who can't afford to benefit early,

265
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,320
He helped you so much.

266
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,150
Do you think

267
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,150
it's that simple?

268
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,120
As a tutor for his daughter,

269
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
you'd better quit.

270
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,750
Your current relationship with him,

271
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,270
is very dangerous.

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Enjoy your meal.

273
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,440
What's wrong?

274
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,600
Didn't you say you wanted to see me?

275
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,120
Actually, I've been

276
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,000
looking for a chance to thank you.

277
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,910
In my work,

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,510
you've been helping me a lot.

279
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,270
There are suggestions,

280
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,670
as you know,

281
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,910
I haven't been working in the past few years,

282
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
and this time I came back to Shanghai,

283
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,550
Start all over again.

284
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,510
A lot of people will look down on me,

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,320
and they will think,

286
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
I don't know how to do anything.

287
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,270
But the more they act like this,

288
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,320
the more I want to prove myself

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,390
by my own ability.

290
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,750
But I don't want

291
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,790
my own success.

292
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,750
I got it by taking a shortcut.

293
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,120
Because I know that

294
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,480
what you get by taking shortcuts,

295
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,270
I'll lose it one day.

296
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,960
You've always told me,

297
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,720
in the workplace,

298
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
Interpersonal relationships are very important.

299
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,870
I think you're right.

300
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
But I also know that

301
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,480
the exchange between people,

302
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,870
They should be equal.

303
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,750
No one

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,080
will be nice to

305
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
another unconditionally,

306
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,960
So,

307
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,150
I don't want to accept it anymore.

308
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,840
Any help other than

309
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,790
peer-to-peer conditions.

310
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,200
Okay,

311
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,200
The picturesque Mr. Wang and I

312
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,670
do know each other.

313
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,550
He did mention to me that

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,510
he was talking about cooperation with Shumei,

315
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,790
But

316
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,910
I just

317
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,120
called him.

318
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,320
I believe Mr. Wang will choose Shumei.

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,080
It's based on the consideration of the market,

320
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
and the recognition of your ability,

321
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,750
Miss Gu.

322
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,030
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

323
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Unconsciously helping,

324
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,510
but I know I'm at work,

325
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,600
There are still many shortcomings.

326
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,790
So I want to

327
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,440
put more time and energy

328
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,790
into my work.

329
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Maybe I don't have much time

330
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,790
to spend with Ling Ling.

331
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,390
Sorry.

332
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,480
Miss Gu,

333
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,960
if I contact you,

334
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,320
If something makes you uncomfortable,

335
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
I'll pay more attention to it in the future.

336
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,390
But Ling Ling really needs you.

337
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't worry,

338
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,400
I won't bother you anymore.

339
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,070
Sorry,

340
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,160
I have a meeting later.

341
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,880
Enjoy your meal.

342
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,270
I'll get going.

343
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,240
We haven't decided when we'll be discharged yet.

344
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,310
I'm recovering well.

345
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,440
Living in the hospital all the time makes me afraid that

346
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,270
something new will happen to me,

347
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,270
Dad,

348
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,240
Look, even the doctor said,

349
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,440
we need to observe it again,

350
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,030
There's no hurry for a few days.

351
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,960
There's no rush.

352
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,790
You paid the mortgage yourself,

353
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,480
and helped Gu Qiao pay 2 million yuan.

354
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,830
If I stay in the hospital for one day,

355
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,510
I'll spend a lot of money.

356
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,590
Dad,

357
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Don't worry about

358
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,000
the money.

359
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,270
Okay, I won't worry about it.

360
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,240
Yuan Ge,

361
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,310
I told you before,

362
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,880
About getting married,

363
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,790
you must be

364
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,830
under a lot of pressure.

365
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,440
No.

366
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,590
I regret it.

367
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,350
I shouldn't have told you this.

368
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,640
Dad,

369
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,880
I really didn't.

370
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
Actually,

371
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,400
I have a boyfriend.

372
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,350
You have a boyfriend?

373
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,920
Nonsense.

374
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,590
I don't believe it.

375
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,510
You just want me to be happy.

376
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,310
No,

377
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,110
Dad,

378
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,240
Sit down,

379
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,790
Let me tell you.

380
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,960
You really have a boyfriend?

381
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,590
You have a boyfriend?

382
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
Who is it?

383
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,590
Where is it?

384
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,720
Dad, calm down.

385
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,030
The doctor said,

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,350
the most important thing for you right now,

387
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,030
It's about keeping peace of mind,

388
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,070
not getting excited,

389
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,510
I'm happy that my daughter

390
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,000
has a boyfriend.

391
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,880
Tell me

392
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,310
He's from Shanghai.

393
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,070
I've been dating him for a while,

394
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,070
when he was on a business trip,

395
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,510
Your condition is unstable.

396
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,720
So I didn't tell you.

397
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,830
Oh,

398
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,200
I see. Your aunt Sun,

399
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,200
You want to set you up with Sun?

400
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,480
Every time you talk about it,

401
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,510
you don't pick on me,

402
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,440
It turns out you have a boyfriend,

403
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,160
so bring him here.

404
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Let me see him.

405
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,440
You've seen it before.

406
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,720
My colleague?

407
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,830
Your colleague?

408
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,830
I'll see

409
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,440
Who's your colleague?

410
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,110
It can't be the guy

411
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,000
who delivered the fruit basket last time.

412
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,030
It's him.

413
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,550
Yes.

414
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
You should give me some fresh air.

415
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,070
So I can talk to him more.

416
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Get to know him better.

417
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,160
Dad,

418
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,550
It's my fault.

419
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,880
I didn't handle it properly.

420
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,550
It's your fault.

421
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,880
You don't

422
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
discuss anything with me.

423
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,790
It's all my own decision,

424
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,680
and later I'll make the young man

425
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,240
think that I don't like him,

426
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,440
Actually, it's not that I don't like him.

427
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,000
He,

428
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,160
What does he look like?

429
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,550
I didn't see it clearly.

430
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,550
But,

431
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,550
but you're willing to take this step,

432
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm happy

433
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,720
to have a boyfriend.

434
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,750
When will you bring him here?

435
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,720
I'm officially meeting with him.

436
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
When he's not busy,

437
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,070
I'll bring him here.

438
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,510
Bring him here quickly.

439
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm in a hurry.

440
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,070
What's his last name?

441
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,160
His surname is Du.

442
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,270
His name is Du Bingwen.

443
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,790
Du Bingwen,

444
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,880
Du.

445
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,960
Hey,

446
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,750
Are you home?

447
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,440
What's up?

448
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,830
Mr. Du,

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
you're so angry.

450
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,790
This weekend,

451
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,790
if Mr. Yuan wants to talk about work,

452
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's talk about it on Monday.

453
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,510
I want to see you.

454
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,270
I said,

455
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,550
I want to see you.

456
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,350
Where are you?

457
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,310
Where are you?

458
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm at home.

459
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,000
See you later.

460
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,750
Why are you here?

461
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,880
What's up?

462
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,830
I have a feeling that

463
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,240
my cabbage

464
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,880
has been arched by pigs.

465
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,880
Don't say

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,200
you're a little proud,

467
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm going to take a shower.

468
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,110
Stop!

469
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,400
You're fine.

470
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,590
Do you want to explain it to me?

471
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,070
How is it going between you two?

472
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,310
I... I'll talk to you

473
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,640
when I'm free.

474
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm going to the hospital.

475
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,960
You came back to take a shower,

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,070
how

477
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,070
We need to save the water bill

478
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,510
for Second Brother Du's family.

479
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,270
There's a smell in this room,

480
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,550
the sour smell of love,

481
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,790
I like it.

482
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Ge Ge has made a lot of achievements.

483
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,790
Come on.

484
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,750
Let's take a picture.

485
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Let's go.

486
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,110
Shumei is really generous this time.

487
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,200
That's right. It's a big battle.

488
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
Look over there.

489
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,030
Mr. Fu,

490
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,000
in the company,

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,510
What is the core meaning of R

492
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,680
& D and the future

493
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,440
development plan?

494
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,510
The high-end skin care products

495
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,270
launched by our company

496

have been launched nationwide.

497
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
At the same time,

498
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
all the stores under the line

499
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,350
are carrying out simultaneous promotion activities.

500
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
As for the core meaning of Li Juncheng,

501
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,110
what about our company?

502
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,000
In fact, he has been working hard

503
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,720
to promote domestic products,

504
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
Open up a new world

505
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,640
of its own.

506
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,920
Thank you very much, Mr. Xiong,

507
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,400
for Li Meng's achievement.

508
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,440
For the next three years,

509
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,440
I wish you a happy cooperation.

510
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,640
Sure,

511
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,640
Sure

512
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,110
Is there any new trend

513
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,640
in Ya'an City recently?

514
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,640
Mr. Fu,

515
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,920
don't worry.

516
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,440
Li Meng's overall expansion this time,

517
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,720
to attack the market quickly,

518
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,000
Yahyun has backed away from difficulties.

519
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,030
He announced plans to

520
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,200
postpone his entry into China.

521
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,030
I'm sure.

522
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,000
They wanted to

523
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,310
talk about cooperation with us,

524
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,270
Now there's no movement at all.

525
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,350
I guess

526
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,310
it won't be long,

527
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,480
The headquarters will officially issue the official document.

528
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,110
Mr. Du from your company,

529
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,400
isn't he quite well-connected

530
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
in Ya'an City?

531
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,510
If Mr. Fu doesn't believe me,

532
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,110
maybe you can ask him,

533
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,830
Of course I believe you.

534
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,200
I just didn't expect

535
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,030
that

536
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,310
success would come so fast this time.

537
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,880
Yes,

538
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,030
Sometimes,

539
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,350
When it comes to business,

540
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,960
it's about timing.

541
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,830
It's just a small difference.

542
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,070
It's just a thousand miles away.

543
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,550
So,

544
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Mr. Fu is bold,

545
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,510
I'm totally convinced.

546
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,110
I really want to give Mr. Fu

547
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,830
a hand.

548
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
Send Li Yuan to a higher position.

549
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,880
Mr. Xiong, what you mean is.

550
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,000
The first step

551
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,510
is to monopolize the domestic market

552
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,160
of high-end skin care products,

553
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,510
The second step

554
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,680
is to go abroad,

555
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,790
In the international market,

556
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,310
in less than three years,

557
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,720
Shumei can be listed

558
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,000
in the United States.

559
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,160
Hello, Ling Ling,

560
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Gu Qiao,

561
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,160
Why haven't you come yet?

562
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,750
I've been waiting for you for over half an hour.

563
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,310
I'm coming.

564
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,030
He's downstairs.

565
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,510
Okay, okay.

566
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,310
Where's the little prince?

567
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,750
Come to the earth,

568
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,790
look at this picture,

569
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,830
No one is here.

570
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,000
What about here?

571
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,200
There is only a moon-white snake

572
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
surging in the sand.

573
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,030
And then he told the little prince,

574
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,270
"This is the desert. ",

575
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,070
Look at the desert.

576
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,270
It's yellow,

577
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,240
It's all sand.

578
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,790
What did Snake say?

579
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,590
Miss Gu,

580
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,400
lunch is ready,

581
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,310
Let's go downstairs and eat.

582
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,110
Ling Ling, it's time to eat.

583
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,030
Ling Ling,

584
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,310
let's go eat first.

585
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,400
I'll come up

586
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
and read you a story later, okay?

587
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,680
Okay,

588
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,310
Let's go then.

589
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,550
Come on,

590
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Good boy.

591
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
Let's go.

592
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,880
Hold hands.

593
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,110
Where's Dad?

594
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Why isn't Dad here for dinner?

595
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,070
Dad said he still has things to deal with.

596
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,960
Ling Ling and Miss Gu eat first,

597
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,590
okay?

598
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay,

599
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Good boy.

600
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,440
Come on, Lingling,

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
eat more vegetables,

602
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,350
Thank you.

603
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,640
What's wrong with you?

604
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,030
Are you in a bad mood,

605
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,350
or are you having problems at work?

606
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,200
Didn't Xiong Qiming

607
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,880
help me

608
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,960
with Mr. Wang's matter last time?

609
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,440
I just talked to him,

610
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
and since that time,

611
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,030
He's been avoiding me.

612
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,960
But the more he acts like this,

613
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,960
the more unnatural I am.

614
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,750
Tell me,

615
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,270
did I go too far?

616
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,920
Actually, he was kind enough to help me,

617
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,400
so I don't think you did anything wrong.

618
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,640
Now that you've figured out

619
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
how to handle your relationship with him.

620
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,960
Just get straight to the point.

621
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,110
It's good for both of us.

622
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,440
Actually,

623
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,790
I should ask Gezi to handle this matter.

624
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,830
But she's busy on both sides now,

625
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,070
so I remember the last time Zhou Shan went on a business trip,

626
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,480
You're with her.

627
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,790
I think you're familiar with it, too.

628
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,640
So I'm not going to tell Gezi,

629
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,070
what's going on?

630
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,880
The thing about Zhoushan

631
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,830
selling fake goods last time,

632
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,270
When it's done,

633
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,030
what about over there,

634
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,830
Some of them

635
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,070
made an appointment with our opposite home,

636
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,720
It's not just that.

637
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
They are still inciting

638
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,070
the consumers who bought fake goods last time,

639
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,310
She said

640
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,720
Shumei was the one who stole it,

641
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,440
Selling fakes,

642
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
of course, the point is,

643
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,960
He knows that during this period of time,

644
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
all our energy

645
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,400
has been focused on Li Jingzhi

646
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
and many dealers

647
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,160
have gradually lost confidence in us.

648
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,160
He even terminated his contract with us.

649
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,550
We have to let them regain their confidence.

650
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,400
Let them know,

651
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,750
no matter how big it is,

652
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,480
We won't give up.

653
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,590
Shumei's original market,

654
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,960
what suggestions do you have?

655
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,200
Let Li Meng get back on track,

656
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,550
indeed we have to try our best

657
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,400
to deal with Shumei's market problems.

658
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,550
Gu Qiao just talked about the next one,

659
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,440
cooperation between China and Manchuria,

660
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,830
Originally we just wanted to do online promotion,

661
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,790
but now we can also do it offline,

662
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,720
It's also developing.

663
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
Invite all the friends

664
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
who are interested in Chinese comics

665
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,680
to join us.

666
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,720
And then provide them with

667
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,310
a variety of interactive games,

668
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,960
Cultural exchange venues,

669
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,680
snacks and so on.

670
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,880
Actually,

671
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,830
there's only one brand.

672
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,350
You need a long-term investment.

673
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,070
But we have a lot to think about.

674
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,150
We need to find a venue.

675
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,030
If you need to find a lot of people to attend the event,

676
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,920
you must have the money.

677
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,360
Think about the good food

678
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,320
and the good food,

679
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,800
But will you remember

680
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,840
Shumei in the end?

681
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,480
Maybe she's making

682
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,230
wedding dresses for others.

683
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,710
What's more,

684
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,960
if we need to mobilize this fund,

685
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,000
It's also a problem.

686
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
As you know,

687
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,630
even if the situation in Li Mansion

688
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,880
is so good now,

689
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,320
But we have to open stores

690
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,590
in so many places across the country,

691
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,800
You know

692
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,440
how devoted you are.

693
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,800
I will control the budget.

694
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
And we have reached

695
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,360
a long-term cooperation with Guangke,

696
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,630
When we're doing the event,

697
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,550
they should show some sincerity.

698
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,360
If Guangke can follow up,

699
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
of course it will be the best.

700
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,920
Otherwise, even if it's a great idea,

701
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,110
the publicity can't keep up.

702
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,920
Our money is wasted.

703
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,760
Got it.

704
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,960
As for the marketing campaign of Guoman that you're in charge of,

705
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Mr. Fu has agreed to expand the scale,

706
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,070
Aren't you happy about that?

707
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,030
Happy is happy,

708
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,000
but the budget is so low,

709
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,150
What should I do?

710
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,550
Besides, those people from Guangke

711
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,960
are not easy to use.

712
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,590
You're so smart and capable,

713
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,840
there must be a way to convince them.

714
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,760
Time is running out. We need to work hard.

715
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,070
Uncle,

716
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,920
it's your turn.

717
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,710
You're gone,

718
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,070
Let's go.

719
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,960
Do you have something on your mind?

720
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,760
No.

721
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,320
Yuan Ge's boyfriend will come later

722
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
Boyfriend?

723
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,070
Well,

724
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,070
The colleague who came last time.

725
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,230
Sun Bin,

726
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,630
why are you still playing chess?

727
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
Ask Yuan

728
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,150
to dress up and dress up,

729
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,110
Let's go. The air is so bad.

730
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,550
I'm so bored.

731
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,320
Come on. Let's go out for a walk.

732
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,110
I'm almost done.

733
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,110
You see, people come and go here

734
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,920
every day,

735
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,550
It's like a trotting horse lantern.

736
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,590
I'm sorry, Uncle,

737
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,400
Sun,

738
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,150
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

739
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,280
You're a good kid.

740
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,920
I wanted you and Yuan Ge to be together,

741
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
but maybe it wasn't fate enough.

742
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,550
Uncle, please don't say that.

743
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,590
Yuan Ge and I

744
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,840
are just friends.

745
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
I played chess with you

746
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,710
because we hit it off.

747
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,190
It really has nothing to do with Yuan Ge.

748
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,190
You're such a sensible child.

749
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
If you put it that way,

750
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,480
Me,

751
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,440
I feel much more at ease now.

752
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,230
What are you still dawdling about there?

753
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,440
Is it useful for you to dawdle?

754
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,840
Hurry up!

755
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,110
Take mom's clothes.

756
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,880
Hurry up!

757
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,590
Come on!

758
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,280
Go! Go! Go!

759
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,510
Do you want me to carry it for you?

761
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,150
No, no, no.

762
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,590
I can handle it.

763
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,510
Look how nervous you are.

764
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,070
I'm not nervous.

765
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,190
You're sweating.

766
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,670
I'm not.

767
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,110
Don't talk nonsense.

768
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm afraid the soup

769
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,280
will get cold. It's okay.

770
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,070
My dad is very nice.

771
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,630
Really?

772
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,320
Really?

773
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,190
Sun Bin,

774
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,030
Auntie

775
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,230
is so quick.

776
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,590
The soup is getting cold.

777
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,630
Hurry up.

778
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,190
Did you see that?

779
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
Are you silly?

780
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,400
You're doing filial duty for her.

781
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,000
Is she flirting there?

782
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,920
Mom, what are you talking about?

783
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,030
I'm not talking nonsense.

784
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,230
Did you see it?

785
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,510
You even have a boyfriend.

786
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,280
She's still doing Tai Chi with me,

787
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,150
she just wants to be a free nurse.

788
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm telling you,

789
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Dad,

790
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,150
-Here you are. -Hello,

791
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,670
uncle.

792
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,670
My name is Du Bingwen.

793
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,280
Hello, Du,

794
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,630
Dad,

795
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,760
Du

796
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,000
made this soup

797
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,280
specially for you. Be careful.

798
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,480
You know how to cook?

799
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,920
It's so rare.

800
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,710
These are flowers for you.

801
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,710
You even sent me flowers.

802
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,840
Thank you, Du.

803
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,030
Dad,

804
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,320
Why don't you guys talk?

805
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm going to fetch some water.

806
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,190
Okay.

807
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,320
Have a seat.

808
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,550
It's okay, uncle.

809
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,280
I can just stand here.

810
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,150
Okay. Stand there.

811
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,840
Du,

812
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,030
I should apologize to you.

813
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,670
Last time,

814
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,840
Yuan Ge didn't tell me beforehand,

815
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,150
I know nothing.

816
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,800
So I let you go back.

817
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm sorry.

818
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,230
No, uncle,

819
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,400
Yes, it's my fault.

820
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,440
Because Yuan Ge is afraid of affecting my work,

821
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,150
I've been away on business,

822
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,070
She didn't tell me.

823
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,000
When I came back,

824
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,230
I found out that you were hospitalized,

825
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,510
I came here as soon as possible.

826
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,710
I didn't tell Yuan Ge,

827
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,760
he came here in the first place

828
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
and cared so much about me.

829
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,400
It means you care about my daughter.

830
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,360
I'm happy.

831
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,630
Have a seat.

832
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,070
Du,

833
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,030
sit down. Don't be nervous.

834
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,550
I … I'm not nervous.

835
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,070
Du,

836
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,920
about you and Yuan Ge,

837
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,510
Do you have any plans?

838
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,630
plan

839
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,440
Beat him,

840
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,630
What do you mean?

841
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,880
Let me put it bluntly,

842
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,590
have you discussed about

843
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,840
getting married and starting a family in private?

844
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,630
No.

845
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,480
We're still young,

846
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,960
and we want to focus on our careers first,

847
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,840
When our career becomes more stable,

848
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,400
we'll consider getting married.

849
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,190
I heard that your parents are abroad.

850
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,710
Yes.

851
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,710
Do they know

852
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,760
about you and Yuan Ge?

853
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,400
I know.

854
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,190
What's their attitude?

855
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,480
They don't care about anything.

856
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,400
Listen to us.

857
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I'm sorry,

858
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,590
whether it's the cost or the schedule,
