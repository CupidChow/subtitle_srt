1
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,840
Miss Gu, you're here.

2
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,039
She should be Mrs. Luan now.

3
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,719
Mrs. Luan, please come in.

4
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,599
Mrs. Luan,

5
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,719
according to your preference,

6
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,159
We've already picked out new seasonal products,

7
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
and we're still following the usual rules,

8
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Try on the clothes before you look at the jewelry.

9
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,840
This way, please.

10
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,199
A good shot

11
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,080
depends mainly on

12
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,879
the waist strength,

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
As a man,

14
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,919
the most important thing is to have a good waist.

15
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,479
Mr. Chen,

16
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,680
don't joke around.

17
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
Come on. Try it.

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,719
Me,

19
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,439
I don't know how to do it.

20
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,280
-Let me teach you. -Come on. I can't play

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,919
well.

22
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,719
Don't laugh at me.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,080
No, I won't.

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,919
Come on,

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
clasp your thumb.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,639
Fasten your thumb.

27
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,039
How about this?

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,039
That's right.

29
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,319
Keep your legs apart

30
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,759
and bend your knees.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
Bend it slightly.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,479
Straight waist,

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,840
the most important thing is to use waist strength,

34
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,639
Okay,

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,960
One,

36
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,120
Two.

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,919
It's okay.

38
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,120
How about another one?

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Forget it.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,639
I really don't know how to do it.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,800
Mr. Yuan,

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,599
come and have fun.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Forget it.

44
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,080
I heard that Mr. Yuan

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,560
is going to be promoted to vice president soon.

46
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,560
Don't tell me you're putting on airs

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
in front of me.

48
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,360
You don't give me face at all.

49
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,240
Looks like I'm the one who disappointed you.

50
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,439
That's right.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
We won't talk about work today,

52
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,120
As human beings,

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,759
the most important thing is to be happy.

54
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,400
-Kaixin. -Kaixin.

55
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,199
Come on.

56
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,919
Mr. Yuan,

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
what are you doing?

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,159
I don't want to talk about work.

59
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,879
Why am I here?

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,560
What does it have to do with me if you're happy or not?

61
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,879
Yanxi,

62
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,319
let's go. Goodbye, Mr. Chen.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,400
Hey,

64
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,199
why are you like this?

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
Is there anyone who talks about business like you?

66
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,839
Are you going to do this business or not?

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Come back!

68
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,399
Come back.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,399
Master said one thing,

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
when you threw the pole,

71
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,160
So cool!

72
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,199
Actually, Mr. Chen,

73
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,439
he is famous for

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,560
having a bad heart but not a bad heart,

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,800
How dare you touch your hands

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
and pinch your waist.

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
Take advantage of me?

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,600
But you just threw it away.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,319
Our contract,

80
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,800
I guess, also flew away.

81
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,319
If not,

82
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,639
he won't sign it yet.

83
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,920
I sent someone to inquire about

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
their company's financial situation

85
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,600
is very bad.

86
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,560
In this case,

87
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,480
he only cares about

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
eating, drinking and having fun every day.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
Obviously, he's just acting

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,199
and trying to raise the price.

91
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,680
You've done your research.

92
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,720
I'll go back and prepare the contract.

93
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,720
No rush.

94
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
Wait for the other party to take the initiative to call,

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,439
and then take the opportunity to lower the price,

96
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,279
This suit fits well, too.

97
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,120
When Li Li wears it,

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,839
she looks

99
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,600
different.

100
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,920
Mrs. Luan,

101
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,560
I think this outfit

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
is perfect for a honeymoon trip.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
It's simple and stylish.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,839
What do you think?

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,959
Let's take a look.

106
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,120
Turn around.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Not so good.

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
It doesn't matter.

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,439
What have you tried just now?

110
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,360
I'll pack it for you.

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,839
She doesn't want anything she tried.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,720
Wrap the rest up for me.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,120
Okay,

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's go

115
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,560
As for the whole wedding process today,

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,199
you need to familiarize yourself with it.

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
My sister is getting married today,

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
so I prepared a red envelope for her,

119
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,000
Keep it.

120
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,680
When your sister gets married,

121
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,639
why do you give her a red envelope?

122
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Keep the money for your wedding.

123
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,639
Got it?

124
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,759
If a child is sensible,

125
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,959
he can't be sensible here.

126
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Welcome. Welcome.

127
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
Come in, please.

128
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,519
Hello,

129
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,240
please come in.

130
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Okay, okay,

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,560
In-laws.

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,480
Dad, Mom,

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,079
Gu Liang, you're here.

134
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,240
Mother, brother-in-law,

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,800
In-laws.

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,279
My son is so handsome today.

137
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,680
Auntie, right?

138
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,720
Auntie only has this temperament of yours.

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,079
That's why I can control this suit.

140
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,360
My in-laws'suit is not bad either.

141
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,839
Sis,

142
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,560
Your daughter-in-law is so sweet-tongued,

143
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,480
I think she's with her in-laws.

144
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,240
Does sweet talk work?

145
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,079
Women still have to learn to be

146
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,639
husband and son and be filial to their in-laws,

147
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
Xiao Yu,

148
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,720
after we get married,

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,759
When you have a mother-in-law,

150
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,040
don't forget to be filial

151
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,399
to your mother-in-law.

152
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,720
Auntie, don't worry.

153
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Hyo-byeok,

154
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,240
Be dutiful

155
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,480
to your parents.

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
Let's go. I'll take you in first.

157
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,279
We'll go in first.

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,319
Over there is the auditorium,

159
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,759
Let's go.

160
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,279
Yuan,

161
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,000
does Yuan Ge have a date?

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,839
No.

163
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,279
That's good.

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
I have a nephew

165
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,920
who graduated from a prestigious university.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,160
Working in a state-owned enterprise,

167
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,000
I think they're perfect for each other.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Dad,

169
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,519
Aunt Fang,

170
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Yuan Ge is back.

171
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,639
I thought you wouldn't be able to make it back.

172
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,279
You're back, aren't you?

173
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,759
I'll go in and see Gu Qiao first.

174
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,519
-Okay. -You go first.

175
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,759
Girl,

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,199
A woman changes eighteen times before reaching womanhood.

177
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,439
You're getting prettier.

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Master,

179
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,240
as you expected,

180
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,439
Mr. Chen,

181
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,680
this morning, early in the morning,

182
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,439
So he came to our company

183
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,399
with the official seal in a hurry.

184
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,120
Okay, I see.

185
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,800
How is it? Do you like it?

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,360
Yes,

187
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,560
I still remember,

188
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,040
When I graduated from primary school,

189
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,959
I played Snow White,

190
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,680
Back then, you made up

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
my crown for me.

192
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,879
At that time, you were still ugly,

193
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,919
so you wanted to stop acting.

194
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,120
At that time, I said,

195
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,759
when you get married,

196
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,279
I'll give you

197
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,960
a shiny real crown,

198
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,080
But this diamond isn't real.

199
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
It's crystal.

200
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,159
Ge Ge,

201
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,240
you're the best to me.

202
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,360
He never lied to me.

203
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,399
Didn't you always want to wear

204
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,440
a western wedding dress for your wedding?

205
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,200
Why is it Chinese?

206
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,200
My mother-in-law chose it.

207
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,759
It's too much trouble to prepare the wedding by yourself.

208
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm too lazy to do it.

209
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,120
Gu Qiao

210
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,799
Do you have something on your mind?

211
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,519
There is indeed.

212
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,039
What's wrong?

213
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
It must be premarital anxiety disorder.

214
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,879
But you're here.

215
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,639
I'll be fine, won't I?

216
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,440
All right. Dear leaders,

217
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,759
the father of our bride may be too excited.

218
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,559
He bowed to everyone at the scene.

219
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,600
What's going on?

220
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,519
It's okay. It's okay. Don't be careful.

221
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,440
Dear leaders,

222
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,679
you made a fool of yourself,

223
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,039
you're inexperienced for the first time.

225
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,360
Do you want a second chance?

226
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a happy day, I'm sorry

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
I made a mistake.

228
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,919
Our bridegroom has a successful career.

229
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,480
What happened?

230
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
The bride is as beautiful as a flower.

231
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,559
They have gone through

232
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,279
a sweet love journey together for several years,

233
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,519
So today, from here,

234
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,919
we will witness them

235
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,240
start another new stage in their lives.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,159
First,

237
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,559
the bride and groom exchange wedding rings.

238
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,080
Okay, bridegroom, please wait a moment.

239
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Before that,

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
please say your declaration of love to the bride out loud.

241
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
Qiao,

242
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,120
ever since you promised me,

243
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,759
The moment he came back to his hometown with me,

244
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,759
I knew it.

245
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,240
You're the only one in my life,

246
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,919
time flies,

247
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
My love for you

248
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,960
has never changed.

249
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,360
From now on, every day,

250
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,000
I will be by your side.

251
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
I will protect you

252
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,559
with my whole life,

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
To fulfill

254
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,240
my promise of love to you,

255
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,200
Qiao Qiao,

256
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,559
please trust me.

257
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,600
Me,

258
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,000
Luan Yu

259
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
will give you happiness for the rest of your life.

260
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,600
Mrs. Luan,

261
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,879
these cufflinks are new this year,

262
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,960
This is the only model in the city.

263
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,480
The hottest male star of the year,

264
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,759
Levi's also wore it.

265
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,600
I'm sure

266
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
your husband will like it.

267
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
There are some things

268
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,399
that my husband will find fresh.

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
It's not that if you think he likes it,

270
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,960
he really likes

271
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,799
luxury goods. You don't understand,

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,360
Men,

273
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,279
you don't understand.

274
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
So,

275
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
do your job as a salesperson.

276
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,440
Don't talk, be vain, and be delusional,

277
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,960
understand?

278
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,440
I hope you really understand

279
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,679
what I'm saying.

280
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,679
Qiao Qiao

281
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
Really?

282
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,480
Every day,

283
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Yes.

284
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,480
Every day,

285
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,840
no, no,

286
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,600
Every moment,

287
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,159
every minute,

288
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,639
Every second.

289
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,399
Who gave it to you?

290
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Cufflinks?

291
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
What cufflinks?

292
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,440
A friend gave it to me.

293
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,559
Which friend?

294
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,080
Just

295
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,919
Well,

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,240
Shishitou,

297
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,159
I'll keep asking.

298
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,519
Do you want to say that

299
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,360
Stone's lover is Li Li,

300
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,159
Li Li, who is it?

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,000
Li Li.

302
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,000
Well.

303
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,559
This is Li Li, right?

304
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,399
It's her.

305
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,360
This is Li Li.

306
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,720
Hello, honey.

307
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
What are you doing?

308
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,200
He hasn't been with me these days.

309
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,480
I can't even fall asleep.

310
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,759
Let me

311
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,039
pick you up.

312
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,080
How can I do that?

313
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,360
Before we get married,

314
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,000
we can't sleep together.

315
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
No, I don't.

316
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,480
I can't sleep without you.

317
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,120
I can't fall asleep either.

318
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,759
But we can be together

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,879
every day after we get married, right?

320
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,679
Honey,

321
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,480
why do you think I love you so much?

322
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,079
I feel like,

323
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm better than when we first got together,

324
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,000
I love you even more.

325
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm so looking forward to it.

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,119
When we get married tomorrow,

327
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
you put on a beautiful wedding dress,

328
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Standing in front of me,

329
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,119
you must be the most beautiful bride

330
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,279
in the world.

331
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,079
Hey,

332
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,799
Honey,

333
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,440
can you hear me?

334
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,160
Hello.

335
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,119
Qiao Qiao

336
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,720
It's not what you think.

337
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,920
I'll explain it to you

338
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,720
when we get home.

339
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,559
It's a wedding now.

340
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,799
Let's put on the ring.

341
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,440
When we get back,

342
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,400
I'll talk to you.

343
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:42,599
Come on,

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,759
Luan Yu,

345
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,920
you told me.

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,720
You want me to go home with you.

347
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,359
You will love me for the rest of your life.

348
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,559
I believe it.

349
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,039
When I found out

350
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,319
about you two,

351
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,759
I think,

352
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,240
I think

353
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,720
you were bewitched for a while.

354
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:12,640
You,

355
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,519
You're just

356
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,000
trying to feel fresh.

357
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,559
I think,

358
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,279
as long as I give you one more chance,

359
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,680
We can start from scratch.

360
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm lucky

361
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,279
that you love me in your heart,

362
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,039
Qiao Qiao,

363
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,839
but now,

364
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,799
I don't know at all.

365
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,519
Which one of your words is true?

366
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,279
Qiao Qiao

367
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,240
This is really

368
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,880
not what you think.

369
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,559
How about this,

370
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,079
Sis,

371
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,519
When we get home,

372
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,480
I'll explain it to you.

373
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Let's put the ring on first.

374
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,880
Okay?

375
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Gu Qiao

376
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
You need time to be

377
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,240
willful. What's the occasion now?

378
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,839
Hurry up and finish the process.

379
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,799
Let's talk about it when we get home.

380
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,359
Mom, what are you afraid of?

381
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,160
Me

382
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,440
Do you think our small family

383
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,440
will embarrass your Luan family?

384
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,640
Or are you afraid that I'll tell everyone,

385
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,319
that your son is getting a license with me,

386
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,680
In less than a month,

387
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,599
you were fooling around with another woman

388
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,480
on my wedding bed.

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,559
What?

390
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,640
Is there such a thing?

391
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,759
I just can't believe it.

392
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,839
How could it be like that?

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,240
Don't talk nonsense.

394
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,079
Shut up!

395
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,720
What's going on?

396
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,200
If you still want to go to Luan's house,

397
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,200
stop messing around.

398
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,880
Why did you go home with my son?

399
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,759
Don't you know?

400
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,519
Mom,

401
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,480
Shut up!

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Shut up.

403
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
Qiao Qiao,

404
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,640
listen to me,

405
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,960
Put the ring on first.

406
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,799
When you go back,

407
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,119
you can beat and scold me as you like

408
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:27,559
Come on,

409
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,359
I should have done something earlier.

410
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,759
You haven't had enough fun, have you?

411
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Why are you taking me so long?

412
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,400
Don't talk nonsense.

413
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,160
How could you hit someone?

414
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,279
You're bullying me.

415
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,319
How did you hit my son?

416
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
Why should I hit her?

417
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,160
What's wrong?

418
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,079
You can't hit him either.

419
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,920
Sister, I'm coming.

420
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,319
Stop it!

421
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,400
You even hit me,

422
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,759
Qiao Qiao,

423
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,599
Who are you to her?

424
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,039
Qiao Qiao,

425
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,160
I raised such a big son,

426
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
Why did you hit my sister?

427
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,880
You didn't even hit her.

428
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,640
How dare you hit my son?

429
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
Go upstairs now.

430
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,759
Try to persuade you

431
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,519
to marry my son,

432
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,039
Stop fighting!

433
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,359
You are Pangaozhi.

434
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,079
Like my best friend,

435
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,359
I'll go shopping and eat with you,

436
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,200
I'll take care of you

437
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,839
like a father.

438
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,680
I'll make you happy like a son.

439
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,519
Gu Qiao, promise me.

440
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,960
Promise him, promise him, promise him.

441
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,240
Promise him

442
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,799
to wait for me in the car.

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,519
Our shoes are made of handmade cloth,

444
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,880
which is very comfortable to wear when driving,

445
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:58,960
How much is this pair?

446
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,839
298.

447
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,079
Then wrap it up for me. Thank you.

448
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,920
Okay.

449
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,359
Everyone thought

450
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,039
I would be happy if I married Luan Yu.

451
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,079
I have no worries about food and clothing.

452
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,720
But how am I doing?

453
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,559
Only you know it.

454
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,759
I live in Luan's house,

455
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,119
and I'm very careful every day.

456
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,839
I dare not talk much.

457
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,279
I was afraid that I was wrong.

458
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,559
Make his mother unhappy,

459
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,279
every time you call me and ask me,

460
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,359
How are you doing in Luan's house?

461
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,720
I was lying to you.

462
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,359
If the Luan family treats you like this,

463
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,680
why do they still want the wedding to continue?

464
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,759
I used to think,

465
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,119
as long as Luan Yu treats me well,

466
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,359
It's good for my family.

467
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,319
How can I be wronged like this?

468
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,079
And as you know,

469
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,680
I came home with him after graduation,

470
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,200
I've never worked before.

471
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,359
To put it bluntly,

472
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,240
I'm just not independent enough.

473
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,559
Now that it has happened.

474
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,319
Come back to Shanghai with me first.

475
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,759
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

476
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,880
I bought you some

477
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,319
quick-frozen dumplings and dumplings,

478
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
If you're hungry,

479
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
cook some yourself.

480
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
That's all you usually eat?

481
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,160
I usually order takeout.

482
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,240
By the way,

483
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,920
I have to go to the company early today.

484
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,039
I'll take you to dinner

485
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,759
after work.

486
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,799
Home Wi-Fi,

487
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,799
I sent it to your phone.

488
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,759
This is your medical report.

489
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,839
Take a look.

490
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,039
Doctor,

491
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,799
this is early-onset,

492
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,960
What does ovarian

493
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
insufficiency mean?

494
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,200
Early-onset

495
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,480
ovarian dysfunction,

496
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
Commonly known as premature ovarian failure,

497
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,319
the clinical manifestation is

498
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,400
secondary amenorrhea.

499
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
And infertility.

500
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,319
What is the cause?

501
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,440
The exact cause is still unknown.

502
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
But according to the survey data

503
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,720
in recent years,

504
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,480
Most of these patients are concentrated

505
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
in first-tier cities in China,

506
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,599
Especially in various high-pressure industries,

507
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,400
it can be said that it is

508
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
an increasingly common occupational female disease,

509
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,400
You haven't menstruated

510
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,319
for six months, right?

511
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,680
How?

512
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,160
Right now,

513
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,319
there is no medical cure

514
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,559
for this disease.

515
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,279
Estrogen is low?

516
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,240
is the main cause

517
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,400
of menstrual disorders

518
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,440
in women,

519
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,480
So I will prescribe some drugs

520
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
to stimulate estrogen secretion

521
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,759
in your body,

522
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,559
Medicine,

523
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,839
You have to keep eating.

524
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,680
But if you

525
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,599
really have a heart disease,

526
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,640
You can't completely rely

527
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,119
on drugs,

528
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,319
You should also consciously maintain

529
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,160
a healthy eating habit,

530
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,079
For example,

531
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,640
you can eat more bean products.

532
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,599
At the same time, we should have

533
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,960
a good exercise routine,

534
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,039
Learn to channel your emotions.

535
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,039
One more thing,

536
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,200
I want to remind you that

537
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,720
the effect of dating

538
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,039
is the most immediate.

539
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,359
Thank you, doctor.

540
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,119
Okay.

541
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,079
Honey,

542
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,079
are you ready?

543
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
My palanquin

544
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,880
will be here soon.

545
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,400
Hello, Mom,

546
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,279
Gu Qiao,

547
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
I think,

548
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,279
I don't have the ability

549
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,359
to support a girl like you anymore.

550
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,079
Therefore,

551
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,839
you should stop calling me mom.

552
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,200
Then why did you call me?

553
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,279
Why should I question you?

554
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,880
You turned around and ran away yesterday.

555
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,160
You're free now.

556
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,759
Have you ever thought of your father and me?

557
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
We're just about to be skinned

558
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,359
by the Luan family's cramp, you know?

559
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you all right?

560
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,079
Now you want to ask us?

561
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Where are you?

562
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,880
Shanghai

563
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,160
-Come back. -Come back. Come back.

564
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,720
Miss,

565
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,880
Yesterday, your father and I

566
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,079
were lying to

567
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,319
the Luan family.

568
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,559
All good things

569
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,920
to say. All right,

570
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,319
The Luan family agreed,

571
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,440
saying no problem.

572
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,240
As a young man,

573
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,039
there are times when he can't carry it clearly,

574
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,160
As long as you are willing to come back,

575
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
bow your head and admit your mistake,

576
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,279
This matter will be over.

577
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,200
Admit your mistake?

578
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,480
Why should I admit my mistake?

579
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,799
I didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,759
Why?

581
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,680
You and Luan Yu

582
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,799
have already got a marriage certificate.

583
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,039
You're a couple now.

584
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,400
Why do you think so?

585
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,799
Can't I afford nine yuan

586
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,079
for a divorce certificate?

587
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,559
Gu Qiao

588
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,960
Then I think your brain

589
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,119
is really burning up

590
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,759
a little girl like you,

591
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,440
It doesn't matter

592
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,680
if you come or not.

593
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,599
The Luan family is so well-off,

594
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
even if we get divorced,

595
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,920
How can you find

596
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,039
a young and beautiful girl

597
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,039
by backhand?

598
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,119
What about you?

599
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,319
Then I'll introduce you to him.

600
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,960
You're already married.

601
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,759
You know what?

602
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,839
And because of what you did,

603
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,799
yesterday, the whole city was full of wind and rain.

604
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,960
Do you think you can still get married?

605
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,599
Are you still my mom?

606
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
Don't worry about it, okay?

607
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,279
Come back now.

608
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,920
Come back, come back, okay?

609
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,440
No, I won't.

610
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,920
If you want to go, go by yourself.

611
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Mr. Du,

612
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,319
based on your qualifications,

613
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I helped you sort out

614
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,599
the positions of these companies,

615
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,680
They are the most powerful companies

616
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,839
in the industry.

617
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:46,960
And now

618
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,400
there are positions that suit you.

619
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,200
No need to look at it.

620
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,359
I want to go to Shumei.

621
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,880
Shu Mei,

622
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,480
these companies

623
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,720
are bigger than Shu Mei.

624
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,640
And Shumei

625
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,319
only recruits brand directors now,

626
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,519
With your qualifications,

627
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,440
you can be qualified

628
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,400
for a higher position.

629
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
It's okay. Please contact me.

630
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,440
Okay.

631
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,880
-Hello. -Your lemonade. Thank

632
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,759
you.

633
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,880
Enjoy your meal.

634
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,000
Ge Ge

635
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,039
-It's yours. -Hello.

636
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,039
Who is it?

637
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,279
Thank you. No need.

638
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,920
You've been staring at your phone

639
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
since you were in Shanghai.

640
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Are you waiting for him?

641
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,119
Do you think

642
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,559
he's

643
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,800
on his way to me,

644
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,840
Something happened.

645
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,880
Didn't I

646
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,079
call you?

647
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,719
If there's an accident,

648
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,239
I'll tell you first.

649
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,440
It must be that

650
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
his mother confiscated his phone.

651
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,280
You keep doing this,

652
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,039
Gu Qiao,

653
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,960
It's easy for him

654
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
to buy a new phone.

655
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,880
Luan Yu is very dutiful

656
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,159
to his mother and put him alone,

657
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
You still can't let him go.

658
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,119
You know what?

659
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,199
As long as I'm free these two days,

660
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,000
all I can think about is him.

661
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,079
Gu Qiao,

662
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,480
things have come to this.

663
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,280
What you need most now

664
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,400
is rational thinking,

665
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,079
Think about it.

666
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,840
What should we do next?

667
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,239
When I was little, I thought,

668
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,440
when I grew up,

669
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,440
I have a car

670
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,719
and a house,

671
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,519
With someone who loves me,

672
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,360
my life will be perfect.

673
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,760
But when I grow up, I realize that

674
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,719
this world,

675
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,920
It's much more complicated than I thought.

676
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Just like when I was a kid,

677
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,519
I have nothing.

678
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,039
You still have me.

679
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,719
Yes,

680
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I still have you.

681
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,159
if

682
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,119
When I can go back to college,

683
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,719
I will definitely choose

684
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,519
to stay in Shanghai

685
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,440
with you. I haven't had a job for all these years.

686
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,960
I feel like

687
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
I'm out of touch with this society.

688
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,400
Maybe the Luan family

689
