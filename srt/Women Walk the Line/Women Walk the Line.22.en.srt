1
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,280
This kid

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,200
didn't even tell me when he left.

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,950
Something urgent happened in the company,

4
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,590
so I asked him to leave.

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,350
You're back.

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,710
Aunt went to the small garden,

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,510
and my mom is a little dizzy.

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,040
Are you okay?

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
You don't need to call a nurse.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,870
It's okay.

11
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,230
Just lie down for a while.

12
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,920
Mom,

13
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,560
let me throw you a towel,

14
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,310
Yuan Ge.

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,190
I just thought about it again,

16
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,360
like Shanghai,

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,150
Big cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou

18
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,470
and Beijing,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,310
For you,

20
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,120
you're not too old.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,520
It's not long since you and Du started,

22
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,080
you must still face a lot of problems.

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,680
You should.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
From all aspects,

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,680
we can get to know each other better.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,310
So don't worry too much.

27
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,710
Your dad

28
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,560
is right.

29
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
You know, parents

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
have been through a lot,

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,030
He's a good judge of character.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
What's the old saying?

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,000
A horse's strength will be known by a long distance travel,

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
while a person's heart will be revealed by time.

35
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,240
Right?

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,150
You said yes,

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,310
but now there are some boys,

38
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,030
Dressed properly,

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,560
it's nothing.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,870
Auntie,

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Bingwen and I have known each other for a long time,

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
We get along quite well, too.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,710
You don't like to listen to me, do you?

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,800
Auntie has such a temper,

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,190
she's so outspoken

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,910
because she thinks of

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,150
you as herself,

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,120
Half a girl saw it,

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,520
that's why I'm talking to you.

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,470
I'm afraid you'll be deceived.

51
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,430
Yes.

52
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,030
Well,

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,680
Yuan,

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,470
Tell me the truth, I … I …

55
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,470
I … I …,

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,750
Sun Bin

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,190
and Du,

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,710
Which one of them is better?

59
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,840
Tell me the truth,

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,840
To be honest,

61
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,360
Sun Where is Mom?

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,520
Well,

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
aren't you dizzy?

64
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm not dizzy.

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
-I'm fine. -Mom Yuan, answer

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,030
me. Answer

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,190
me. -Wipe

68
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,150
your hands. -Wipe your hands. -I... I'll go out for

69
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
a walk.

70
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,030
Why should I wipe my hands?

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,470
-I'll cool down. -Cool down. -What are

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,590
you doing? -I'm coming

73
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,630
down.

74
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,680
Yuan, tell me,

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,190
Come on, lie down.

76
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,360
Tell me the truth.

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Take a break.

78
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,750
Hurry up.

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,030
What are you doing?

80
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,630
You keep telling me to lie down.

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,960
Miss Gu is here.

82
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,240
Is Mr. Xiong home?

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,070
He's not here.

84
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,800
He just went out,

85
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,630
I'm going to teach Ling Ling.

86
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,360
Miss Gu,

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
did you

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,160
quarrel with Mr. Xiong recently?

89
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,480
No.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
It's good that you didn't fight.

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
Mr. Xiong,

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
although sometimes

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,950
he has a bad temper,

94
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,190
But he's really a good man.

95
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,750
And I can tell,

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,390
he's sincere to you.

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,510
Mr. Xiong and I

98
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,800
are not the kind of relationship you think.

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
I'm sorry. It's my fault

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
for talking too much.

101
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,310
Go back to your work.

102
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,390
Everything is normal.

103
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,390
Not bad.

104
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,360
You're recovering well.

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Doctor,

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
listen to what you mean,

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,240
Me,

108
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,950
Can I leave the hospital now?

109
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,830
You can go through the discharge formalities tomorrow.

110
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,560
But usually be careful

111
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
not to touch the water on the wound,

112
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,480
Also,

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
try to eat a light diet,

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,630
Okay,

115
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
thank you

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
very much.

117
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,430
Thank you.

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,270
Of course.

119
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you, Wang.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,360
Have a good rest.

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
Okay, okay.

122
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,480
Thank you.

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,310
You're welcome.

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,310
Dad,

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
The doctor also said,

126
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,870
you should pay attention to your diet,

127
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,870
Take a good rest.

128
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
Pay attention to the wound.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,830
I know.

130
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,750
That's great.

131
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,750
I can finally leave the hospital tomorrow.

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,270
You sound like

133
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,040
you're in jail here.

134
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,720
Gu Qiao,

135
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,000
I should thank you first.

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,920
Look,

137
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,630
these days I've been in the hospital,

138
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,830
You're so busy with work,

139
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,390
and you always cook me

140
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,120
some delicious food.

141
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,630
Thank you so much.

142
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,600
Uncle,

143
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,430
what if you really love me?

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,070
Let Du cook for you

145
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,870
in the future.

146
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,680
Let me tell you,

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
Du cooks really well.

148
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,800
You know Du too?

149
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,000
Didn't Ge Ge tell you?

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
The three of us went to college together,

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,310
since when we were in college,

152
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,040
Du started chasing Ge Ge.

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Du

154
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,120
has never told me.

155
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,510
That's because he's dumb.

156
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,310
Let me tell you,

157
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,630
If he can say something,

158
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
how can he chase after Ge Ge

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,630
for so many years?

160
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,000
She ran away with other girls,

161
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,240
chased after her for so many years,

162
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,040
In that case,

163
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,830
he is still

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,160
a long-lasting young man,

165
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,950
It's more than long-term love.

166
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,830
You know what?

167
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,160
He has a great resume

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,310
abroad,

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,310
This is just to chase Ge Ge.

170
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,070
So I came back.

171
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,270
Yuan Ge,

172
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,070
who works for Ge Ge,

173
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
You never

174
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,560
told me that,

175
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,160
Dad,

176

Well.

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,830
How about this?

178
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll leave the hospital

179
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,830
tomorrow. Ask Du to come.

180
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,720
Of course.

181
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,830
Don't interfere with his work.

182
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,070
As long as he has time.

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,870
He has time.

184
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,000
He has time.

185
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,720
Ge Ge is on the phone.

186
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,560
Miss Gu, sorry to have kept you waiting.

187
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,160
Mr. Xiong asked me to tell you

188
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,950
that your request,

189
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,920
He has approved it.

190
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,270
As for the follow-up,

191
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,720
you just need to talk to Xueli directly,

192
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,390
That's enough.

193
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,830
Miss Gu is really amazing.

194
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,390
So soon?

195
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,870
We asked our boss to nod.

196
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,040
Come on.

197
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
Do you have any detailed requirements?

198
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,040
Just mention it.

199
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,310
I'll fully cooperate with you.

200
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Although it's a pity,

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,750
I didn't become your in-laws.

202
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,190
But I'm telling you, you … I'm in

203
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,680
Shanghai,

204
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,630
First friend,

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
no matter what,

206
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,630
I do feel happy.

especially during this period of time,

209
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,830
I got your mother and son's care.

210
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
Thank you so much.

211
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,920
Yuan,

212
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,950
you're being polite, you know?

213
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,440
Don't forget us in the future.

214
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Just give it to me. Thank you.

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,600
I can't forget.

216
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,390
for taking care of my father-in-law.

218
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,550
It may be hard

219
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,600
to see you again.

220
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
Let's say goodbye.

221
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,750
Congratulations,

222
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,550
I finally got your approval.

223
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,550
Let's leave a contact number.

224
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,120
Look,

225
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,840
For such a long time,

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
we haven't added WeChat messages.

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,510
Tell me,

228
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,840
Yes.

229
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
I'm going down to load the car.

230
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,390
Okay,

231

Yes.

235
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,600
Dad,

236
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,960
Bingwen went to load the car.

237
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,790
We can go now.

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,790
Aunt Sun,

We'll get going then.

243
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,480
All right, all right,

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,510
let's not talk about that,

245
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,630
Hurry up! Hurry up!

246
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,720
Yuan,

247
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,390
take good care of yourself.

248
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,440
Be careful.

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,790
Okay,

250
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,200
We've reached a certain age,

251
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,510
so take care of yourself.

252
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Okay, okay,

253
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,750
Goodbye.

254
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,600
Goodbye.

255
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Goodbye, uncle.

256
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,030
Goodbye.

257
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,480
Put it there.

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
I'll clean up later

259
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,630
and chat with my dad.

260
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,750
Dad,

261
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,910
Have some water.

262
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm going to clean up the room.

263
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,600
Have a seat.

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,750
Uncle is watching chess.

265
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,390
It's okay. Just look around.

266
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
You're amazing.

267
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,670
What does it say?

268
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,840
I can't understand any of them.

269
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
If you know how to play chess,

270
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,630
Chang Xia

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,000
Then you can understand the book.

272
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,960
Uncle,

273
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,480
Uncle,

uncle, do you like watching TV?

275
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,870
Let me open it and have a look.

276
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,910
Open it.

277
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,150
In recent years,

278

the incidence of cancer has increased year by year.

279
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720

the high incidence of cancer.

281
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
There is a kind of pain.

282
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,080
But I long for it. No,

283
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,600
no!

284
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,480
More!

285
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,670
No! No!

286
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,670
What product?

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,030
Infrared magnet health pillow.

288
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,440
It sounds amazing.

289
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
This pillow

290
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,630
is specially designed

291
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,790

292
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,240
What effect does it have?

293
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,120
It can promote blood circulation.

294
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
To strengthen immunity,

295
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,150
how much does such a powerful magnet

296
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,510
pillow cost now?

297
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,390
Today,

298
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,390
Uncle, this looks good.

299
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,480
Let me buy one for you.

everything is revived,

310
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,510
It's animal

311
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
breeding season again,

312
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,510
In the air of the mountain forest,

313
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,670
there is the smell of hormones.

314
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,960
Take a look.

315
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm back.

00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,910

318
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,510
The food is delicious.

319
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,630
Uncle, what did you do?

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,150
I didn't do it.

321
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,320
Yuan Ge did it. Ge Ge

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,030
is so good at it.

323
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,910
Where's Second Brother Du?

324
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,790
I have something to do at work,

325
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,840
so I asked him to leave first.

326
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,910
I mean,

left her here for dinner.

329
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,390
When he's with my dad,

330
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,630
he's so embarrassed.

331
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,390
You deserve it.

332
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
He wants to see his father-in-law.

333
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,630
Gu Qiao,

334
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,390
Come on,

335

Thank you, uncle.

Yuan Ge has found a boyfriend.

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,670
You have to hurry, too.

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Uncle, I'm not in a hurry.

339
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,150
Don't worry.

340
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,630
You're a few months older than her.

341
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,360
You should hurry up

342
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,550
and come to Dad for dinner,

343

getting along with Uncle?

349
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,150
Not bad.

350
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,120
Why do you still call him Second Brother Du?

351
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,870
how

352
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,320
I always call him Second Brother Du.

353
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,910
Now

354
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,870
you're biased, aren't you?

355
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
Of course not?

356
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,630
You will always be the woman I love the most.

357
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,240
Ge Ge,

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,550
do you also think,

359
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,120
I should find a man.

360
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Let's have a relationship.

361
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,120
Of course, I hope

362
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
you can meet someone

363
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,440
who really loves you.

364
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,910
And the people who take care of you.

365
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,910
Actually, I don't think

366
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,480
Xiong Qiming is suitable.

367
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,240
It's really inappropriate.

368
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
After I talked to him last time,

369
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,720
he deliberately avoided me.

370
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,550
I don't think he has

371
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,080
any feelings for me, right?

372
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,550
Actually, that's good.

373
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,720
Gu Qiao,

374
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,390
what my dad said,

375
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,240
Don't take it to heart.

376
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,440
I think your top priority

377
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,240
is to learn to be independent first?

378
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,270
When it comes to love,

379
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,670
I really can't rush it.

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,480
I understand.

381
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,600
Go to sleep,

382
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay,

383
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,270
Turn off the lights.

384
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,510
Ge Zi,

385
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,390
you're back.

386
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,360
Sit down

387
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,960
How is your father?

388
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,480
You're recovering well.

389
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,670
He has been discharged from the hospital.

390
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,120
You've been working hard lately,

391
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,030
and if you really need some rest,

392
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,870
You don't have to come to work every day.

393
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,790
It's okay, Mr. Fu. Gu Qiao

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,030
is taking care

395
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,840
of my dad too, right?

396
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,030
All right.

397
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Ge Zi,

398
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,510
there's one thing,

399
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630
I'd like to discuss with you,

400
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,150
it turns out that

401
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,440
our brand and popularity in foreign countries

402
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,240
are very high.

403
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,790
And our company's momentum

404
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,080
is so good now,

405
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,150
I was thinking,

406
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,030
can we open our shop

407
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,270
abroad,

408
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
What do you think?

409
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,120
Mr. Fu,

410
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,320
why do you suddenly

411
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
have this idea?

412
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,510
It's unrealistic.

413
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,960
No,

414
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,030
I think,

415
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,750
Let's not rush.

416
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
If you want to explore

417
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,150
overseas markets,

418
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,600
It's best to wait for Li Meng to further

419
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,110
lay a solid foundation in the country,

420
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,510
That's why it can be put on the agenda.

421
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,240
Actually, in my heart,

422
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,270
I understand.

423
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,550
I admit,

424
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
I was in a bit of a hurry.

425
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
But there is no denying that

426
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,550
I want to

427
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,880
explore overseas markets this time,

428
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,200
I thought if I did this,

429
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,680
I could spend more time

430
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,550
with Baona.

431
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,070
Mr. Fu,

432
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,550
actually, I can understand

433
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,790
how you feel now.

434
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,960
There are some things

435
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,400
that may not be appropriate for me to say.

436
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
But to me,

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,680
you're like family,

438
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,680
So I have to say.

439
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,640
If you want to

440
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
spend more time with Baona,

441
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,270
Actually, I think I can do it anytime.

442
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,350
In fact, sometimes,

443
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,920
when you know you're lying to yourself,

444
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
But he's still stubborn.

445
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,880
It's because no one around me

446
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,550
dares to sing

447
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,750
a stupid song,

448
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,510
Thank you.

449
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,160
Go back to your work.

450
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
Mr. Du, what can I do for you?

451
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,920
What about the success of the joint name?

452
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,830
It's all because of you.

453
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,590
I told Mr. Fu

454
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,590
to give you a promotion and a raise,

455
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,110
How much do you really

456
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,960
want to double the original?

457
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,790
That's great.

458
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,750
Thank you.

459
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,030
Because it turns out that your salary is low.

460
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,270
So I can mention this number,

461
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,790
thank you so much.

462
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll treat you to dinner later.

463
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Wait.

464
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,310
All you care about is salary increase,

465
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,640
but you don't care about promotion?

466
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,830
I'm telling you,

467
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
promotion is all in vain.

468
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,270
Only money is real.

469
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,720
Besides,

470
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,440
how about I be your assistant?

471
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,160
You can still

472
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,350
learn a lot.

473
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,200
Right?

474
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,200
That's right.

475
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm so flattered.

476
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,790
If I only get a raise and don't get a promotion,

477
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,350
can I get a little more?

478
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,880
I don't think so.

479
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,960
You can consider

480
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
taking back what you just said,

481
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,000
No, no, no.

482
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,880
I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Then

483
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,070
watch the ball well,

484
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm going down to work hard.

485
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,880
Go, go, go.

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,480
Thank you.

487
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,240
Son,

488
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,310
to be honest,

489
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,240
Yuan Ge,

490
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,640
It turns out that I really don't like her.

491
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,590
Do you remember,

492
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,960
when she came over that day,

493
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,550
With her father's attitude,

494
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,070
I think this kid is too strong.

495
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,830
I'm afraid that in the future,

496
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,750
if you really

497
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,880
find such a woman,

498
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
If I can't hold it down in the future,

499
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,720
during this period of time,

500
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,030
The more I look at her, the more I like her.

501
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,350
He's quite gentle.

502
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,240
Son,

503
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,270
you have to seize the opportunity.

504
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,350
We can't let them take it away.

505
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,030
Mom,

506
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,750
From now on,

507
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,270
don't ever say that again.

508
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,790
Yuan Ge already has a boyfriend.

509
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,790
That doesn't matter

510
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,640
Son

511
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,880
It's fair competition if you're not married yet.

512
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,920
Am I right?

513
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,270
Thank you.

514
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,350
Yanxi,

515
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,880
according to seniority,

516
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
You're the deepest one among us.

517
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
By rank,

518
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,880
you're the head of our department,

519
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
You're also the best at pressing.

520
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,480
The vacancy of Marketing Director.

521
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,510
You've been waiting for so long.

522
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,240
The boss didn't say anything,

523
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,270
but now he's suddenly

524
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,160
giving a new guy a promotion and a raise,

525
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,270
This is so weird.

526
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,030
It's fine

527
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,400
if you tell me these words.

528
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't tell Xia.

529
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,680
She's been close to Gu Qiao lately,

530
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,640
and,

531
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,270
Promotion and salary increase,

532
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,030
it's all Mr. Du's decision.

533
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,440
That's even weirder.

534
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,510
When Mr. Du first came here,

535
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,440
everyone saw that he was quite good.

536
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,270
I thought he would be

537
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,480
a strong opponent of Mr. Yuan,

538
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,960
I didn't expect

539
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,480
to see Mr. Yuan now,

540
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,750
It's like a mouse seeing a cat.

541
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,350
As a foreigner,

542
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,400
no matter how hard we try,

543
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,350
we can't compare with others.

544
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,550
What's the rush?

545
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,750
There's still a long way to go.

546
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,030
I'll get going now.

547
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Why hasn't she left yet?

548
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,110
I love work.

549
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,790
I love work.

550
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,720
Come in,

551
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,240
Master,

552
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,400
this document needs to be signed.

553
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,880
Why are you

554
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,110
so listless recently?

555
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
Maybe I didn't have a good rest.

556
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,790
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

557
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,720
Wait, Yeon-hee,

558
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,270
have a seat.

559
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,510
Let's talk,

560
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,030
Okay.

561
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,200
I remember

562
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,640
when Gu Qiao first came to Shanghai,

563
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,070
You have a good impression of her.

564
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,400
Then why?

565
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
Since she came to Shumei,

566
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,270
the conflict between you two

567
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,550
is getting deeper and deeper?

568
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,070
Can you tell me,

569
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,830
what's the problem?

570
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,350
Master, do you really

571
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,270
not know why?

572
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,750
Gu Qiao does not have

573
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,350
as much experience as you,

574
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,350
But how does Mr. Yanxi

575
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,200
decide

576
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,680
to arrange his own staff?

577
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
There are comprehensive considerations.

578
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,880
Master,

579
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,350
you keep telling me,

580
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,790
If we do things according to the principle,

581
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,880
then according to the principle,

582
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,350
Can Gu Qiao be admitted to Shu Mei?

583
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,720
In the end, it's still you who are biased.

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Do you really think

585
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't know anything?

586
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,240
You deliberately

587
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,830
dug a hole for Gu Qiao,

588
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,110
As a result,

589
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,160
when she was in the Docking Section,

590
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,960
It wasted a lot of advertising resources

591
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,310
of the company,

592
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
If it weren't for you

593
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,440
calling me Master,

594
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,960
Just because of this,

595
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,270
I can fire you.

596
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,240
Yanxi,

597
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
I've been beating around the bush

598
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,160
with you over and over again,

599
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,550
I just hope

600
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,790
you can change your mind in time.

601
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,200
But what about you?

602
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,200
Are you listening?

603
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Okay Master,

604
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,440
I also want to ask you a question,

605
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
If one day I,

606
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
Gu Qiao,

607
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,920
We made the same mistake.

608
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,110
Are you sure you won't take sides with her?

609
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,270
I'm sure.

610
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,200
Think about

611
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,310
what I said to you,

612
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,960
This is my last advice

613
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,030
to you.

614
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,750
All right. Go back to your work.

615
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,830
Congratulations.

616
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,830
You're really

617
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,400
my master's best friend.

618
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,590
If this goes on,

619
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,200
you should be able to

620
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
go hand in hand with her soon, right?

621
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,680
Thank you.

622
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,680
Ge Ge,

623
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,510
let's go to the mall on the way.

624
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,350
What do you want to buy again?

625
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,200
Buy some supplements for our dad.

626
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,680
I bought some fashionable clothes,

627
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,920
and I just made a few money,

628
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I can't hold it in my pocket.

629
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,110
Du Bingwen has told you,

630
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
I mean this second brother Du,

631
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
You're so quick-mouthed.

632
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,830
Taking credit from you again,

633
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,440
Gu Qiao

634
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,110
Even if you do your job well,

635
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,960
you don't have to care too much about other people's opinions,

636
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,960
But,

637
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,920
if it's okay,

638
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,510
I still hope that

639
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,550
you can get along well with everyone,

640
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,880
Your disciple

641
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
complained to you again.

642
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,270
Yes.

643
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,440
I can live in peace with her.

644
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,240
But the question is, can she do it?

645
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,240
Uncle,

646
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,750
we're back.

647
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,400
You're back.

648
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,790
Guess

649
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,480
what gift I bought for you?

650
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,000
You bought

651
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
so many things today.

652
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,000
Because we need to celebrate.

653
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Celebrate what?

654
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,030
It's a secret.

655
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,350
You even bought vegetables.

656
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,590
We were just passing by the vegetable market

657
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,070
and saw that the food was quite fresh,

658
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,480
And it's cheaper than online.

659
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,270
I told you before,

660
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,270
to buy vegetables,

661
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,920
Or do you want to go to the market yourself?

662
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,720
It's not fresh when I bought it online,

663
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,030
so I'll buy the food

664
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,400
from now on.

665
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,350
I'm idle

666
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,750
at home anyway,

667
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,480
I understand now.

668
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,270
Uncle,

669
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,440
it's boring for you

670
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,790
to be alone at home.

671
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
Put it there?

672
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,310
I'll sort them out later

673
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,110
and put them in the fridge.

674
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,920
I'll do it if it's okay.

675
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,270
Have a good rest.

676
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,440
Dad,

677
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,200
Gu Qiao got a promotion and a raise today.

678
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,510
He said he wanted to celebrate it.

679
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,070
Keep it a secret. That's it.

680
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,350
I should congratulate you.

681
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,510
I'll cook some dishes for you today.

682
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,920
Please don't,

683
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,790
Have you forgotten?

684
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm telling you at the hospital,

685
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,510
Du Bingwen's cooking is delicious.

686
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,790
We'll take care of it today.

687
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,830
Just try it.

688
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,960
No way.

689
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You called her here so suddenly,

690
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,640
cooking for us,

691
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,440
That's not appropriate.

692
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,310
What's wrong with that?

693
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,750
He wants to cook for you.

694
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,400
Ge Ge, call him.

695
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,400
If you don't hit me, I'll hit you.

696
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,070
I'll hit you.

697
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,350
Come and have a seat.

698
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,310
Come on,

699
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,310
Uncle, guess

700
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,400
what gift I bought for you?

701
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,550
What gift did you buy for me?

702
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,640
I don't need anything.

703
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,070
It's amazing. I'm sure

704
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,310
you've never seen it before.

705
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,510
Hey,

706
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,310
Where is it?

707
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
Where else could it be?

708
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,510
On my way home alone,

709
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
I had a girlfriend

710
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,550
who valued friends more than others.

711
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,640
My dad said,

712
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,030
Gu Qiao will be promoted today,

713
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,110
We need to celebrate it.

714
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,790
Come if you have nothing else to do tonight.

715
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,160
I'll be right there.

716
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,550
Is he coming or not?

717
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,270
He said he'll be there soon.

718
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,830
Okay,

719
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,880
Okay,

720
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,510
What is this?

721
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,440
How is it? Is it awesome?

722
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Try it and see if it feels good?

723
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,310
It's comfortable.

724
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,270
It's comfortable.

725
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,720
How much will it cost?

726
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,270
You can only earn money if you spend money.

727
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,350
Do you know how to earn?

728
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,830
It must be good at flowers.

729
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,350
You got a promotion and a raise in salary.

730
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,030
Here,

731
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,920
I'll give you a massage on your arm too,

732
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,880
If you play chess every day,

733
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
your arms will be so tired.

734
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,400
Relax.

735
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,310
How tired are your arms when playing chess?

736
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,480
Gu Qiao,

737
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,960
are you ready to go to the toilet?

738
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,110
Come and help me.

739
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,240
Du Bingwen

740
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,480
hasn't come yet,

741
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,550
Can we still have dinner?

742
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,680
Calm down.

743
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,030
You see.

744
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,880
Open the door.

745
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,510
I'll go.

746
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
Sun Bin,

747
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,030
why are you here?

748
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,830
Didn't uncle lose a chess piece?

749
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Yesterday, when my mom was discharged from the hospital

750
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
and packed her things,

751
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,000
I found this under the bed.

752
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
-Thank you. -Come on in.

753
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,030
It's too kind of you

754
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,270
to come again.

755
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,480
Well,

756
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,270
change your shoes. No need.

757
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,830
Come in.

758
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,640
Dad,

759
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,000
Sun Bin is here,

760
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,480
Sun,

761
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,880
Why are you here today?

762
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm afraid you'll be anxious, aren't I?

763
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,640
Look,

764
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,550
Sun brought me chess pieces.

765
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,640
Come on.

766
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,790

767
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,350

770
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,720
You're too kind.

771
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,160
That's great.

772
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,070
Look,

773
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,830

774
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,960
got you together,

775
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,440
Don't underestimate this chess piece,

776
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,480
you really can't do it without it.

777
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
That's right.

778
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,790
You're just in time.

779
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,240
Play the next round with me later.

780
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,640
I'll leave after dinner.

781
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,070
I won't eat dinner.

782
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,830
I've eaten.

783
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,310
You've eaten.

784
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,110
What time is it

785
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,400
just now? Nonsense.

786
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,510
Let me tell you,

787
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,830

790
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,830
Well,

791
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,310
Okay,

792
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,920
Let's play chess later.

793
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,590
I'll help Yuan Ge with his work.

794
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,720
Okay.

795

806
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,320
There's a liquor store.

I have something to do tonight.

808
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,960

812
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,710
I need to talk to you.

813
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,480
Besides,

Congratulations on your promotion.

821

I went home and got a bottle of wine.

822
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,710
Why did you drop the ball

823
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,550
at such a critical moment?

824
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,840
It's so hard to cook for uncle.

825
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,480
No one told me to cook.

826
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,510
Uncle, uncle.

827

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Uncle, I have something to do.

I have to go first.

852
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,440
Go away.

853
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,710

are all cooked for you.

855
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,190
To celebrate your promotion.

856
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,030
What's wrong with you?

857
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,920
I know, I know.

858

I'll cook for you next time.

860

863
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,070
You insisted on going out late at night.

864
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,800
It's okay. You guys are so delicious.

865
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
It's okay. Uncle,

866
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,440
you can eat.

867
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,190
She's so busy.

868
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,030
Okay, okay.

869
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,710
What a pity.

870
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,480
Uncle,

871
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,000
do you want to drink?

872
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,400
I went home and got a bottle of good wine.

873
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,030
This wine is exquisite,

874
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,070
You're very particular about it.

875
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,230
Uncle just got out of the hospital.

876
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,110
He can't drink.

877
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,070
Why don't I go and buy

878
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,030
some non-alcoholic beer for uncle,

879
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,800
Let's satisfy our cravings.

880
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,230
I'll go.

881
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,800
No need.

882
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,960
No need.

883
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,670
Sun is thoughtful.

884
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,960
I did. I just had surgery.

885
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,630
I can't drink.

886
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,880
I don't want to drink.

887
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,880
You young people drink it yourself.

888
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,760
No, no, no, no,

889
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,150
Uncle,

890
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,360
This wine is a special gift for you.

891
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,030
I went home to get it.

892
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,280
I'll drink it when you're ready.

893
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,920
Okay?

894
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,510
Come over there.

895
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,630
Hide it.

896
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,480
We don't want to drink anymore.

897
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,510
-Eat, eat, eat. -Okay. Come

898
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,360
on.

899
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,510
Uncle, eat more vegetables,

900
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,510
take more vitamins,

901
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,800
OK. OK. OK. OK. OK.

902
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,150
Hurry up!

903
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,360
Let's do it ourselves.

904
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
I'll get some more soup for uncle.

905
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,030
Replenish Qi.

906
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,360
That's enough.

907
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,510
Come on,

908
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,280
Okay, okay. Let me try it.

909
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,630
How about that?

910
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,840
As soon as the pepper is put in,

911
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,320
the taste will rise immediately.

912
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Very fresh.

913
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,320
This asparagus is good too. It's tender.

914
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,760
You can't eat soldiers,

915
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,480
Will

916
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,230
I won't even eat your cannon.

917
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,920
This is really going to work.

918
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,280
Block it.

919
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,800
It's a move,

920
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,480
a stepping stone,

921
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,360
Keep eating.

922
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,070
Will,

923
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,030
Well,

924
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,510
It seems like I'm really going to live here.

925
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,920
Uncle, you're awesome.

926
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,590
One more.

927
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,000
My dad seems to be on good terms

928
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,440
with that Sun guy.

929
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,710
He was kind enough to send chess to my dad,

930
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,960
but you,

931
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm late.

932
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,230
I'm still in the mood to go home and get changed.

933
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,800
You didn't make it clear on the phone.

934
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,920
What are you doing here?

935
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,030
I thought we were here to celebrate.

936
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,360
So I changed my clothes.

937
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,230
I didn't know Sun Bin was coming.

938
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,230
I'm jealous.

939
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,510
Why should I be jealous?

940
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,710
Tell our dad

941
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,000
to get off work tomorrow,

942
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,760
I'll make a table for him myself,

943
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
I'll carve a head of watermelon for him,

944
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,070
I'll show him.

945
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,150
What do you mean by real cooking?

946
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,440
What do you mean by real blade skills?

947
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,280
Look at the plate-setting today?

948
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,590
I don't have any appetite at all.

949
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,880
I can't even keep my mouth shut.

950
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll tell my dad someday.

951
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,230
Okay,

952
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,030
I'll tell him tomorrow,

953
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,960
as long as he agrees,

954
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,110
You have to get him to agree.

955
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm so pissed off.

956
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,230
Uncle,

957
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,960
it's getting late.

958
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,070
I should go back now.

959
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,960
If you're bored

960
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,110
at home,

961
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,030
You can also

962
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,960
walk around our house,

963
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,400
Although they are all in Shanghai,

964
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,320
the distance is too far away.

965
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,630
So you see,

966
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,590
in the hospital,

967
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,840
You stay with your mom in the hospital,

968
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,710
I want you to play chess with me,

969
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,150
That's not bad.

970
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,920
He's already out of the hospital.

971
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,710
I'll let you come to my place again.

972
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,360
Come with me,

973
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,440
I'll go to your house again,

974
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,190
I asked you to accompany me.

975
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,550
Thank you so much.

976
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,150
Forget it.

977
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,110
It seems that

978
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,440
I should go back to my hometown.

979
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,360
If you have chess friends back home,

980
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,440
go back home.

981
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,070
Uncle,

982
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
uncle, what you said is out of line.

983
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,920
It's no trouble at all.

984
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,840
My mom

985
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,320
said this weekend,

986
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,710
If you want to visit the Oriental Pearl,

987
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,320
isn't tomorrow the weekend?

988
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
I'm going to show her around.

989
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,710
Come with me.

990
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,920
Me,

991
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,280
Is it appropriate for me to go with you?

992
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,670
What's wrong with that?

993
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,400
Okay,

994
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,880
It's close to here anyway.

995
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,840
Both of them are busy at work,

996
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
so I don't have anyone to go shopping with.

997
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,670
Okay,

998
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,760
Tomorrow,

999
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,630
I'll go with you.

1000
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,320
It's a deal then.

1001
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,670
I'll go back now.

1002
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,110
Okay,

1003
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,510
Uncle, go to bed early.

1004
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,510
I'm leaving.

1005
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,630
Uncle, I'm done packing.

1006
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,400
I'm going back, too.

1007
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,960
Let me see you off.

1008
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,510
Okay,

1009
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,320
see his uncle off,

1010
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,150
See you next time.

1011
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,590
Sun, thank you for your hard work.

1012
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,440
It's not hard,

1013
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,360
See you tomorrow.

1014
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,440
See you tomorrow.

1015
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,960
How did you get here?

1016
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,670
public transportation

1017
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,150
It's everyone's responsibility to be low-carbon and environmentally friendly.

1018
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,030
Mr. Du,

1019
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,110
don't get me wrong.

1020
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,800
I passed by this neighborhood today,

1021
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,550
so I returned the chess to my uncle.

1022
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,230
No misunderstanding.

1023
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,190
Mr. Sun,

1024
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,070
my car consumes gas,

1025
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,230
It's not very environmentally friendly.

1026
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,230
I won't delay you from catching the last bus.

1027
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm leaving.
