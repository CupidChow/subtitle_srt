1
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,920
Why did you get up so early?

2
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,120
You didn't sleep all night, did you?

3
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,439
Shumei's press conference is like this,

4
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,319
don't be too sad.

5
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,599
What's on your mind?

6
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't keep it to yourself.

7
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
You can talk to me.

8
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,639
It'll make you feel better.

9
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
When Xiong Qiming

10
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
bought Jia Long off,

11
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Let Jia Long come forward and clarify

12
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,639
that Bai Xue didn't plagiarize,

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,919
So that I can

14
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,439
return to Shu Mei fair and square.

15
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,680
After Bao Lai found out about this,

16
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,199
he threatened him.

17
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,840
Ask him to buy Shumei.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,000
otherwise

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,039
Guangke will also fall into an economic crisis.

20
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,759
To put it bluntly,

21
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,840
It's all because of me.

22
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,360
His intention to help you

23
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,319
is good,

24
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,560
However,

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,159
he helped you

26
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,199
by hurting others like this.

27
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,960
Have you considered your feelings?

28
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,439
But if

29
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,800
Guangke hadn't fallen into an economic crisis.

30
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,919
I don't think he would do that either.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,439
You're kidnapping yourself

32
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,479
morally,

33
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,400
It's not like that at all.

34
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,080
Mr. Xiong is just a businessman,

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,439
before he makes all the decisions,

36
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,240
It must be for profit.

37
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,159
I don't care about anyone's feelings.

38
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,479
Including you.

39
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
I think,

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,680
as long as you

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,840
do something that hurts others,

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,599
Don't give yourself

43
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,560
any reason,

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,120
He instructed Jia Long

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,439
to pour dirty water on Shu Mei.

46
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,599
Now there's a lot of scolding on the internet,

47
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,439
saying that Shumei is cheating,

48
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,719
If you don't be honest,

49
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,919
if you continue like this,

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
Not to mention the acquisition,

51
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,360
Shu Mei is really doomed.

52
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,560
I know.

53
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,560
Is it because

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,399
Bao Lai promised to give it to Li Meng?

55
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,240
Overseas channels.

56
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,560
That's why I agreed to sell Shumei

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,319
to Baolai,

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,079
Well,

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
I've been abroad for many years.

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,519
I know a lot of friends too.

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,079
Please give me some time.

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
Maybe this overseas channel,

63
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,519
I can handle it.

64
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,040
If this hadn't happened,

65
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
I might have given you some time.

66
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,120
But I really

67
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,959
don't want to

68
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,199
take any more risks now.

69
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,079
Oh no.

70
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,399
Yuan Ge must be very sad.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
I can't coax him.

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,399
I've experienced too many setbacks,

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,279
Of course she'll understand.

74
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,600
Life needs to

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
constantly temper itself in adversity.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Ge Zi,

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,160
you must be having a hard time.

78
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,000
Now that you're back,

79
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
just stay with her.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
What she needs most now

81
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,720
is you.

82
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,439
Miss Gu,

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,319
is everything

84
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,160
you said true?

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,439
If that's the case,

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
it's not just Bai Xue plagiarizing,

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,040
It will be decided by the coffin.

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Besides, Guangke is also involved in

89
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
framing Shu Mei

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
in conjunction with the foreign capital,

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
As a reporter,

92
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,920
I have to make sure

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
the truth of this matter is true.

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
After all, this is no small matter.

95
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,720
Just because it's not a trivial matter,

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
I have to come forward and clarify,

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,639
Shumei is innocent,

98
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,519
but what's wrong is that

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm Borai,

100
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,639
It's Guangke.

101
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,439
I heard from you just now,

102
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,639
I feel like you have a close relationship

103
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,680
with Mr. Xiong from Guangke.

104
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,839
He did it to help you at first.

105
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,920
That's why Jia Long changed his mind,

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
setting the stage

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
for the next press conference.

108
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,120
In fact, as long as you don't come out to clarify,

109
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,279
the acquisition of Shumei Guangke by Baolai Group

110
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,439
is based on the momentum of Baolai,

111
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,120
Continue to be the dominant one in the industry.

112
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,920
You'll have a bright future too.

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,519
With all due respect,

114
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,639
Xiong Qiming treats you so well,

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
What did you decide?

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,639
I'm going to

117
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,600
expose it.

118
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,600
In life, everyone

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,879
has to make a lot of choices.

120
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,959
Whether you like it or not,

121
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,040
you must choose one.

122
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,279
And bear the consequences.

123
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,680
To me, Shumei

124
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
is not just a cosmetic brand,

125
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,240
It's also a kind of spirit.

126
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
So I can't do it for profit,

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
or because

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
foreign companies are suppressing us,

129
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,879
Just give it up.

130
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
And the public has a right

131
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
to know the truth,

132
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
So,

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,759
I have to do this.

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,639
I was wrong.

135
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,600
The food I bought this time is a little salty,

136
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,200
isn't it?

137
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
The food outside,

138
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
sometimes, is unreliable.

139
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
Then eat less.

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,399
This wine is really strong.

141
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,399
Mom and Dad,

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,759
I'm back.

143
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,519
Gu Qiao

144
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
Qiao Qiao,

145
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,559
why are you back so soon?

146
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Why are you back?

147
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,279
I made a temporary decision.

148
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,919
Come back and have a look.

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,639
You should have told me earlier.

150
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,559
So that your dad can pick you up

151
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,159
at the station.

152
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,000
That's right.

153
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,919
Come and eat.

154
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,639
I'm going to cook some more dishes.

155
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,279
Dad, no need.

156
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,440
Just eat this dish.

157
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,120
Stop messing around.

158
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,600
Fine, fine.

159
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,440
I'll get a bowl.

160
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,200
Come on.

161
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,399
Dad, it's heavy for me.

162
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,919
Is it so heavy?

163
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm fine.

164
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,600
Okay,

165
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,320
Just put it

166
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,399
here.

167
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,799
Girl,

168
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,440
come here.

169
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,480
Have a seat.

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,200
You suddenly

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
want to come back.

172
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,200
Are you not busy now?

173
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,919
I'm not busy anymore.

174
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,279
So I asked for leave

175
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,480
and came back to see

176
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,759
how you are doing Dad?

177
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,000
Everything is fine.

178
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,039
Dad, your back injury

179
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,120
is much better.

180
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,799
It's okay.

181
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,320
How are you doing out there?

182
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,799
I think I've gained a little weight.

183
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,919
I'm fine, Dad.

184
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,879
Where's Gu Liang?

185
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,879
He's been busy

186
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,799
with

187
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,320
his unreliable tea factory all day long,

188
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,679
It makes me angry.

189
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I don't care about him.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,799
Eat,

191
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,759
have a good meal,

192
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,840
It's been a long time

193
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,919
since you ate the food at home.

194
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,000
Dad,

195
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,279
Let me drink with you.

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,399
Really?

197
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll get the cup.

198
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,759
Oh my god,

199
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,320
bring me another glass.

200
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,120
Your daughter wants to drink with me.

201
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,840
Bring a glass.

202
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,480
Coming. Coming.

203
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm ready.

204
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm so happy.

205
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,200
Come on,

206
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,120
Be careful.

207
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,759
Mom, let me do it

208
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,240
Take it

209
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,440
The cup is in there.

210
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,399
Okay.

211
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,320
Come on,

212
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,080
Chopsticks.

213
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,320
Thank you, Mom.

214
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,639
Let me see.

215
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,159
You've lost weight,

216
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,240
gained weight,

217
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,399
You've lost weight,

218
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,679
gained weight,

219
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,200
No matter what,

220
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,519
my daughter is the prettiest.

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,399
Come on,

222
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,240
Come on,

223
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm so happy to see my daughter.

224
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,720
Let's touch each other.

225
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,480
Touch one.

226
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,159
It's comfortable.

227
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,559
Tomorrow,

228
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,759
Dad,

229
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,519
I'll make you

230
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,480
some specialty dishes.

231
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Exactly

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Make it easy today.

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,519
Let's have a big fight tomorrow.

234
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on,

235
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,200
Thank you, Dad.

236
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,120
Qiao,

237
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,159
have a seat.

238
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
It's been a long day.

239
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
Go get some rest.

240
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,679
Why are you sitting here?

241
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
It's quite comfortable

242
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,000
to blow here,

243
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,080
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

244
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,600
Is there something wrong?

245
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,200
What's wrong with me?

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,320
Mom, you're overthinking.

247
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,679
I just want you

248
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
to come back to see you.

249
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I haven't washed yet.

250
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm going to wash up.

251
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,639
Mom, you should go to bed early

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,440
for ten years,

253
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,320
For a brand,

254
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360
it's not that long.

255
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,120
But for Shu Mei,

256
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
it's not easy.

257
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,279
Ten years ago,

258
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,799
my business failed,

259
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
He's heavily in debt.

260
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,559
You look unkempt every day.

261
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,559
I can't even afford

262
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,519
a decent skin care product.

263
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,639
But

264
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,120
since then,

265
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,360
I decided to put all my eggs in one basket

266
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,519
and make one,

267
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,080
civilian skin care products

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,679
that are affordable

269
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,159
for all women in China,

270
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,679
In my opinion,

271
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
the fate of a woman,

272
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
It should be dominated

273
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,960
by women themselves.

274
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,039
I hope,

275
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
for more people who have dreams,

276
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,360
Women who have opinions escort us,

277
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,000
and it turns out,

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
We did it.

279
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
We made it.

280
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,919
Shumei has made it this far,

281
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,039
thanks to Mr. Fu's perseverance,

282
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,080
And her tough and soft personality.

283
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,039
The awakening of

284
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,440
feminine power that she describes

285
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,720
and the dilemmas

286
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,159
that independent women have to face.

287
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,519
And the impact of the capital market

288
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
on national brands.

289
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,399
All of this makes me feel the same way.

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,279
It was her speech

291
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,720
that made me decide.

292
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
Give my youth and future

293
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,320
to Shumei.

294
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,680
Mei,

295
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,440
Me

296
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,279
I know you don't want to leave Shu Mei,

297
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,319
or,

298
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,160
After you sign these words,

299
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
you should go back and rest early.

300
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,480
Someone from Baolai will come tomorrow.

301
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,319
No way.

302
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,480
Just leave it to me to do the docking.

303
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm fine.

304
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,119
Go back to your work.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,720
Mr. Fu,

306
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,079
Mr. Fu,

307
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,079
Look,

308
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,400
Shu Mei is on the news.

309
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,240
I've already agreed to sign it.

310
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,720
What is Bao Lai up to now?

311
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,440
I'm not sure.

312
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,119
I think Gu Qiao

313
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,720
is feeding Mr. Fu.

314
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,240
When we came here,

315
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,799
we saw a lot of comments from netizens,

316
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,640
Gu Qiao's clarification

317
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,039
still has a big impact on Shumei.

318
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,400
Many of our old users

319
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,480
are complaining about us.

320
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,079
It's said that Baolai's methods are dirty.

321
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,519
In this case,

322
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,839
it's not our fault.

323
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,039
Gu Qiao

324
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,160
has come forward to clarify it.

325
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,319
As long as we take relevant measures

326
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,160
in the future,

327
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,359
Minimize the damage.

328
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,759
Things still have a turn for the better.

329
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
Mr. Fu, are you selling Shu Mei

330
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,519
because you want to better

331
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,079
expand Li Meng to overseas markets?

332
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,160
If that's the case,

333
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,960
you can sell it with confidence.

334
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,160
Leave Li Juncheng to me,

335
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,359
and I will take care of him.

336
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,240
Okay.

337
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
I told you two to come back.

338
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,880
I just want to tell you,

339
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
I won't sell Shumei anymore.

340
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,000
Really?

341
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,319
Maybe as you said,

342
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
the future of Shumei

343
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,920
will only be

344
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,079
more difficult.

345
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,720
I want to go back to

346
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,839
the best days of the past,

347
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,799
It must be even more difficult.

348
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,079
You two,

349
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,880
are you really willing to

350
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,599
clean up this mess.

351
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,880
Continue to live up to

352
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,640
the dream of cheap domestic products.

353
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,359
Yes, I do.

354
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,880
Me too.

355
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,759
That's good.

356
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,680
Then.

357
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,680
From now on, it's up to you.

358
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,559
I'm tired.

359
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm going home.

360
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,599
As soon as Mr. Fu left,

361
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,000
you really did whatever you wanted.

362
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,680
You're doing well.

363
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,839
Compared to the last time I saw them,

364
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,920
I feel fatter.

365
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,920
Of course

366
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,680
How much fish food did you waste on me?

367
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,119
Mr. Du, remember to reimburse me.

368
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,200
When you're done with your work,

369
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,359
I'll take you out for a holiday.

370
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,119
I told Gu Qiao the same thing before.

371
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,640
Gu Qiao,

372
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,640
Gu Qiao

373
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,240
really shocked me this time.

374
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,799
I didn't expect that

375
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,000
in order to save Shu Mei,

376
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,000
You put yourself in it.

377
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,039
She doesn't even want Xiong Qiming anymore.

378
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,440
Gu Qiao has tried her best

379
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,680
to do what she can,

380
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,759
She really wants to stay in Shanghai.

381
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,960
I won't

382
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,319
let her leave like this.

383
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,720
So we need to find a way

384
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
to save Shumei.

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,839
Only in this way

386
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,359
can Gu Qiao come back fair and square.

387
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,079
Okay,

388
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,240
Then when this difficult task

389
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,160
is completed,

390
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,480
Let's go on vacation.

391
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
There are a few things I want to tell you.

392
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,160
First,

393
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,480
Mr. Fu will be here

394
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,039
for a long time.

395
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,680
In the United States,

396
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,559
I have limited energy on my own,

397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
Plus Shumei's situation,

398
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,640
it's not promising now.

399
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,880
Since Mr. Du is responsible for

400
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,839
Li Meng's performance.

401
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,839
It's obvious to all.

402
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,640
So I've decided

403
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,440
to manage and run

404
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,119
Li Meng and Shumei,

405
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,480
Completely independent.

406
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,519
From now on, regarding Li Juncheng,

407
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,039
you can report it directly

408
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,759
to Mr. Du.

409
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,880
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

410
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,079
Second,

411
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,720
Shu Mei has been through this storm,

412
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,759
If you want to return

413
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,039
to your original status,

414
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,119
It takes a lot of

415
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,680
energy and time to put in,

416
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,279
I know.

417
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,279
When you come out to work,

418
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,880
your primary goal is to earn money to support your family,

419
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,200
Second,

420
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,000
it's about pursuing dreams.

421
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,039
So,

422
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
if you have a better place to go,

423
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,680
I won't stop you.

424
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,440
Of course,

425
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,559
if you want to stay and fight together,

426
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,480
Then I can only declare in advance,

427
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,000
the current situation of the company,

428
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,440
Maybe the bonus and benefits

429
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,079
are not as good as before.

430
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,200
I can only draw cakes for you,

431
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
so that you can look forward to the future.

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,680
If I go out at my age,

433
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,079
it's not easy to find a job,

434
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
As long as Shumei doesn't kick me out,

435
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,079
I won't leave.

436
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,640
Even if my sister doesn't leave,

437
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,440
if I change my job,

438
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,119
There will be

439
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,519
no hitchhiking to and from work.

440
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,599
Besides,

441
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,039
Mr. Yuan is so confident,

442
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,359
I also want to challenge you.

443
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,200
Mr. Yuan,

444
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,640
may I apply to continue

445
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,279
following Mr. Du.

446
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,400
To develop Lili Group's product line,

447
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
I believe,

448
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,759
We can create

449
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,079
more and better products.

450
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,359
As long as Mr. Du accepts it.

451
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,279
Mr. Du,

452
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm fine.

453
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,440
No problem.

454
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,480
Thank you, Mr. Du.

455
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,480
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

456
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,440
Mr. Du,

457
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,359
I've learned a lot

458
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,200
about the high-end

459
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,960
cosmetics market.

460
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,319
Gu Qiao isn't here either,

461
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,480
so you need help too.

462
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,960
In fact, everyone has a chance.

463
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,160
It depends on what you do.

464
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,880
understand

465
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,359
I'll be in charge of Shumei.

466
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,880
Anyway, to me,

467
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,839
it's all the same.

468
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:36,880
Okay,

469
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,119
Next,

470
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,519
let's continue to discuss yesterday's,

471
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,599
About Shumei's

472
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,799
future work plan.

473
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,119
Please don't do this.

474
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,799
Don't be like this.

475
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
Get up.

476
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,240
Come on.

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,039
I'm sorry, Mr. Jia.

478
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,640
It's because of our dereliction of duty.

479
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,400
That's why

480
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,559
I brought you so much trouble,

481
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,440
I'm really sorry.

482
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,680
Although we know it,

483
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,319
we should

484
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,480
apologize to you now or something.

485
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
I can't make up for your loss.

486
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,640
We still have to tell you,

487
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,759
I'm sorry,

488
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
Yes,

489
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,359
you said it before,

490
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,440
Bai Xue plagiarized,

491
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,480
but I was lucky.

492
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,200
After hearing Jia Long's side of the story,

493
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
I didn't delve into it.

494
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,519
I've caused you

495
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,559
so much trouble,

496
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
I'm so sorry.

497
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,240
I can't blame you.

498
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,839
Actually,

499
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,759
investigate it carefully.

500
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,400
As a grandfather,

501
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,799
I failed to guide my grandson well,

502
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,000
Without teaching my son well,

503
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,839
how can my grandson

504
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
become so mercenary?

505
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,440
I don't have a principled position.

506
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,799
Speaking of which,

507
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
I have to apologize to you.

508
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,640
Don't say that.

509
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,200
No, no, no.

510
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,279
Sit down. Sit down.

511
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,640
Sit down.

512
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,240
nicely

513
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,000
Sit down,

514
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,359
sit down, sit down,

515
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,160
Sit down,

516
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,640
I heard that

517
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,039
Shumei Company is a rare company,

518
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,480
a company that

519
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,119
only sells domestic products at a low price,

520
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,960
The cooperation between you and Bai Xue,

521
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,559
is also to promote

522
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,400
the traditional culture,

523
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,920
This is the only one

524
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,920
worthy of praise.

525
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,680
You flatter me.

526
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,839
Mr. Jia,

527
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,599
actually, when we come here this time,

528
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,039
I want to talk to you

529
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,920
about the cooperation later,

530
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,519
Cooperation,

531
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes.

532
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,359
If you still have the intention,

533
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,640
you can still cooperate

534
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,559
with Shumei.

535
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,039
I... Just like

536
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
what we mentioned

537
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
in the previous contract,

538
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,079
The packaging of our products,

539
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,920
will be designed according to

540
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,240
the creative concept of your works,

541
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,200
No, no, no.

542
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,160
At my age,

543
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
my idea,

544
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,480
I can't connect with

545
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,960
the young people nowadays.

546
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
That's not true.

547
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,799
This generation of young people

548
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,359
is different from us when we were little.

549
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
They are interested in

550
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
the traditional culture of China,

551
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,319
Cherish and admire him more.

552
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,359
In their words,

553
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,640
the cartoon you drew,

554
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,960
is the real orthodoxy.

555
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,119
The original Guoman.

556
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,319
Old man.

557
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,200
Being so preoccupied all day long,

558
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,079
I really feel bad after seeing it.

559
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,079
Listen,

560
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,519
I have an idea.

561
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
How about

562
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,119
we sell the wedding room

563
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,240
for Gu Liang.

564
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,000
Return the money to Yuan Ge.

565
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,519
We're so sorry to you.

566
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,039
I was thinking,

567
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,319
even if we sell the house,

568
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,440
If we sleep on the street,

569
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,720
we can't cause her any more trouble.

570
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,680
Honey,

571
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,440
Actually,

572
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,279
I've had this idea for a long time.

573
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,240
But I didn't dare to tell you.

574
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,559
We need to find out the real estate license first.

575
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,480
Girl,

576
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,559
why are you sitting here?

577
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,119
Let me

578
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,119
tell you something,

579
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,720
After discussing with your mom,

580
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,640
we're going to

581
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,359
sell your brother's wedding house.

582
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,079
Pay off all debts.

583
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
You don't have to work so hard.

584
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,000
Dad, you don't have to do this.

585
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,119
I'll figure out a way

586
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,119
to take care of the money myself.

587
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,319
It's amazing.

588
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,720
Something happened.

589
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
Mom, what's wrong?

590
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,920
Be careful.

591
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,400
Have you seen the real estate license?

592
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,359
No.

593
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,359
The real estate license is gone,

594
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:11,440
Mom,

595
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,920
Aren't you the one who usually put it here?

596
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
Think about it. Where did you put it?

597
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,400
I put the real estate license

598
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,519
in a box in a drawer,

599
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,039
Everything else in the box is missing.

600
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,000
The real estate license is gone,

601
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,680
Did anyone

602
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,400
come to our house recently?

603
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,039
It seems that no one has been here.

604
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,759
Gu Liang.

605
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
It's Gu Liang.

606
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,039
Your brother came back some time ago,

607
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,160
saying that he wants to use

608
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,079
the real estate license

609
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,240
as a mortgage loan to do business,

610
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,519
Your dad refused, right?

611
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
No wonder

612
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,839
he didn't get a penny.

613
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,319
He just

614
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,720
disappeared quietly.

615
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
Daughter, where are you going?

616
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
Are you looking for your brother?

617
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,119
Don't hit him and talk nicely.

618
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:56,960
Remember to arrange

619
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,000
the best hotel for Baron,

620
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,920
We must make the guests live comfortably.

621
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,640
So that we can

622
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,519
talk about our business.

623
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,680
That's all for now.

624
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,839
Give it to me.

625
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,799
Sis,

626
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,759
What?

627
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,519
Ms. Real Estate Certificate,

628
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,880
what are you talking about?

629
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Are you still pretending to be with me?

630
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,839
When I came back from Shanghai,

631
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,839
I mortgaged it to the bank.

632
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,920
Where's the money?

633
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,400
All the money has been invested

634
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,240
in the operation of the company.

635
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,039
You brat.

636
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,599
Sister, don't hit me.

637
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,359
What are you doing every day?

638
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,240
Don't be angry, sister.

639
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,279
Sister,

640
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,000
listen to me first.

641
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,319
-Have a seat. -Sis, don't

642
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,279
worry.

643
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,160
Listen to me,

644
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,359
the tea factory

645
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,000
is going to be unable to make ends meet soon.

646
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,039
That's why I went to Shanghai.

647
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,039
I want to borrow some money from you

648
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,920
to make a turnover.

649
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,759
But didn't you take back

650
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,359
all the money

651
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,480
Xiong Qiming lent me?

652
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,559
Later, when I had no other choice,

653
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:58,920
I came up with the idea of

654
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,480
applying for a real estate license.

655
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,079
But I don't know,

656
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,440
I can still mortgage more than one million yuan,

657
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,359
Then I studied it

658
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,319
with my partner,

659
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,320
I just want to use the extra money

660
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,159
to contract more tea gardens,

661
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:12,559
Me,

662
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,440
We plan to be

663
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,039
the first sister of Shouxian County

664
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,199
Look at this office,

665
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,159
Our newly decorated

666
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,920
Chinese style,

667
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,239
Foreigners especially like

668
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,719
Gu Liang,

669
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,679
Are you out of your mind?

670
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,480
You.

671
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,000
Sis,

672
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,760
Sister,

673
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,039
please hear me out.

674
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,320
Sister, as you know,

675
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,480
tea is one of the top three drinks

676
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,599
in the world.

677
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,239
There are over three billion people in the world,

678
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,639
all of whom have the habit of drinking tea.

679
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,079
So no matter how depressed

680
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,119
the global economy is,

681
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,079
Tea merchants,

682
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,639
they don't worry that they can't make money.

683
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,760
So as a tea processing factory,

684
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,840
our order,

685
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,119
There will be a steady stream,

686
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,800
Sis,

687
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Sis,

688
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,639
Drink this tea.

689
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,400
Gu Liang, a specialty of Anhui Province,

690
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,039
let me tell you,

691
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,000
Don't make such a fool of yourself.

692
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,559
Bring back the real estate license.

693
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,440
I left the house for my parents

694
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:04,920
to support their old age,

695
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,119
It's not for you.

696
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,760
Also,

697
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,800
don't think about these things.

698
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,840
You're not cut out

699
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,440
to be a boss,

700
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,199
But when you were little,

701
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,280
your grades weren't good either.

702
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
It was Yuan Ge who helped you with your tutoring.

703
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,159
You just got into the university.

704
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,280
Why can you just try?

705
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,239
I can do nothing.

706
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,920
Because you're using my money,

707
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,280
I'm telling you,

708
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,639
My parents are old,

709
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,400
I don't want them

710
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
to be scared with you,

711
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,159
Sis,

712
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,239
So in your eyes,

713
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,760
that's who I am.

714
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,639
Yes.

715
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,840
That's right.

716
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,800
He's the one who did it.

717
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
We must clear Mr. Jia's name.

718
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,480
Otherwise, we can't get through this.

719
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,239
Apologize to Mr. Jia,

720
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
and clear his name.

721
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,519
That's right.

722
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,079
This guy

723
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,320
is Xiong Qiming's car.

724
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,000
Over there.

725
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,639
I'm coming.

726
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:05,960
This car,

727
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,320
Xiong Qiming,

728
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:06,960
Xiong Qiming,

729
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,360
Xiong Qiming,

730
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
Get off. Get off. Xiong Qiming,

731
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,840
get off.

732
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:11,800
Apologize.

733
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,039
Get off Xiong Qiming

734
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,559
Get off Xiong Qiming,

735
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,559
Xiong Qiming apologizes to Mr. Jia,

736
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,440
apologizes to Mr. Jia,

737
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
Apologize to Mr. Jia,

738
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,400
Xiong Qiming,

739
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,119
Apologize,

740
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,599
Xiong Qiming

741
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,480
Apologize,

742
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,960
Apologize to Mr. Jia.

743
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,320
Mr. Xiong,

744
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,239
three more clients

745
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,840
asked to cancel the cooperation with us this week,

746
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,039
He also asked for damages for his reputation.

747
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,239
Got it.

748
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,920
How is it going with what I asked you to do?

749
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Borai received an anonymous complaint internally

750
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,920
that David was taking a kickback,

751
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
Misappropriation of public funds,

752
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,239
he has been

753
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,559
suspended for investigation.

754
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,199
It's very likely that there will be a prison case.

755
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,920
Okay.

756
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,199
Mr. Xiong,

757
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,039
don't blame me for talking too much.

758
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,280
At this time,

759
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,599
are you still thinking of helping Shu Mei

760
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,639
and Gu Qiao?

761
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,719
They don't care about you at all.

762
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,559
Go back to your work.

763
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay.

764
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Your brother hasn't

765
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,039
come back yet.

766
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,719
Your mom and I called him,

767
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,639
but he didn't answer.

768
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,199
There must be something wrong.

769
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,559
Why don't you go to see him?

770
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm not going.

771
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,960
Gu Liang fought since he was a child,

772
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
skipped classes and had puppy love,

773
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,159
You don't care.

774
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,599
Just spoil her like this.

775
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,519
You've grown up.

776
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,280
You even dare to steal the real estate license.

777
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,400
If you spoil Gu Liang like this again,

778
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,320
it will be over.

779
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,320
We are responsible for

780
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,280
your brother's education.

781
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,760
But.

782
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,960
It's not that easy to be a parent.

783
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,920
What is it?

784
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,119
This one

785
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,039
It's the contract I signed with Barents.

786
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,480
It's written in black and white.

787
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,159
It can't be fake, right?

788
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,599
This afternoon,

789
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,239
they called me the first one.

790
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
In the next two days,

791
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
I'll go to the bank

792
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,679
and redeem the real estate license as soon as possible.

793
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,079
Don't be mad at me.

794
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,719
I know.

795
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,119
Ever since I was a kid,

796
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,639
you've always thought that I'm not capable,

797
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,800
Look down on me,

798
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,199
I know,

799
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,039
My parents only spoil me,

800
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,440
and you don't feel well,

801
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
But it's true that

802
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,039
I wasn't sensible

803
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,480
when I was a kid,

804
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,599
My grades are not good either.

805
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,280
My EQ is not as high as yours.

806
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,000
always

807
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,039
I caused trouble for you and your parents.

808
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,599
But I'm different now.

809
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,000
I really want to

810
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,440
start a career now,

811
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,079
I don't want people

812
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,920
to look down on me all the time.

813
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,599
Sis,

814
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,760
Trust me, okay?

815
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,599
You must be hungry.

816
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,639
I'll get you something to eat.
