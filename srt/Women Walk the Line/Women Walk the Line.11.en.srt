1
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,280
Mr. Yuan.

2
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,040
Drink more juice

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,359
and less coffee,

4
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,000
The fruit juice is healthier,

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
the fruit is juiced,

6
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
It will lose its cellulose

7
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,480
and only sugar and water will be left.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,159
So it's not

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,840
much more nutritious than coffee.

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay,

11
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,480
Then I'll buy something else.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,079
No, thanks.

13
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,960
Just in time.

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
I need some sugar.

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,439
Okay,

16
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,039
I won't disturb your work.

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,319
Mr. Du,

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,879
is there anything else you want to see me for?

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Just a fruit juice?

20
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:24,719
Yes.

21
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,879
Goodbye.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,159
Mr. Du,

23
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,479
you didn't pursue me for the Blue Eagle matter?

24
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,039
I haven't had time

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
to thank you.

26
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,680
As long as Guangke is done.

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,879
Don't worry.

28
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,919
From now on, regarding Guangke,

29
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,520
I won't make

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
any mistakes.

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,120
Okay,

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
work hard.

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Hao Shuai,

34
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,159
come here.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,719
This one

36
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,879
It's some office stationery you asked for.

37
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,039
Let me know if you need anything.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
Then let's go to

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,159
the HR department later,

40
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,400
Fill in your entry information.

41
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,439
Okay.

42
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,199
You're not going to

43
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,120
explain it to me.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,599
Why are you here?

45
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,280
I've thought about it.

46
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,240
Anyway, it's just an internship,

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,879
so I might as well come to your place.

48
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,039
Then it won't be transparent.

49
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,560
Am I right?

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,599
Besides,

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
I just heard that,

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,319
Shumei has a serious imbalance between men and women,

53
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,039
and what she lacks the most is,

54
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,000
A handsome guy like me,

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
why don't you find another company?

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,520
It's not too late.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,319
Brother, don't be so unique.

58
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,000
Am I right?

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Besides, if I stay,

60
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,000
I can support you.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,759
Pursue your sister-in-law.

62
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,280
I need you to support me.

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
Two people are better than one.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,039
But you have to tell me first,

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,439
I just swept a circle,

66
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,199
I didn't see anyone

67
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,120
who's married to you, either?

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,680
Who is it?

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,959
Are you here as an intern,

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,839
or are you here to make trouble?

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,759
I'm here for internship.

72
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm here for work.

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,079
I'm not here to make trouble.

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
I'll work hard.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,519
I won't embarrass you.

76
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,439
Really?

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,920
All right?

78
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,680
But remember,

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
don't let anyone know

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,560
about our relationship,

81
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,600
When others found out,

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,560
it was the day your mom

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,839
came to pick you up.

84
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,079
I understand.

85
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,959
I won't tell you.

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,959
Don't worry.

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,199
I'm leaving.

88
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Okay,

89
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,399
Go to work.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,439
Thank you.

91
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,480
Sis,

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Do you need any help?

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,319
You have a good sense of consciousness.

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm going to the warehouse.

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Come with me.

96
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,399
Okay, okay.

97
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:18,920
Thank you.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,399
Sis,

99
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,120
Do you know anyone

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,439
from Jiangdong University in our company?

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,879
What are you doing

102
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,639
You need to find senior brothers and sisters to get along with each other.

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I want to,

104
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,120
but with poor grades like mine,

105
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,519
I can't get into such an advanced university.

106
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
I just want to know,

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,519
people from Jiangdong University,

108
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,920
Do they all have an IQ of 180?

109
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,519
Yes, I am,

110
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
no wonder

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Your temperament

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
is different from theirs.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
I love rainbow fart.

114
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,720
Sis,

115
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,600
Well,

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
I heard that Mr. Du

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
also graduated from Jiangdong University,

118
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,240
Then you.

119
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
Have you known him for a long time?

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,079
As an intern,

121
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,240
why do you ask so many questions?

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Then you admit,

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
you have a different relationship with Mr. Du.

124
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,319
Don't let anyone in the company

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,240
know that I understand.

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,199
Keep it a secret.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,879
I'm exhausted.

128
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,399
Ge Ge,

129
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,639
I proofread documents every day,

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,399
Print some materials.

131
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,279
Why?

132
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,360
Why are you so tired?

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
You said you didn't do anything.

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,439
And exhausted.

135
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,000
Before,

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,879
I thought,

137
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,240
You're just an assistant, aren't you?

138
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
How tired can it be?

139
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,040
It's not easy for us to find out now.

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Maybe

141
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,680
I should go and say hi to them.

142
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,360
No.

143
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,759
On the road to work,

144
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,399
you have to walk it on your knees.

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,399
In the spa,

146
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
I've never seen you work so hard before.

147
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,480
After all, it's all because of me.

148
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,079
Otherwise, why don't you be so serious

149
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,839
in Shu Mei?

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,199
It's different.

151
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
When I was in the spa,

152
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,319
I thought I was right.

153
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,399
And my ability

154
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,360
is no worse than theirs.

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
That's why I'm confident.

156
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,079
But when it comes to Shu Mei,

157
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,959
I have self-knowledge.

158
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
Based on my experience,

159
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,959
I can only work like a handyman.

160
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,399
There's nothing else I can do.

161
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,759
It hurts.

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,839
Don't press it for me. It hurts.

163
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,360
If you really care about me,

164
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
order me something to eat.

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
I didn't eat anything.

166
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:28,959
Tell me.

167
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,639
What do you want to eat?

168
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,360
Fried chicken,

169
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,279
one whole serving,

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,839
Wait.

171
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,839
One more beer. It'll make you happy

172
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,079
to think about it.

173
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,959
I'm just kidding. I didn't sleep.

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,040
Bingwen,

175
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,199
why aren't you cooking yet?

176
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,279
I'm starving.

177
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,120
Is she

178
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,120
your sister-in-law?

179
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,720
Fine. Don't

180
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,919
worry about it. Don't worry about it.

181
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
What are you doing here?

182
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,320
I asked you to cook,

183
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,840
didn't I give you money?

184
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,480
Order takeout.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,200
I don't want to eat takeout.

186
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,159
I just want to eat your cooking.

187
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,639
I don't have time to cook for you.

188
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,159
Okay,

189
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,720
Then how much more

190
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,399
can you transfer to me?

191
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,159
two thousand

192
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,240
I'll transfer it to you.

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,879
Get out of here!

194
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,080
Turn right away.

195
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Turn right away. Turn right away.

196
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,679
Let's go!

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
I have an elevator.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
Hold on a second.

199
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,320
Sister,

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
hurry up. Thank you.

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,039
Are you a lady?

202
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,200
No.

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,440
Me

204
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm overweight.

205
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,519
I'm overweight.

206
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,720
They are overweight.

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,559
You should leave now.

208
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,720
You may leave. You're overweight.

209
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,480
Wait for the next one.

210
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,279
The elevator is overweight.

211
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,320
Go down now.

212
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,679
You can leave now.

213
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,759
Wait for the next one.

214
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,879
You.

215
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Yanxi,

216
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,840
sales in South China

217
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,639
have been trending downward for three consecutive months.

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
Have you checked why?

219
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm working on it.

220
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Give me an answer as soon as possible.

221
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,639
Understood.

222
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,399
Mr. Du,

223
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,639
how is the counter

224
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,519
in Li Mansion going?

225
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,840
Can we enter the venue as scheduled?

226
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,679
The three-dimensional renderings are out.

227
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,960
But it's not ideal.

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,399
If we want to change it now,

229
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
we need to make an additional budget.

230
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,120
Anyway, I sent the picture to your email.

231
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,279
You can take a look first.

232
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,200
The product department is full of young masters,

233
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
who just ask for money,

234
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,159
But Mr. Yuan

235
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,639
is more stingy than Mr. Fu.

236
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,000
How about this?

237
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,759
It's up to you to decide about the counter.

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,639
Li Meng's position is in the high-end market,

239
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,279
so we can't save the money we should spend.

240
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,279
Okay,

241
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,080
After Li Juncheng goes online,

242
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,399
everyone will be busier.

243
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,679
Mr. Fu, you mean,

244
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,720
right now,

245
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
If all departments get together,

246
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,440
everyone will volunteer to participate.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
All right, that's all

248
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
for today's meeting.

249
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,519
Dismiss the meeting.

250
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
Mr. Du, stay here for a while.

251
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,480
Okay,

252
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,679
Mr. Liu,

253
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,360
the due date is coming, right?

254
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:21,919
Yes.

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,559
But I will definitely arrange

256
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,480
the progress of the work.

257
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,159
It won't delay Li Meng's launch.

258
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,639
If you don't feel well,

259
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,720
you'll take maternity leave early,

260
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,559
Don't try to be brave.

261
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,360
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

262
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,399
Be careful.

263
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,600
It's okay.

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Come on,

265
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,879
I'm fine.

266
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,919
Why is there something wrong

267
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,000
with these two today?

268
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,879
It's okay.

269
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
Just enjoy yourself.

270
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,159
Sales in South China

271
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
continued to decline for three consecutive months.

272
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,919
I want to hear it.

273
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
What do you think is the reason?

274
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,879
It's time for dinner.

275
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm so hungry.

276
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,360
Have you eaten?

277
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,159
Let's get down to business.

278
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,919
Eating is also a business,

279
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,120
and eating is for better work.

280
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,519
Talk over dinner,

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Let's go.

282
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Did you see

283
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,000
what Fan Fan posted in the group?

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,559
Mr. Du went out for dinner

285
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,679
with Mr. Yuan.

286
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,960
When you said that, I just remembered

287
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,039
that

288
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,519
Zheng Jinnan,

289
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,399
It seems that she hasn't appeared for a long time.

290
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,440
That's right.

291
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,240
You sent flowers

292
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,440
and milk tea before,

293
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,840
She suddenly disappeared.

294
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
There must be something wrong.

295
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,000
That means we didn't catch up.

296
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,360
As I've told you,

297
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
Mr. Yuan has never been in a relationship,

298
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,919
For the first time,

299
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,320
how could it be so smooth?

300
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,879
I won the bet.

301
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,120
Someone wants to buy you milk tea?

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,879
I want it at normal temperature,

303
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,360
sugar-free, pearl red beans,

304
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,559
Two cups?

305
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,720
Please go ahead.

306
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,159
Do you dare

307
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
to bet with me again.

308
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,080
What are you betting on?

309
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
Shall we bet on Mr. Yuan, Mr. Du,

310
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,360
and Gu Qiao for dinner?

311
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,120
No. Why?

312
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,840
Here's the beef rice.

313
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,919
I'll go out

314
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,240
and eat it myself later.

315
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,120
It's a waste if you don't eat it.

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,720
Okay, thanks.

317
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,399
It's okay. It's my duty.

318
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,559
Hao Shuai,

319
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,039
are you free tonight?

320
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,799
I don't have time.

321
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,840
I just want to

322
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
invite you to watch a new movie.

323
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,360
Cupid's arrow?

324
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,360
What is that?

325
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
I gave her to you.

326
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,399
If you can't take it,

327
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,559
I won't return it.

328
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
What do you know?

329
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,559
True love requires persistence.

330
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,600
I want to use my stunning appearance

331
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,480
and sincere heart.

332
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,799
To influence him.

333
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,559
You two

334
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,360
are having dinner together?

335
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
You're well-informed.

336
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,240
Of course not.

337
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,360
Tell me,

338
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,080
how is it going?

339
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,679
What progress?

340
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,720
Pretend,

341
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,039
Reinstall

342
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,720
One of you is really stupid

343
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,559
and the other pretends to be stupid. You're perfect for each other.

344
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,399
I'm warning you,

345
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,519
saying I can do it,

346
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,600
It can't be said that Yuan Ge

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,799
is still strong now, right?

348
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,159
You're talking nonsense to me now,

349
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,679
aren't you?

350
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,399
I asked you to protect me. I asked you

351
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,399
to protect me.

352
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,320
I asked you to protect me.

353
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,159
Protect the nonsense.

354
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,039
Water, water.

355
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,039
Inside.

356
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,759
Sorry,

357
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,720
I made a mistake.

358
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,120
Go on.

359
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,559
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,399
Is there any relationship

361
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,320
between you two?

362
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Me and him,

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,759
how would I know?

364
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,080
Where did he come from?

365
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,759
Mr. Xiong, I'm sorry.

366
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,720
There's a traffic jam.

367
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,679
Sorry to keep you waiting.

368
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,879
Please have a seat.

369
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,839
Waiter,

370
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,000
a glass of lemonade,

371
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,200
Yes, sir.

372
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,839
Mr. Xiong, I'm sorry.

373
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,200
Last time at the airport,

374
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,319
what happened last time,

375
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,119
I should apologize to you.

376
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,920
That day at the airport,

377
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
I was really in a hurry,

378
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,880
I hope you don't take it to heart.

379
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
No, no, it's not my problem.

380
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,079
I knew you were in a hurry,

381
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,960
but I used Ling Ling as a cover,

382
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,279
Actually,

383
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,519
I understand.

384
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,920
So,

385
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,680
I also want to know that Miss Gu

386
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,200
was looking for me at the airport last time,

387
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,720
What's the matter?

388
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,759
Am I right?

389
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,400
You want to change your working environment?

390
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
I am very satisfied

392
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,359
with my working environment.

393
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,160
Well,

394
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,279
since you don't want to say more,

395
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,799
I won't ask any more questions.

396
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,319
Here's the thing. What happened

397
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,839
after you left?

398
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,839
Ling Ling often mentions you to me,

399
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
I can see that,

400
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
She really likes you.

401
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,599
That's why I came to see you today.

402
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,599
I also want to ask you,

403
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,279
I wonder if you are interested

404
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
in tutoring Ling Ling,

405
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,319
To tutor Ling Ling,

406
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

407
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,079
The course is up to you.

408
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,480
No less than twice a week.

409
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,519
The monthly salary is 10thousand,

410
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,119
10thousand,

411
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,319
What do you think?

412
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,279
You can take your time to think about it.

413
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,359
Eat something first.

414
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,119
How did you reply to him?

415
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,519
I told you I'd think about it.

416
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,599
What are you thinking about?

417
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,559
I'm sure I can't be

418
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,359
a tutor.

419
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
That's 10thousand yuan.

420
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,680
I've been working in Shumei

421
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,960
for a month

422
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,880
and I can't even get that much.

423
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,119
You know

424
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,359
you work in Shu Mei?

425
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,880
Let me analyze it for you.

426
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,680
Before that,

427
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You pretended to be an employee,

428
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,319
broke into his company,

429
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,640
And then you happened

430
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,119
to meet the missing spirit.

431
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,759
Plus your delay at the airport,

432
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,599
what do you think

433
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,400
Xiong Qiming

434
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,880
will think?

435
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,920
Xiong Qiming is

436
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,160
a shrewd businessman,

437
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,880
With so many suspicious coincidences

438
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,000
on your back,

439
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,000
Now he simply

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
asks you to be his tutor,

441
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Do you think

442
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,079
it's that simple?

443
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,799
But it's such a coincidence.

444
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,319
Besides, Xiong Qiming and I

445
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,559
don't have much time together,

446
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,119
But I don't think

447
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,559
he's as insidious as you say.

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,079
All in all,

449
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,680
this tutor,

450
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,279
You can't do it.

451
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,920
If you have the time,

452
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,119
you might as well improve

453
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:36,920
your professional skills,

454
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,559
Besides,

455
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,920
when it comes to work,

456
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,359
We'll meet sooner or later.

457
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
It'll be awkward then.

458
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,920
If I take a two-month break this year,

459
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,519
I can still earn 100 yuan.

460
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,519
100thousand。 .

461
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,039
You want to see me?

462
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,960
I heard from Sister Wang

463
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,200
that you're not going to dinner tonight?

464
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,839
I won't go.

465
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,079
You youngsters go and play,

466
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,240
Mei,

467
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,880
You came home alone,

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
so why don't you join us

469
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
and have fun.

470
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm a bit busy today.

471
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,720
Baona will be back tomorrow.

472
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,400
So I want to go home

473
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,319
early tonight.

474
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,319
Let's decorate

475
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,079
her room again,

476
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,920
Just let me do my work.

477
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,880
Auntie used to clean it,

478
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,599
but Baona is 18 years old,

479
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,359
I want to decorate it for her myself.

480
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,000
It's kind of ceremonial,

481
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,559
at this time of year,

482
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,480
It's the time

483
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,920
when you smile the happiest,

484
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,720
Really?

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
It's rare for Baona to come back,

486
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,960
so I won't bother you tomorrow.

487
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,000
This one

488
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,519
It's a gift I bought for Baona.

489
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,079
Please give it to her

490
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
for me.

491
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,680
Then I must thank Baona

492
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,519
here

493
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,200
on behalf of her aunt.

494
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,799
You said if Baona

495
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,559
is willing to go back to China and inherit my career.

496
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,720
I'm sure you two

497
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,359
are the best partners,

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,119
I'm sure she'll like you a lot.

499
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,640
Of course. Mr. Fu,

500
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
go ahead with your work.

501
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
We'll get going then.

502
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,400
Have fun.

503
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,400
Okay.

504
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,160
Sister,

505
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,000
do you want some water?

506
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,799
I need water, too. Let me help you.

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,039
Thank you.

508
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,640
You're welcome.

509
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,599
Look at your Prince Charming,

510
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,200
who has been serving Gu Qiao tea.

511
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
After riding around,

512
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,079
he's going to be

513
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,079
his personal guard.

514
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,759
He has always

515
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,960
been so nice.

516
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,519
Are you interested in Gu Qiao?

517
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm telling you,

518
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,599
if we don't attack again,

519
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,359
I'm afraid I really don't have a chance.

520
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,519
Hurry up!

521
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,279
Gu Qiao,

522
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,240
here, here, here.

523
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Gu Qiao, come on.

524
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,920
Get in the car.

525
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:41,880
Come on.

526
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,920
Mind your own business.

527
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,119
Feet, foot, foot, foot, foot, foot, foot,

528
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,039
foot, foot, foot, foot.

529
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,640
Let's go.

530
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,759
Wait.

531
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,039
It's okay.

532
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,119
We have a car, too,

533
00:23:59,319 --> 00:23:59,880
Let's go.

534
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,200
Mr. Du,

535
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,359
I heard that you went to the same university

536
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,160
as Gu Qiao,

537
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,480
What's wrong?

538
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,640
Are you in the same class?

539
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,240
It's still brother-sister relationship.

540
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,599
We've known each other since college.

541
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,759
Hao Shuai, right?

542
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,559
I'm new here.

543
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,039
Focus on your work.

544
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,039
Don't gossip.

545
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,759
Aren't we

546
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,680
going to have dinner later?

547
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,799
I'd like to have a chat.

548
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,480
At work,

549
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm sure

550
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,279
I'll talk about it seriously.

551
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,319
Gu Qiao,

552
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,119
I heard that

553
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,400
you don't have a boyfriend,

554
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Mr. Du doesn't seem to have a girlfriend either.

555
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,240
So you want to

556
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
set us up?

557
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,359
No, no,

558
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,519
no. I'm an intern. I,

559
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,160
No

560
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,000
No, no, no.

561
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,240
I just feel like

562
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Mr. Du is a nice person,

563
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,319
What about hardware?

564
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,480
Strong professional ability,

565
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,359
good financial conditions,

566
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,599
In terms of software,

567
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,599
he's handsome, too.

568
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,319
Right?

569
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,519
Although he's a little short of me,

570
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,640
don't look at

571
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
the way he's dressed,

572
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,599
It's low-key,

573
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,319
but it's very sensible,

574
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,240
Right?

575
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,640
And you may not

576
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,359
notice it normally,

577
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
This hand of his

578
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,680
looks like someone who has been healthy.

579
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,079
Right?

580
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,440
It's really strong.

581
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,640
And I guess

582
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,400
Mr. Du must have six-pack abs.

583
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,079
Right, Mr. Du?

584
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,640
Then.

585
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll send you a picture later.

586
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,359
Okay,

587
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,319
Gu Qiao,

588
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,839
I also heard that,

589
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
Mr. Du is so virtuous

590
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,640
that he can go to the hall,

591
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,759
When you can get into the kitchen,

592
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,160
you always

593
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,200
clean up the house.

594
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,960
What about a man like that?

595
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
He must be a good husband.

596
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,240
Why do you know him

597
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,119
so well?

598
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,400
Feel it.

599
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,160
It's really good.

600
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,279
Right?

601
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,039
Anyway, I think,

602
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,559
Yes.

603
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
Both of you are single.

604
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,160
It's good.

605
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,759
You can give it a try.

606
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,160
It's good.

607
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,839
What's wrong?

608
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,720
Are you backing down now?

609
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Didn't you say that

610
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,759
true love needs to be sustained?

611
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,079
You have to influence him with your heart.

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
To influence who?

613
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,119
Master, ignore her.

614
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,279
She's bringing

615
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
disgrace on herself.

616
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
Stop laughing.

617
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,839
Xia Meng,

618
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,000
it's okay.

619
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,799
Say it.

620
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,799
Let me share it with you.

621
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,640
Your happiness,

622
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,279
your happiness.

623
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,599
Don't be nervous.

624
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
Now, after work,

625
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,119
just treat me as your friend.

626
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,400
The boy who just got

627
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
in Mr. Du's car,

628
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,400
He's the new intern

629
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,279
in our department,

630
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,119
Hao Shuai.

631
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,400
Maybe Xia Meng

632
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,279
is not satisfied with

633
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,279
sharing a car with us.

634
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,759
Xia Meng likes that intern?

635
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,039
Mr. Yuan, don't listen to them.

636
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,599
The company doesn't allow office romance.

637
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,599
I know that.

638
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,000
I just think,

639
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,799
he's good-looking,

640
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
Are you okay after watching it for a long time?

641
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,200
But that's not

642
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,359
your attitude just now.

643
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,279
Love begets hate.

644
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,279
I just don't like

645
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,440
Gu Qiao.

646
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,279
There are so many cars,

647
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
but you have to take an intern

648
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,920
to grab Mr. Du's car,

649
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,759
Those who don't know

650
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,039
will think she's here for a blind date.

651
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,079
All right. Just kidding.

652
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,079
That's enough.

653
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,160
He's

654
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,400
a left-handed elite man,

655
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Handsome guy with right hand.

656
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,440
Who knows

657
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
what she's up to,

658
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm old,

659
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,759
but I don't have much professional ability,

660
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,000
And you're not serious.

661
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,680
Don't be mad.

662
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,839
That's right.

663
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,319
Mr. Du,

664
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,519
Miss Gu,

665
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,680
Have a drink with Mr. Du.

666
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,440
What should we drink?

667
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,759
Isn't this a drink

668
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,880
between subordinates and leaders?

669
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,440
Am I right?

670
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,480
Mr. Du, a toast to you.

671
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,200
Sit down.

672
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:48,880
Come on.

673
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,240
Cheers.

674
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,559
Look how amazing he is.

675
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,519
Cheers! Cheers!

676
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,640
Cheers!

677
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,559
Cheers! Cheers!

678
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,079
Come on,

679
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,480
Master, come on. Let's do it together.

680
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

681
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,559
I'm sorry to interrupt,

682
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,640
Mr. Du just said

683
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,759
he would treat us

684
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,839
to a full meal

685
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,359
before we go to sing together, okay?

686
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,000
That's great.

687
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,799
Mr. Du is awesome!

688
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,240
Come on. Before we all

689
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,079
get drunk,

690
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,799
Let's take a group photo first.

691
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,319
Okay.

692
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:16,960
Come on.

693
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,960
Let me take a picture.

694
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
-Leader. -Leader. Come

695
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,960
on.

696
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,519
Let's take a group photo.

697
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:20,960
Come on.

698
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,759
Leader,

699
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,519
come to the front, come to the front,

700
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Come on.

701
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,720
This way.

702
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,319
I'll stand this way.

703
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,079
Gu Qiao,

704
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,319
are you standing still?

705
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Are you ready?

706
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm ready.

707
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,039
Come on,

708
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:34,680
That's enough.

709
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,119
Three, two, one,

710
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,920
Shumei.

711
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,359
Come on,

712
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,480
Come here! Come here!

713
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,920
Let's play a game.

714
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,240
Truth or Dare.

715
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,160
Okay.

716
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,559
Come on.

717
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,799
Let me explain the rules.

718
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,559
Very simple.

719
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,680
Now we take a bottle,

720
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,400
idle it,

721
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
To whom?

722
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,079
That person has to choose the truth.

723
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:57,759
Or take a big risk?

724
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,000
But what I can't answer

725
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,839
is very simple,

726
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,039
Drink up a full glass,

727
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,359
okay?

728
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,319
Kill,

729
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:04,720
Come on,

730
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,640
Come on,

731
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,799
Come on,

732
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,920
Come on, have a seat.

733
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,079
Have a seat. Have a seat.

734
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Hurry up.

735
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,559
How about this?

736
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,119
Mr. Yuan leads you first,

737
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,440
Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yuan.

738
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,920
Mr. Yuan.

739
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,519
Mr. Du, Mr. Du, Mr. Du,

740
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,440
Mr. Du, Mr. Du,

741
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,839
Mr. Yuan, let me ask you a question.

742
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,599
Feel free to ask.

743
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,160
You can ask who you like?

744
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,960
Or have a sweetheart

745
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,319
or something like that.

746
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,599
You can ask

747
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,279
whatever you want.

748
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,279
Ask

749
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,440
Mr. Du.

750
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,359
Are you afraid of cockroaches?

751
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,759
I'm afraid.

752
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,279
Mr. Yuan,

753
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:55,920
Mr. Yuan,

754
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,200
It's not right for you to ask.

755
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,599
Come on,

756
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,680
You have to ask

757
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
tough questions next.

758
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,079
This kind of game is fun.

759
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,359
Next. Next.

760
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:02,720
Next! Next!

761
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,240
Let me do it.

762
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,680
Wang Mei, Wang Mei, Wang Mei,

763
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,200
Come on.

764
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,519
Hao Shuai,

765
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,440
let me ask you something,

766
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,880
What do you think

767
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,920
of

768
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Xia Meng?

769
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,880
-What are you doing? -How is it? Not

770
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,839
so good.

771
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,079
It's my turn.

772
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,480
Come and

773
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,559
have a look,

774
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't be angry.

775
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,519
Mr. Du,

776
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,759
Mr. Du, Mr. Du,

777
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,559
Mr. Du. Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

778
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,799
Come on. Let's ask questions

779
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,200
Come on,

780
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,519
Come on, it's your turn.

781
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,559
Big risk.

782
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,359
Big risk. You can

783
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,240
come. All of you are lesbians,

784
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,079
Pick one, look at each other

785
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,720
affectionately for 30 seconds,

786
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,359
What do you think?

787
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,400
-Gu Qiao. -Gu Qiao, Gu

788
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,440
Qiao has beautiful eyes.

789
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,279
Come on.

790
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Wait, wait, wait.

791
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
As for my coffee position,

792
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,079
it's not appropriate for me to look Mr. Du in the eye.

793
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,839
Well,

794
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,839
Mr. Yuan,

795
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,640
Mr. Yuan looks at each other,

796
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,599
which can also promote

797
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,799
your cooperation,

798
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,440
Come on.

799
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,960
One, two, three, go.

800
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,880
Master, don't be timid.

801
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,720
You're so useless.

802
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,319
Mr. Du got drunk

803
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,000
and dropped the ball at the critical moment,

804
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,599
Mr. Du,

805
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,920
you're drunk now.

806
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,559
Really?

807
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,759
Mr. Du hasn't had a few drinks.

808
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,920
Let's keep playing.

809
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,519
I'm going to answer the phone.

810
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,359
Okay,

811
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,000
How about this?

812
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,759
Let's continue the game.

813
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,119
Master,

814
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,680
who's next?

815
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,400
Come on,

816
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,079
turn it around. Let me do it.

817
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,039
Gu Qiao,

818
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:11,839
go ahead.

819
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,279
Be more exciting,

820
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,440
Gu Qiao.

821
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,480
I heard that you are the same age as Mr. Yuan,

822
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,160
working in the same company,

823
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,279
She's the vice president,

824
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,720
and you're just a newcomer.

825
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,000
How do you feel in your heart?

826
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,079
You'll still be disappointed.

827
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,000
But

828
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,359
I chose my own path,

829
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
-Then hang in

830
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,599
there. -Okay.

831
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,039
Come on,

832
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,599
Go, go,

833
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,240
go. Let me do it.

834
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,480
Good, good, good.

835
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,759
Why don't you turn around and just ask.

836
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,839
actually

837
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Don't you all have something

838
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,279
on your mind?

839
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,519
Do you want to use it as an excuse?

840
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,400
Xia Meng,

841
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,519
are you drunk?

842
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,000
Then take it as I'm drunk.

843
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,599
Gu Qiao,

844
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to ask you a few questions.

845
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,319
Sure. Go ahead.

846
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,640
Tonight,

847
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,160
didn't you whisper to Mr. Du,

848
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,720
I was flirting with Hao Shuai.

849
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,640
What do you want to do?

850
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,519
An employee who can stay in Shumei.

851
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,400
Everyone speaks

852
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,480
according to their professional ability,

853
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
You think

854
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,840
you're fawning on the leader,

855
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,800
If you betray your appearance,

856
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,719
you'll be able to climb up.

857
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,400
Also,

858
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,000
I know.

859
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,320
You don't like Hao Shuai at all.

860
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,000
Don't flirt with her

861
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,159
if you don't like her, okay?

862
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,760
Do you have any sense of shame?

863
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,079
Xia Meng.

864
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,480
Xia Meng,

865
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,360
if I have any problems

866
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
at work,

867
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,960
You can say anything about me,

868
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,119
as long as you're right,

869
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,719
I'm willing to change and learn.

870
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,880
Even if you don't like me,

871
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,679
and dislike me before and after others,

872
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,880
I can put up with it.

873
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,079
However,

874
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,800
you can't create rumors and cause trouble.

875
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
You insulted my character.

876
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,320
Got it?

877
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,679
Am I wrong?

878
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,440
Mr. Yuan kindly asked Manager Zheng to take you,

879
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,760
did Manager Zheng treat you badly?

880
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,159
And you're flirting with Mr. Du.

881
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,280
You just want to seduce him.

882
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,360
Why are you pretending in front of me?

883
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,920
Xia Meng,

884
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,960
say something more.

885
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,440
I'm talking about you today. What's wrong?

886
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,239
I'll talk about you if it's enough.

887
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
Do you dare to say one more word to me?

888
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,559
That's enough.

889
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,760
Are you done?

890
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,159
All right, don't be mad.

891
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,559
Xia Meng,

892
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,440
let me answer your question.

893
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
Gu Qiao is my best friend,

894
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,239
we've known each other since childhood,

895
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,679
We studied together,

896
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,840
came to Shanghai together,

897
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,280
Mr. Du and I went to college together,

898
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,800
not the kind of relationship you mentioned.

899
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,719
If you're curious about her,

900
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,920
I can tell you,

901
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,199
Ever since I was a kid,

902
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,880
Gu Qiao

903
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,800
has always been very kind,

904
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,039
More importantly,

905
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,480
she has always been an upright person.

906
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,000
Xia Meng, let me remind you,

907
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,360
in Shu Mei,

908
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,519
Colleagues should live in harmony.

909
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,920
It's not a conspiracy.

910
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,039
Do you know

911
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,719
what I hate the most

912
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,480
about pushing each other out?

913
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,360
As a woman,

914
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,480
you even stigmatized other women.

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
I have something to do. I'll go now.

916
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:11,800
Master.

917
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,639
Where's Mr. Fu?

918
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,199
He's in there.

919
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,079
Ge Zi,

920
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,719
that's the music box

921
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,840
I told you before

922
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,400
that Baona wanted the most

923
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,360
when she was eight years old,

924
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,559
Later,

925
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,840
I went to see the boss.

926
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,400
He said it has been discontinued.

927
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,880
Later,

928
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,239
I went to Guangzhou on a business trip.

929
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,639
All of a sudden,

930
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,599
I was at a stall,

931
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,360
Seeing this music box,

932
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,559
I'm so happy.

933
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,159
So I bought it right away.

934
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm going to take it home

935
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,599
as a surprise for Baona.

936
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,360
I didn't expect to come home.

937
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,119
I just saw a letter

938
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,760
her dad left me,

939
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,800
The letter said.

940
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,960
They left for a foreign country

941
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,639
and never came back.

942
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,599
Ge Zi.

943
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,199
I've never

944
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,719
regretted it.

945
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,719
I've never felt like

946
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,719
I was a failure.

947
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
Although

948
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,760
I did lose my marriage,

949
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:27,920
but,

950
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,519
I realized my dream.

951
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,559
I also have

952
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,800
a lovely daughter.

953
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,239
But I just found out today.

954
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,079
I was wrong.

955
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,760
What's wrong with Baona?

956
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,880
As you know,

957
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,960
at this time of year,

958
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,280
Her dad

959
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,639
will send her back.

960
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,400
Stay with me for a while.

961
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,639
That is, every year,

962
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,039
this period of time

963
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,920
is the time I look forward to the most

964
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,400
and feel the happiest in the year.

965
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,559
I always thought

966
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,400
Baona felt the same way,

967
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,079
I just found out today

968
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,079
that it's not like this.

969
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,719
Just a few hours ago,

970
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,440
she called me.

971
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,039
Do you know

972
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,719
what she told me?

973
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,519
She said

974
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
she was 18 years old,

975
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,800
As an adult,

976
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
there are some things,

977
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,320
She can make her own decision.

978
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,920
So she doesn't want to

979
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,360
disobey my arrangement anymore.

980
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,880
And she also told me,

981
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,199
all the happiness

982
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,920
she had with me before.

983
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Actually, it's all acting.

984
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,480
She hates me.

985
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,880
She always hates me.

986
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,159
She never wants to

987
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,559
come back to me again.

988
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,159
You know what?

989
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,519
I have nothing left.
