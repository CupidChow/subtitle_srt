1
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,280
What do you mean

2
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,239
by your sister-in-law?

3
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,519
I don't know.

4
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
I heard that Mr. Fu

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,280
is quite against office romance.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,200
I think sister-in-law

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560
is trying to avoid suspicion, right?

8
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,400
And you two are in such high positions,

9
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,680
what will Mr. Fu do if she finds out?

10
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,920
What should I do?

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,519
At worst, I'll resign.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,000
Good for you.

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,200
Well,

14
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,359
I think you should ask your sister-in-law

15
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,560
out for dinner,

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's be clear.

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,960
You think I didn't have an appointment?

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
She rejected me

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
for all kinds of reasons.

20
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,000
How about this?

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
Gu Qiao asks us all out

22
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,879
for dinner tomorrow,

23
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,159
Let me help you find out.

24
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,800
Stop it.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
Gu Qiao has told me

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
everything she knows.

27
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,919
I don't think so.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,879
I have a special relationship with her.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,919
What do you mean?

30
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,520
It's not interesting.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,719
Yanxi,

32
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,000
do you know why Gu Qiao

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
invited us to dinner today?

34
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,039
I don't know.

35
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,879
If it weren't for Hao Shuai,

36
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,039
I wouldn't have come.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,479
I'm tired of Japanese food.

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,120
When Gu Qiao comes later,

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,599
don't say that.

40
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,280
About what happened last time,

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,759
she didn't argue with you at all.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
For today's meal,

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,439
take it as a settlement

44
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,080
and don't bring it up again.

45
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,439
Yeon-hee,

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
you have a good temper,

47
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,159
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,719
Welcome.

49
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,199
The traffic is too heavy.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,280
You came together?

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. We didn't

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,599
meet at the door.

53
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,039
Have you ordered?

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm not waiting for you.

55
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,680
Waitress menu

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,719
Coming

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,599
This seat,

58
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,159
suddenly, I feel a little uncomfortable.

59
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,599
Let me change.

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,159
Here you are.

61
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,439
What do you want to eat?

62
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,159
Order whatever you want.

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,719
Gu Qiao, order it. It's my treat.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,719
You guys have some.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,879
Who will order?

66
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,879
I'll have

67
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,240
two Arctic shellfish,

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
Okay,

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,919
two portions of salmon,

70
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,159
Hao Shuai, what would you like to eat?

71
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,879
Let me order it for you.

72
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,639
I don't need it now.

73
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,199
One more bottle of Rex Sacrifice. No,

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
no, no. I don't want any more in front of me.

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
I think

76
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,039
the 1998 set meal is good,

77
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,879
That's it.

78
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,520
Isn't Wang Mei on a diet?

79
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll lose weight after this meal.

80
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,159
Gu Qiao, do you mind?

81
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,199
I don't mind. It's okay.

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
By the way, Gu Qiao,

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,879
you didn't suddenly want to

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,120
treat us to dinner today.

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,759
The last time

86
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,960
we got together,

87
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,199
Aren't you unhappy

88
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,680
because of me?

89
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,879
I want to say that

90
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,240
you haven't been so busy lately.

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's just have a meal together.

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,280
By the way, thank you

93
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
for taking care of me during this time,

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
You're leaving?

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,480
To be precise, it should be a transfer.

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,720
Transfer?

97
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,879
Why didn't I know?

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,759
Gu Qiao,

99
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,759
which department are you transferring to?

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,879
Brand department,

101
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,720
but I'm not sure yet.

102
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,160
Let's congratulate you in advance.

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,639
I don't have any wine.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
Let's use tea instead of the bar

105
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,160
to congratulate him.

106
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,079
Cheers!

107
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,120
Congratulations, Gu Qiao.

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,800
Xia Meng,

109
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,519
congratulations, Gu Qiao.

110
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,160
Thank you.

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Congratulations,

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,319
Congratulations.

113
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,279
What's going on?

114
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
Have you found out?

115
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,439
What did Gu Qiao say?

116
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm telling you,

117
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm very happy today.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,319
From now on, we'll get together often,

119
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,240
no matter which department I go to,

120
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,399
We're going to

121
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,800
drink together a lot,

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Okay?

123
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,759
I've already

124
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,279
paid the bill.

125
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,160
Everyone should eat happily.

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,959
Cheers!

127
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,680
Cheers! Cheers!

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Cheers! Cheers!

129
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,199
Don't drink too much,

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,360
Gu Qiao. It's okay.

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,879
Gu Qiao, my car is here.

132
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,079
How about I take you home?

133
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,959
No need.

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm not drunk.

135
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,759
-It's okay. -Let me see you off.

136
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,920
-Yes. -Take her

137
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,639
home.

138
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,279
I'm telling you,

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,079
Yanxi's house is too far away,

140
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,120
Okay, okay.

141
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,160
If Hao Shuai takes me home,

142
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,879
remember to take her home.

143
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,120
The bus is here. I'm leaving.

144
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
Send me a WeChat message when you get home,

145
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,519
Okay,

146
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:01,920
-Goodbye. -Goodbye, Yanxi.

147
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Goodbye.

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,079
Stop drinking.

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Hao Shuai,

150
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,279
I'm calling a designated driver.

151
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,160
Let me send you home.

152
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,160
No, no, no.

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,920
Xia Meng,

154
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,759
drop me off.

155
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,639
I'll go to the subway station.

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,040
Don't stop me.

157
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,759
Well,

158
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,439
Well

159
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,959
See Wang Mei off.

160
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,240
She drank so much,

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,639
so send her home.

162
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,639
I'm not drunk.

163
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,519
-Let's go. -Let's go. -Let's

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,360
go.

165
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,879
Sis, let's go.

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,759
The bus is here.

167
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm not leaving.

168
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,199
Let's go.

169
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,800
You're drunk again.

170
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
Okay, okay. Come on.

171
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,759
I'll get up by myself. Don't help me.

172
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,680
I know taekwondo.

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
I'll beat you up.

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,800
Okay, okay, it's okay.

175
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,759
Sis,

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,480
Let me know when you get home.

177
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,439
Go, go, go, go,

178
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,360
Be careful.

179
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,120
Goodbye.

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
Goodbye.

181
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,199
No.

182
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,199
-Let's go. -Let's go.

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Be careful.

184
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Xia Meng, let's go.

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't help me.

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
-Please take care. -Okay, let's

187
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,399
go.

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,199
Don't be angry.

189
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,240
Me,

190
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,439
Maybe you can

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,959
find someone else to like.

192
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,240
He really doesn't suit you.

193
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Look at him in the company,

194
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,160
fawning on Mr. Du and Mr. Yuan,

195
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,279
Forget it.

196
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,319
He … He doesn't even spare Mr. Yuan's best

197
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,800
friend,

198
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Are you talking about someone else?

199
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,839
Me

200
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,519
I bought you a meal of Japanese food.

201
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
Go back on your own.

202
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,120
Me,

203
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,079
Xia

204
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
Xia Meng.

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,199
What a waste.

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,439
Waiter,

207
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,759
pack these for me.

208
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,759
Open the door

209
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
We're home.

210
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,839
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

211
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,759
I'll sue you

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
for harassment. Be careful. Be careful.

213
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Watch out!

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,839
Hello, Mr. Yuan,

215
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,120
Gu Qiao,

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,079
I'm an intern in the company.

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,879
Miss Gu is drunk,

218
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,680
I'll send her back.

219
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,360
Ge Ge, I miss you.

220
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,839
Be careful.

221
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,279
Be careful.

222
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,839
Slow down. I'm fine.

223
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,199
I said I'm fine.

224
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,319
Be careful.

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,839
Don't help me.

226
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
What is this? Get up.

227
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,879
I can stand still.

228
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,680
Let go.

229
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,240
Leave it to me.

230
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,480
Go back and rest early.

231
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,360
Let me help you.

232
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,399
No need.

233
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Be careful.

234
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Are you happy?

235
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,240
I can walk.

236
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,039
-Really? -Take a

237
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,559
good look.

238
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Let me hold you.

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,519
Okay, let me help you.

240
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,519
It's okay. I can walk.

241
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,879
I know this is my bed.

242
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,440
Look, I can still lie down.

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,039
Look,

244
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,919
I can sleep on my own.

245
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,440
Go to bed.

246
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Cover me with something,

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm cold.

248
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,879
Ge Ge is good.

249
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,039
I'll get you a glass of water.

250
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,639
Okay.

251
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,759
Would you like some water?

252
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,559
No need.

253
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,919
Mr. Yuan,

254
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,840
can I use the bathroom?

255
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
-It can be here. -Okay. Thank

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,440
you.

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,759
Hey,

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,600
Guess where I am?

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
It doesn't matter where you are.

260
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,360
Have you forgotten

261
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,159
what I told you?

262
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,720
I didn't forget.

263
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,039
I'm in the toilet.

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,759
Then why did you call me

265
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,960
and ask me to bring you some paper.

266
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,120
If I'm not in Mr. Yuan's toilet,

267
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,639
which Mr. Yuan?

268
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
My sister-in-law Yuan Ge.

269
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Hao Shuai.

270
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Hao Shuai, are you ready?

271
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,519
Hao Shuai, are you okay?

272
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm fine.

273
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,720
The paper is gone.

274
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,720
Wait a minute.

275
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,440
I'll get it for you.

276
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,279
Okay.

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,559
Hao Shuai,

278
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,159
how about this,

279
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
You open the door a little bit,

280
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,240
and then I turn around,

281
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,399
Then I'll pass it to you.

282
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay,

283
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,519
I'll open it.

284
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,279
Okay.

285
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,559
All right,

286
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,919
thank you, Mr. Yuan.

287
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
I turned it off.

288
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,519
Hurry up.

289
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
What are you doing with one eye?

290
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,240
Hey,

291
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,960
Where are you?

292
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,519
I can't hold on any longer.

293
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,720
I got it.

294
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,440
We'll be there soon.

295
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,440
Hurry up.

296
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,000
While the gelada is doing this,

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,559
let's go, let's go,

298
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,840
And you keep nagging,

299
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,799
like this,

300
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,320
While your hands are busy,

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,279
you can also do well in interpersonal relationships.

302
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,360
Hao Shuai,

303
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,879
how are you?

304
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,399
Are you okay?

305
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,200
It's okay, Mr. Yuan.

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,279
Me

307
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,039
It seems that the wine is getting stronger.

308
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,879
Me

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,799
I'm still not feeling well.

310
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,879
We need to slow it down a little bit.

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,679
Well,

312
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,159
Then why did you call me if you need anything?

313
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,720
Who is it?

314
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,080
Why are you here?

315
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,399
I'm here to pick up my cousin.

316
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,559
Hao Shuai is your cousin?

317
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Where is he?

318
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,120
He's drunk. He's in the bathroom.

319
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,000
Come in.

320
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,039
On the left,

321
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,639
This one

322
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,679
Why are you drinking so much? Hurry up.

323
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,879
Why is it so slow?

324
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Brother,

325
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,960
where have you been?

326
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,919
I took a taxi

327
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,120
because I drank a little wine,

328
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,759
When you go back this time,

329
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,840
you have to give me two bottles.

330
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,360
Two bottles of my 14-year-old

331
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,919
brother,

332
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,639
Thank you for your hard work.

333
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,799
Stay here for a while.

334
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,559
Of course.

335
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,919
I'll go.

336
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,480
Come on!

337
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
He drank too much.

338
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,720
Let him stay inside for a while.

339
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
What are you doing?

340
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,039
I'll make some sobriety soup,

341
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,639
and let him finish it before he leaves.

342
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,440
You need ginger in the sober soup.

343
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you have any?

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,919
It's gone.

345
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
I think they're all used up.

346
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,200
Give me

347
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,919
that yellow thing.

348
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,799
Gu Qiao usually cooks,

349
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
but I seldom go into the kitchen,

350
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,080
You've spent all your energy

351
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,159
on your work.

352
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,039
That's normal.

353
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,720
You seem to be

354
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,200
avoiding me lately.

355
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,159
No.

356
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,600
No.

357
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
Am I right?

358
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,320
I'll transfer Gu Qiao to my place.

359
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,159
Are you unhappy?

360
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,840
No.

361
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,039
At that time, I just thought,

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,399
she wanted to use your relationship

363
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,480
to take a shortcut.

364
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,200
You don't have to think too much.

365
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,279
She has always been

366
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,000
a hard worker,

367
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,720
I just think,

368
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,759
she can't show her talents

369
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,480
in the marketing department.

370
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
That's why she was transferred

371
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,519
to my place.

372
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,599
She told me

373
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,279
that day.

374
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
Both of you are the same.

375
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,319
Every time you talk about each other,

376
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,960
you are very cautious.

377
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,240
Sometimes I envy you.

378
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
Who are you envious of?

379
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,319
My brother and Mr. Yuan are outside.

380
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,960
Why is your brother here?

381
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,000
Me

382
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,960
What are you looking at? Look.

383
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,119
Gu Qiao,

384
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,240
why are you so young?

385
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,480
Call me sister.

386
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,720
Gu Qiao, I like you.

387
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,559
I said,

388
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,240
I like you.

389
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,079
Are you crazy?

390
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,880
It's a sin.

391
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,799
What's wrong?

392
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,880
If it's wrong to like someone,

393
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,839
you can't just kiss him.

394
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,680
Isn't that

395
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,400
where your emotions are?

396
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,119
Who wouldn't kiss?

397
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,960
Then, do you think

398
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,839
you and Gu Qiao are suitable?

399
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,720
What's wrong?

400
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,799
What era is it now?

401
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,200
You're still talking about your age,

402
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,839
okay, okay,

403
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,799
Then tell me,

404
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,759
what do you like about her?

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,519
Do you need a reason to like someone?

406
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,359
Don't you need it?

407
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
What do you like about Mr. Yuan?

408
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
Look. You don't know.

409
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,119
You're still talking about me,

410
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,039
you know,

411
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,680
They're best friends,

412
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,440
and we're brothers.

413
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,839
Aren't we going to get even closer

414
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
when we're together?

415
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,000
Isn't that great?

416
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,640
You're an adult now.

417
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,400
Can you not be so childish?

418
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay,

419
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,920
Let me show you something mature.

420
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,240
Let me ask you something,

421
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,799
Is it Yuan Ge Da,

422
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,440
or Gu Qiao Da

423
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,880
Gu Qiao Da,

424
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,799
A few months older,

425
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,640
a few months older,

426
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,000
Think about it

427
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,839
What about me?

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,640
If you make it with Gu Qiao,

429
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,160
do you have to call me

430
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
brother-in-law?

431
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,359
brother-in-law

432
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,599
Master, don't listen to him.

433
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,599
Du Bingwen.

434
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,039
Du Bingwen.

435
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
This hangover soup is still hot. Remember

436
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
to drink it later.

437
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,039
Hao Shuai

438
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,559
is Du Bingwen's cousin.

439
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,160
Why didn't you tell me?

440
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,960
What's there to say?

441
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,079
Or you know,

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,640
he's your future cousin.

443
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,319
I want to be nice to him.

444
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,519
No,

445
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,000
I said

446
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,559
What's going on between you and him?

447
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,680
What can I do?

448
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,240
He's just a kid.

449
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Isn't that what kids do?

450
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,920
I like the usual meal

451
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
I hate tomorrow today.

452
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,359
It's okay.

453
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,000
If you're in the company every day,

454
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,920
It's not awkward to see him when he looks up

455
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,359
and doesn't look down.

456
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,720
It's not awkward.

457
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm different from you.

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,799
I don't like him.

459
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,440
In my heart,

460
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,240
he's just a naughty little brother,

461
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,839
But Du Bingwen and you,

462
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,000
what are you talking about

463
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,880
in the kitchen?

464
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,680
What can we talk about?

465
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,599
Nothing.

466
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,039
Nothing.

467
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean,

468
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,119
are you two going to be

469
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,240
in love or not?

470
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,480
Have you made it clear?

471
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,400
We're really not in a relationship,

472
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
we were just

473
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,119
talking about your transfer?

474
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,519
Tell me,

475
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
I'll tell you,

476
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,519
He even moved his cousin out.

477
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,319
I put on such a big show

478
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,599
for you here.

479
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,720
I just want to see you.

480
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,200
Let me be clear with you.

481
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,039
You two are talking about me?

482
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,480
He started it first.

483
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,680
You two are perfect for each other.

484
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,519
But you don't have to admit it.

485
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,880
What about you now?

486
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,319
I have fallen in love

487
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,279
with him.

488
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,319
You don't have to make a death struggle,

489
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,559
but when Du Erer

490
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,839
went to college,

491
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,319
You rejected her once.

492
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,240
If you refuse him again this time,

493
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
if he really runs away,

494
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,440
What are you going to do?

495
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
And when it comes to love,

496
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,359
you have to talk about it

497
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,039
when you're young and when you're middle-aged,

498
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,559
It's always

499
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,279
so close,

500
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,039
Alright, Miss Gu.

501
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:24,799
What about

502
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,079
your romance class today?

503
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,000
Let's stop here.

504
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,359
I'm going to take a shower.

505
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,319
Take a shower.

506
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,440
Didn't you just take a shower?

507
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,960
Wash it again.

508
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Just now, you made me smell like alcohol,

509
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,319
but your words were harsh.

510
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,119
You brat,

511
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,279
how dare you kiss me?

512
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,200
Let's see how I'll deal with him.

513
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,400
Mr. Xiong,

514
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,839
what about the next time,

515
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,480
If you have time,

516
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,920
I'll take you to our factory.

517
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,720
Look at our current production line.

518
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
By the way, Mr. Xiong,

519
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,119
what sports do you like?

520
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,039
Let's play golf. Maybe

521
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,880
we can play golf in the future,

522
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:21,960
Let's talk about business.

523
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:22,920
Okay.

524
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Let's make an appointment later.

525
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,640
Gu Qiao,

526
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,640
what are you doing?

527
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,400
About what I said yesterday,

528
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,000
what do you think about it?

529
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,200
Can you shut up?

530
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm serious.

531
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,519
I'm telling you,

532
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,279
I haven't settled yesterday's account with you yet.

533
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,400
No,

534
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,559
I'm counting on you.

535
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,799
Okay, let's talk next time.

536
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,519
Okay. Thank you.

537
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:53,920
Goodbye.

538
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,680
Goodbye.

539
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,519
What's wrong?

540
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,839
I'm telling you,

541
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,559
what happened yesterday,

542
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
What happened yesterday,

543
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,319
if you dare to mention it again,

544
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,200
We can't even be friends.

545
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,680
We won't be friends from now on.

546
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,680
Got it?

547
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,160
Gu Qiao, come here.

548
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm here.

549
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,160
Don't tell me.

550
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,039
Mr. Du, what can I do for you?

551
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
From today on,

552
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,480
you're officially

553
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,400
my assistant.

554
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,319
As for Guangke,

555
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,160
I'll send you there.

556
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,519
Me,

557
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,920
But I don't have much experience.

558
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,000
What if I can't handle it?

559
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,240
No, I won't.

560
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,359
We've signed the contract.

561
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,279
Guangke is a big company.

562
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,240
We won't cheat.

563
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,000
But I've never done a job

564
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,960
like this before,

565
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,559
It's very simple.

566
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,559
Just think of yourself

567
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,519
as a consumer

568
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,640
and give them advice.

569
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,680
Where's the product this time?

570
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
It's different from

571
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,319
Shu Mei's previous products.

572
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,519
I don't want to send anyone else.

573
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,559
Bring the aesthetics

574
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,079
of the past

575
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,279
to our product,

576
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,799
What about you?

577
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,319
I know a lot about high-end skin care products.

578
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,480
I have faith in you.

579
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,160
Okay,

580
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,680
Then I'll give it a try.

581
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,039
Come on!

582
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,480
Thank you, boss. I came back

583
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,160
after walking.

584
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,000
What else can I do for you, boss?

585
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,480
There's something personal.

586
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,599
Personal?

587
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,559
Tell me,

588
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,359
as soon as Yuan Ge arrives at the company,

589
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,160
He's so cold to me.

590
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,880
How can I get along with her?

591
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,799
It's a man.

592
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,440
When it's time to be tough,

593
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,400
you have to be tough.

594
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,279
Ge Ge is good at everything.

595
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,799
But when it comes to relationships,

596
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,200
she doesn't understand.

597
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,319
So you can't

598
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,319
follow her rhythm at all,

599
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,240
What should I do?

600
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,920
Can you bring her

601
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,039
into my rhythm?

602
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,519
Use your brain

603
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,319
and watch more idol dramas.

604
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,680
What idol drama?

605
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,400
The domineering boss is in love with me.

606
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,440
Yanxi,

607
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,400
I was supposed to

608
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,359
deal with the advertising company,

609
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,640
You've been doing it all the time,

610
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,920
but now it's all Gu Qiao's fault,

611
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,119
Isn't she just trying to

612
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,400
get to know Mr. Yuan and Mr. Du?

613
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,359
Before that,

614
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,039
I was working directly with the advertising company.

615
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,880
It's because the company doesn't have a brand department,

616
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,839
but now it does.

617
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,680
Mr. Du should have

618
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,880
sent someone to meet him directly,

619
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,599
Forget it if it's someone else.

620
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,000
She doesn't even know

621
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,839
how to use a spreadsheet.

622
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,720
Why would she do that?

623
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,680
It's getting late.

624
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,759
Go home and do it.

625
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,440
It's okay. Go home first.

626
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,599
I'm in a good state now.

627
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,799
I'm afraid I'll be sleepy again when I get home.

628
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,400
I'll wait for you.

629
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,599
Let's go back.

630
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm not a kid.

631
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,519
I'm under pressure when you're here.

632
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
Look at the back of this one. Yes,

633
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,200
this one is to

634
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
put it on top.

635
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,680
And then?

636
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,799
Let's turn the page

637
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,960
and look at the purple one,

638
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,599
Find two purple

639
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,119
sisters,

640
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,759
When are you going to have a holiday?

641
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,160
What's wrong?

642
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,559
I want you to come with me to find mom.

643
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,920
Then.

644
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,599
Ling Ling, do you know where mom is?

645
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
I don't know.

646
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,079
Dad only said that

647
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,160
mom went to

648
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,000
work far away.

649
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,640
Well,

650
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,599
I'll ask your dad now.

651
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,200
Where is your mom?

652
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
Then I'll take you there, okay?

653
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,640
Okay.

654
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,519
Then stay here and do your best.

655
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,799
I'll come to see you later.

656
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,359
Be good.

657
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,480
Here's the thing, Mr. Xiong.

658
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,519
Ling Ling kept asking me to take her

659
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,440
to see her mother.

660
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,839
But I don't know the address.

661
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,440
If it's inconvenient for you,

662
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,480
You can give me the address.

663
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,680
I'll take Ling Ling,

664
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,319
Miss Gu.

665
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,319
Why are you doing this?

666
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,319
Indeed, in this matter,

667
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,839
I didn't ask for your permission,

668
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,839
I'm sorry,

669
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,480
but I've promised Ling Ling.

670
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,519
Take her to see her mother.

671
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,160
Miss Gu,

672
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,720
do you know my family?

673
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,880
Do you know why

674
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,160
I didn't bring Ling Ling to see her?

675
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,880
You know, making decisions

676
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,839
without the consent of others,

677
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,759
What kind of consequences

678
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,880
will it bring to us?

679
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,599
I really … I don't know.

680
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,240
What happened to your family?

681
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,119
I don't know,

682
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,160
between you two adults,

683
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,079
I don't have any grudges,

684
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:47,880
but I think,

685
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,640
She's still young.

686
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,720
She's innocent.

687
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,359
You can't stop

688
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,480
Ling Ling from going to see her.

689
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,559
Don't you think it's selfish of you

690
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
to do so?

691
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,759
This is my family matter.

692
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
You don't have to interfere.

693
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,119
You keep saying that you love Ling Ling,

694
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,839
but are you

695
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,240
a good father?

696
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Miss Gu,

697
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,279
you don't have to work so hard

698
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,119
to set up

699
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,640
a sincere person like you, okay?

700
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,359
After all,

701
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,839
you're so nice to Ling Ling,

702
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Is your motive simple?

703
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,160
What do you mean?

704
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,799
If not,

705
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,119
you, an employee of Shumei,

706
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,799
You used Ling Ling as an excuse

707
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,599
to stop me at the airport,

708
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,079
He also told me

709
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,720
a lot of things about you and your best friend,

710
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,400
If I'm not mistaken,

711
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,039
Yuan Ge is your best friend.

712
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,799
Right?

713
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,519
Me

714
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,200
I did hide it from you.

715
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,119
But you don't have to explain.

716
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,319
There are some things

717
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,839
that can't be saved by explanation.

718
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
You don't have to come again.

719
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,559
I just want Ling Ling to see her.

720
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,559
What's wrong with that?

721
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,519
If he has his reasons,

722
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,440
he can tell us.

723
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,200
He didn't say anything,

724
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,519
so he scolded me like this.

725
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,599
I'm still full of anger.

726
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,680
Where should I send it?

727
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,480
How can there be

728
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,519
such a person in this world?

729
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
All right. Why

730
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,880
are you angry?

731
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
maybe

732
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,519
Does he have something to hide?

733
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,880
What can he hide?

734
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,279
Don't speak for him.

735
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
I didn't speak for him.

736
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,799
I just want to

737
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,759
analyze it objectively for you,

738
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,400
I don't need you to analyze it objectively now,

739
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
I'm telling you,

740
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Ling Ling is so introverted,

741
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
a large part of it is because of him.

742
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,200
Well,

743
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,160
where's the tutor anyway,

744
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,319
I didn't do it for long.

745
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,799
You keep a distance from him in the future,

746
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,480
but I don't keep a distance now,

747
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,960
No way.

748
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,160
He knows I lied to him.

749
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,599
No,

750
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,200
he saw you in Shumei.

751
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,839
That's right.

752
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,759
Do you think this person is strange?

753
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,119
He saw me.

754
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,920
Pretend you didn't see it.

755
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,640
Tell me,

756
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,079
isn't he too scheming?

757
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,720
That's good.

758
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:10,799
I didn't want you

759
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,119
to get too close to him.

760
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,720
I like you.

761
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,440
I'm a man.

762
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,920
Brother,

763
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,039
I really can't do it.

764
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,519
What? You can't.

765
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,160
I'm practicing. It's not like I'm a real relative.

766
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,000
No, I just fell out of love.

767
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,599
You,

768
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,039
If you don't comfort me,

769
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,559
you ask me to practice this.

770
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,440
What is it?

771
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm sorry.

772
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,960
Let me comfort you first.

773
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,720
I feel sorry for you.

774
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,400
Just do it

775
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,759
Du Bingwen I'm telling you,

776
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,400
Your performance

777
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,519
is not touching.

778
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,920
If I were anyone,

779
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,960
I would definitely reject you.

780
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,200
Dream on.

781
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,400
What's wrong with you?

782
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,160
No problem.

783
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,799
I like you.

784
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,960
Thank you.

785
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
It doesn't matter.

786
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,599
Well,

787
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,159
you can do it according to this.

788
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,519
Okay,

789
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,079
Go ahead.

790
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,840
Okay.

791
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,880
Bear.

792
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
Please take care of me.

793
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,039
Please take care of me.

794
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,480
What does Miss Gu's plan

795
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,679
mean?

796
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,199
I made this.

797
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,440
Li Meng's publicity plan,

798
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,599
I think, is more in line

799
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,000
with Li Meng's current needs,

800
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,199
Of course,

801
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:14,800
I also referred to

802
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,119
some successful cases

803
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,280
of international high-end skin care products,

804
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,119
You can take a look,

805
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
and then we'll continue the discussion.

806
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,159
Every year, there's this kind of local dad

807
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,960
who doesn't know how to pretend to know,

808
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,840
Yeah,

809
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,360
or this kind of assistant?

810
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,800
You're so shameless that

811
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,119
you don't even know how to command me.

812
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,119
How should I carry out my work?

813
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,960
It's my plan.

814
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,880
Is there a problem?

815
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Miss Gu's plan

816
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
is very good.

817
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,159
It's obvious that you've done

818
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,840
a lot of preparation work,

819
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,440
But as you said,

820
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,239
your proposal refers to

821
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,039
the top international skin care

822
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,559
products resources,

823
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,360
No matter how hard it is,

824
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,840
Guangke can handle it.

825
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,440
But is your budget

826
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,960
worth it?

827
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,719
I suggest that

828
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
you ask your leader

829
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,079
for instructions.

830
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,199
Dismiss the meeting.

831
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,679
Miss Gu, what's the matter?

832
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,039
Actually, I just joined Shu Mei,

833
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,039
and this is my first time

834
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,960
working with an advertising company,

835
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,920
I don't have much experience,

836
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,159
so,

837
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,360
I don't have many ideas.

838
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,199
Thank you for pointing out my problem.

839
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,000
In fact, as Party A,

840
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,039
you only need to put the needs of the leaders,

841
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,719
Communicate it to Guangke

842
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
accurately. Guangke

843
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,159
will help you implement it.

844
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,719
You just need to

845
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,519
supervise the execution.

846
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,199
Of course,

847
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,440
if Party A knows more,

848
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,719
When Party B gets to work,

849
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,760
it'll be easier.

850
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,079
It doesn't matter. It

851
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,159
needs a process.

852
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,119
Take your time.

853
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,199
Thank you.

854
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,199
I think I'll have a lot

855
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,400
to ask you in the future,

856
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,000
Just don't think I'm annoying.

857
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,519
How could it be?

858
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,159
I'll leave if you get back to work.

859
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,239
I'm calling everyone

860
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,880
for a meeting today.

861
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,800
I want to discuss with you,

862
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,920
about the pre-sale of Li's Mansion,

863
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,199
What about me?

864
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,480
Open the pre-sale of Li's Mansion

865
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,559
one week in advance,

866
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,599
Let's see how it works first.

867
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,960
We can go online

868
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,280
before it's officially launched,

869
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
If you find any problem,

870
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,679
you can solve it in time.

871
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,280
If you pre-sell it in advance,

872
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,440
put the ads over there,

873
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,719
I need to talk to Guangke first,

874
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,000
but I don't think

875
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,039
it's a big problem.

876
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,960
Li Meng's official website

877
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,039
has been put into trial operation.

878
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,480
One week in advance will be fine.

879
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,639
Zhang Wei,

880
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,679
have you got

881
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,519
the facial mask survey data?

882
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,880
Isn't there

883
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,800
any data that is so difficult?

884
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,639
Mr. Yuan,

885
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,719
Li Yuan and Shu Mei,

886
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,239
And now that Mr. Liu is on leave again,

887
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,679
I'm really a little busy.

888
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,039
The function of a department head

889
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,880
is to arrange everything.

890
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,599
If Zhang Wei, you can't do it,

891
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,199
I believe there should be many people in the company

892
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,000
who want to replace you.

893
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,320
Zhang Wei,

894
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,760
if I give you three days,

895
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Can you make it?

896
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,840
Sure,

897
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:50,880
Okay,

898
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,639
Three days, then.

899
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,960
If we can't do it,

900
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,880
we'll change people.

901
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,159
Mr. Fu,

902
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,079
about recycling fake masks,

903
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,000
We can't put it off any longer.

904
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:00,880
Ge Zi,

905
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,039
I think about this matter,

906
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,960
You're too cautious.

907
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,440
In fact, when it comes

908
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,519
to recycling,

909
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,000
I don't think it's urgent.

910
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,559
The most important thing now,

911
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,519
is to race against time

912
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,760
for the listing of Li Juncheng.

913
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,039
As you know,

914
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,159
the market of skin care products

915
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,400
is changing rapidly.

916
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,039
We must take the initiative

917
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,000
this time

918
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,280
in our own hands,

919
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,960
Bingwen, what do you think?

920
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Objectively speaking,

921
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,199
what Mr. Fu and Mr. Yuan

922
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,920
said makes sense.

923
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,519
But things are prioritized,

924
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,920
I think the most urgent task now,

925
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,360
It's about solving Li Juncheng's

926
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,280
problem first,

927
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,960
Mr. Du,

928
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,679
do you also act like this

929
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,000
when you're abroad?

930
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,039
Mr. Fu, let's wait for another three days.

931
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,599
Okay, just three days.

932
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,440
What are you doing?

933
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,119
I won't do my homework today.

934
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,119
What homework?

935
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,119
Exaggerated confession.

936
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,639
I like you.

937
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm not in the mood to be mean with you today.

938
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,119
Why are we so miserable?

939
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,159
I'm handsome

940
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,480
and you're not ugly,

941
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,360
I'm smart,

942
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,480
and you're not rustic,

943
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,840
I'm young

944
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,719
and you're not old,

945
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm single-minded,

946
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,239
so are you.

947
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,039
Why don't they know

948
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:22,719
how to cherish them?

949
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,159
You're right.

950
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,679
I can't even compare to you.

951
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Who else would cherish me?

952
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,199
I don't have the strength to fight with you today.

953
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
Bite your tongue and kill yourself.

954
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,639
I'm here to comfort you

955
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,800
because you're in a bad mood.

956
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,679
What do you mean?

957
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,639
No need.

958
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,239
Also,

959
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,480
don't make it

960
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,000
sound like we're in the same boat.

961
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,920
I'm much better than you.

962
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,360
At least we're together.

963
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,760
We're together.

964
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,119
What are you worrying about?

965
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,079
Are you crazy?

966
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,559
Although I haven't got over

967
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,760
the pain of falling out of love yet,

968
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,039
But I'm going to

969
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,559
help you analyze it,

970
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,559
Look,

971
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,960
what's your relationship

972
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,800
with Mr. Yuan now?

973
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,599
Cold and hot,

974
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,880
what does that mean?

975
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,199
The foundation of your relationship

976
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,800
is very weak.

977
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
This relationship

978
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,440
is like building a building,

979
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,159
We have to lay the foundation first.

980
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,239
What if the foundation is stabilized?

981
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,119
Then our relationship will be solid, right?

982
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,159
To make a long story short.

983
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,599
Shouldn't I

984
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
help you analyze it

985
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,639
bit by bit?

986
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,480
Tell me.

987
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,000
I was kind enough to give you advice,

988
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,760
You're so unappreciative,

989
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,639
yet you think I'm stupid.

990
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,079
I don't understand.

991
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,480
Why are you so stupid?

992
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,079
If I had the relationship

993
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,599
between you and Mr. Yuan,

994
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,079
My child

995
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,360
already knows how to make soy sauce.

996
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,000
Look,

997
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,639
you and Mr. Yuan

998
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,599
have known each other for so many years,

999
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,679
Don't you have any memories

1000
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,559
worth remembering?

1001
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,519
When you have a chance,

1002
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,199
you can recall the past with her,

1003
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,960
Think about the future.

1004
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,079
You don't have a chance.

1005
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,280
You just create opportunities.

1006
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,519
Get the moon before you get the water.

1007
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,559
Do you understand?

1008
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,480
That's your sister-in-law

1009
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,760
and me's couple table.

1010
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,239
Memories,
