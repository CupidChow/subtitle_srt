1
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Ge Ge,

2
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,680
Ge Ge is back.

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,719
You came back

4
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,879
early today.

5
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,079
Come on.

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,840
Be careful.

7
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,560
Are you tired?

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Give me the bag.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,599
Hurry up!

10
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Sit here and rest for a while.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Do you smell any fragrance?

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,239
Guess

13
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,040
what soup I made for you today?

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,359
I can't guess.

15
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,719
Why can't you figure it out?

16
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,879
Carassius crucian bean curd soup,

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,759
I ran out in the morning.

18
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,159
I bought you fish and tofu,

19
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,319
so that you

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,360
can have more soy products.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Tell me,

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
for the sake of your health,

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
You took great pains.

24
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,159
Come on, try my cooking.

25
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,840
It's a little hot.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,159
-Be careful. -Take it.

27
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,800
Hurry up. Stop looking at your phone.

28
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,199
Be careful. It's hot.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Thank you.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
It's okay. Try it.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Drink it.

32
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,080
What do you think?

33
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,960
It's delicious.

34
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,000
You're in a good mood today.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,479
What happened?

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,439
I have to ask you.

37
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,639
Ask me,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
I got an interview notice

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
from Shumei today.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,879
Congratulations.

41
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,560
Stop pretending.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,759
I didn't submit my resume at all.

43
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,560
I know it's you.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,639
This soup tastes good.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,439
I can only cook

46
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,439
and feed you delicious food,

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,439
Otherwise, I don't know

48
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,439
how to thank you.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,360
You've been helping me

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
all this time.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,759
I even boasted that

52
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,919
I had to rely on myself.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,479
What's the result?

54
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,000
Actually, I just submitted

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
your resume for you,

56
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,759
How was the final interview?

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,759
Look at yourself.

58
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't worry,

59
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,120
I won't waste

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,000
this chance,

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
Drink more.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
It's really good.

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,639
Right?

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,080
When I see Ge Ge,

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
I have something on my mind.

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,280
Tell me,

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,000
who made my Ge Ge unhappy.

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,680
Actually, I made

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
the military order myself,

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Tell me,

71
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,759
If we can't get the photonics department

72
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,639
done in a month,

73
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,879
So I quit my job automatically.

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,639
Then why did you

75
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,000
issue this military order?

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,719
Your boss won't stop you.

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
And what is

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,439
this Light Division?

79
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,360
It's hard.

80
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,079
It's an advertising company.

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,959
Can Li Meng be listed successfully?

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
It depends on whether

83
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,240
Guangke is willing to cooperate with us.

84
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,240
Do you want my advice?

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,639
Opinion?

86
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,639
Don't look at me like that.

87
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't understand this major.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,839
But in terms of worldly wisdom,

89
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,480
I can still do it.

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
When are you going for the interview?

91
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,680
Tomorrow?

92
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,120
Don't change the subject.

93
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,000
Ge Ge,

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,600
let me tell you this,

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Here's what I did.

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,279
If Mr. Yuan

97
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,480
can't handle Guangke,

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
After a month,

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
are you really going to resign?

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,399
Mr. Yuan is really impulsive this time.

101
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,600
Manager Zheng is really smart.

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,759
I actually became

103
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,639
a pig teammate once,

104
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
And I heard that Guangke is not easy to deal with,

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,639
I'm really worried about Mr. Yuan,

106
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,800
Isn't it all Jeong Yeon Hee's fault?

107
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,720
Is that so?

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,079
Mr. Fu is here.

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,439
Let's go. Work. Work. Master,

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,519
I know I was wrong.

111
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,600
I also want to help the company

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
save costs,

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,800
If I ask you to make meritorious deeds in front of Mr. Fu,

114
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
I think you want to make meritorious deeds,

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
You must be crazy.

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,959
Do you think you can hide your tricks

117
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,120
from Blue Eagle?

118
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,040
I know I was wrong.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,759
All right,

120
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,600
go back to work if you have nothing else to do.

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Master,

122
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,839
can you take back

123
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,000
what you said at the meeting,

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,839
I really don't want you to take such a big risk

125
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,199
because of me,

126
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,879
I have something to do.

127
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,759
Go back to work.

128
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,839
I went out to meet a client.

129
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,000
Go for the interview.

130
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,879
Go for it too.

131
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,560
Goodbye.

132
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,639
Mr. Du.

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,759
Mr. Du.

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
What about the interview later?

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,399
Don't be nervous,

136
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,759
show your usual confidence,

137
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,439
That's enough.

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
How did you know I was going to have an interview?

139
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
Because I'm also an interviewer.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,680
Miss Gu,

141
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,319
in the past few years after you graduated from college,

142
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,279
In addition to meeting

143
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,680
the spa at sea,

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Other than being a salesperson,

145
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,879
do you have any other work experience?

146
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,399
My ex-husband is the heir

147
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,959
to a family business,

148
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,879
I usually take care of

149
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,360
some internal affairs for him,

150
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,800
For example,

151
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,439
as big as business entertainment,

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
I've done everything

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,639
from purchasing to the company.

154
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,759
Then you.

155
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,600
Then why did you go to

156
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
the Sea Club Spa to sell?

157
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,360
I … I'm here to inspect the market in

158
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
Shanghai,

159
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,199
You put a lot of effort into it.

160
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,399
Miss Gu,

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
do you think that

162
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,240
compared to other candidates,

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,639
What's your advantage?

164
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,519
Indeed,

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,399
in terms of work experience,

166
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,480
I'm not as good as many people,

167
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,519
but I'm not afraid to start from scratch.

168
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,800
After experiencing a lot of things,

169
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,879
I know how to cherish and be grateful.

170
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,000
This is very important.

171
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,519
Miss Gu, have you ever used

172
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,759
Shumei's products?

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Sure,

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
then you talk about

175
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,639
your feelings and experiences,

176
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
My feelings about Shu Mei products

177
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,759
are just four words,

178
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,200
Good quality and low price.

179
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,480
Look at you today,

180
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,200
although you look very low-key,

181
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,799
But it doesn't lose its quality.

182
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,279
Miss Gu, right?

183
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,879
Then I want to ask you a question,

184
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,679
that is, you should have used

185
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,720
big-name skin care products before,

186
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,360
So, what do you think,

187
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,799
our Shumei products,

188
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,320
When you compare it

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
with these big-name products,

190
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,919
Where will we lose?

191
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Because the price / performance ratio is

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,960
too high, everyone is pursuing high price / performance ratio,

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,759
Why do we lose

194
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,039
because of the high cost performance?

195
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,279
Cosmetics

196
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,840
are different from other products,

197
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,840
Since ancient times,

198
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
this elixir for prolonging life,

199
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
Only the nobles of the imperial palace

200
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,039
can afford it,

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,559
Ordinary people

202
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,519
can't eat it at all.

203
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
So for this good stuff,

204
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,279
you have to match it with a good price.

205
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,639
Where is Shu Mei?

206
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,639
It focuses on beauty and skin care,

207
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,840
so I think we can

208
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,639
change the packaging.

209
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,320
Raise the price.

210
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,000
Maybe the higher the price,

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,919
the more people will be robbed.

212
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,480
Especially women,

213
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,320
when it comes to beauty and skin care,

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,960
But I paid a lot of IQ taxes.

215
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
That makes sense.

216
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,519
Very thoughtful.

217
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,879
Gu Qiao,

218
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,480
you do it,

219
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,240
Mr. Zheng,

220
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Mr. Zheng I'm here for an interview,

221
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,399
Interview?

222
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,240
Keep it a secret for me.

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay,

224
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,120
I'll get going then. You're busy.

225
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,679
Okay,

226
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,840
Goodbye. Goodbye.

227
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,440
You have a lot of temperament.

228
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,879
I love her bag so much.

229
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,639
Do you still like

230
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,799
your annual salary?

231
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,279
Since Mr. Yuan took the initiative to find me,

232
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,440
I might as well be frank with you,

233
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,759
The rules of Guangke are complicated,

234
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,440
and one of them,

235
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,840
We won't lower the service threshold

236
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,320
because of profit.

237
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,799
Low-end brands

238
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,360
are out of our consideration.

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Mr. Yuan,

240
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,000
don't waste your time.

241
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,960
I heard that

242
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
when Guangke was in the advertising industry,

243
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,639
It's unknown.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,919
Because I accepted

245
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,559
the exclusive terms

246
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,879
of Louis Group,

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,279
That's why he became famous.

248
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,679
All these years,

249
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,120
Guangke has been the boss

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,559
in the industry.

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
But they had to be bound by

252
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,759
the terms

253
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,120
of Louis Group,

254
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,000
Of course,

255
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
to this day,

256
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
Guangke doesn't need

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,159
Louis Group anymore,

258
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,159
Take it as a signature.

259
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,919
But Mr. Xiong,

260
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,360
don't you want to

261
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
reverse this passive situation?

262
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,200
It seems that Mr. Yuan has done a lot of homework.

263
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,679
If Guangke can help Shu Mei,

264
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,519
seize the high ground of

265
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,440
the domestic high-end market,

266
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,840
The price Shu Mei offered,

267
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
won't be lower than

268
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,679
that of any big company,

269
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,320
And more importantly,

270
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,879
we don't mind that

271
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,639
Guangke will continue

272
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,039
to serve other competing products.

273
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,919
Even if Guangke thinks about it,

274
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,840
he'll readjust his strategic objectives.

275
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,399
Shumei is not the first choice.

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
I heard some rumors.

277
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,399
The board of directors of Louis Group,

278
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,559
is discussing to withdraw

279
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,360
from the Chinese market on a large scale.

280
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,320
Guangke

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,960
To extend the contract with Louis Group.

282
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,440
It should be at the end of the month.

283
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,200
If the rumor is true,

284
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,639
is it necessary for Louis Group

285
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,840
to extend the contract with Guangke?

286
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,799
In other words,

287
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,679
will the proportion of

288
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,440
Louis Group's advertising

289
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,679
in the Far East

290
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,399
still reach your expectations?

291
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,679
Shumei is not the first choice.

292
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,000
But if Guangke

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,639
can help famous

294
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,840
cheap domestic products,

295
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,159
If you successfully transform into a high-end brand,

296
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,399
if you leave Louis Group,

297
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,600
Why should I worry that I can't gain fame and fortune?

298
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Yuan has a point,

299
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
but I can't deny it.

300
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,840
How about this?

301
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,679
There are rules in the optical department,

302
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,399
If Mr. Yuan can get Shu Mei

303
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,320
to enter Class A mall successfully.

304
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,559
I can find a way

305
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,240
to convince my boss.

306
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,080
But I have to sign a contract with Guangke

307
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,399
within one month,

308
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,240
Can you guarantee that

309
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,840
if Shumei takes care of Class A stores,

310
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,919
Will Mr. Xiong agree

311
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,080
to cooperate with Shu Mei?

312
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,399
Mr. Yuan is really

313
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,759
the same as the rumor.

314
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,480
Quite bold.

315
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll give you an accurate answer

316
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,639
tomorrow at the latest.

317
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
Thank you.

318
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,320
I look forward to our cooperation soon.

319
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,799
I look forward to working with you.

320
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll get going.

321
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,279
Goodbye.

322
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,080
Hey,

323
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,080
What do you think?

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,279
Is the interview over?

325
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,639
Of course not.

326
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,600
I have you as the vice president to protect me.

327
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960
Are you serious?

328
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,879
Seriously,

329
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,559
we can work together

330
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,360
from now on.

331
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,759
How's it going over there?

332
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,679
It went well,

333
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,840
and now we're waiting for the other party's reply.

334
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,679
Yes,

335
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,279
Ge Ge is so good,

336
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,279
Sure.

337
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,120
Get back to work.

338
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
I'll go back first.

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,919
I'll cook something delicious for you tonight,

340
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,879
Okay,

341
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,240
See you at home

342
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,879
tonight. Bye.

343
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,440
Goodbye.

344
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,240
It's mellow.

345
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,240
The better the tea, the more careful it is.

346
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
There's no hurry,

347
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,080
Yes.

348
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,720
What about Blue Eagle this time?

349
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,200
I was too anxious.

350
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,279
When you think about it,

351
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,240
there are many

352
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,759
good ways to save it.

353
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,919
You want me to persuade Gezi

354
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,039
to give up on cooperation with Guangke,

355
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,840
Where's Guangke?

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,039
Other Party B companies

357
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,399
that we work with,

358
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,159
It's different.

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,120
They are notoriously strong.

360
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
It's difficult

361
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
to win cooperation

362
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,360
in such a short time,

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
According to what you said,

364
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,240
Guangke should be more suitable

365
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,799
than Blue Eagle.

366
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,679
If we can fight for it,

367
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,159
cooperate with them,

368
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,879
Don't you have a better chance of winning?

369
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,159
Why don't you let Ge Zi try?

370
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,080
Didn't Mr. Yuan already issue

371
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
a military order?

372
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,080
It's not easy to explain to the company

373
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,919
when we come back if we fail to cooperate.

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,159
The point is,

375
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,279
you don't want her to leave.

376
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,039
Am I right?

377
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,200
You and Yuan Ge

378
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,759
are old classmates,

379
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,879
I understand.

380
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,159
But,

381
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,159
personal feelings,

382
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,840
You can't

383
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,720
interfere with the company's affairs.

384
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
Don't you remember?

385
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,879
With a 10-fold increase in the price of the joint gift box,

386
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,159
plus

387
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
the acquisition of the overseas brand Li Meng,

388
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,039
These are all

389
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,519
impossible tasks.

390
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,080
But we all made it.

391
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,360
I have faith in Ge Zi.

392
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,600
Have some tea.

393
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,680
It seems that your Mr. Fu

394
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,279
is not less angry than me.

395
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,759
It's my fault this time.

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
It was my fault.

397
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
That led to the current situation.

398
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,000
Sorry for the trouble.

399
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,319
I'm really sorry.

400
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,359
You really owe me

401
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,680
a big favor this time.

402
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,799
You don't even know,

403
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,400
for the sake of your contract terms,

404
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,039
Every day, I was blushing and having a thick neck

405
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,839
with people

406
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,440
from the Planning Department and Legal Department,

407
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,039
As a result, you turned around

408
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,200
and went to the Department of Light.

409
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,559
Miss Maggie has a lot of money,

410
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,200
so she's willing to come out and have a drink with me.

411
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't call me sister.

412
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,119
I'm getting old.

413
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
What about me?

414
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
I really took a fancy to you.

415
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,640
If we can't work together,

416
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,960
we can at least

417
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,079
have a drink and talk,

418
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,240
Yes, yes, yes.

419
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,000
Come on, let's drink.

420
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,960
But I've always been

421
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,759
curious about something,

422
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,920
Why don't you

423
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
come to Shu Mei

424
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,519
to be a shrimp soldier and crab soldier

425
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,880
with a bright future abroad.

426
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,119
Are you trying to

427
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,440
apologize under the guise of apology,

428
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,119
Give me a delaying tactic.

429
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,359
Okay, let's give your Mr. Yuan

430
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,200
the bottom line.

431
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,920
You know it.

432
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Be careful.

433
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,079
Okay, I'm fine.

434
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,960
Yes.

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,720
Let's take a look around later.

436
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Okay.

437
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,960
Du Bingwen.

438
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,599
Du Bingwen.

439
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,079
Our boss agreed.

440
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,519
As long as Shu Mei can settle in

441
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,599
at least one Class A mall

442
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,039
within one month,

443
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,759
Guangke is willing to cooperate with you.

444
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,799
Thank you, Sherry.

445
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,799
But if you want to enter a Class A mall

446
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,839
within one month,

447
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,480
It's not easy.

448
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Good luck.

449
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,799
Gu Qiao.

450
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,680
Gu Qiao.

451
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,319
Gu Qiao.

452
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,160
Gu Qiao

453
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,160
Ge Ge, I didn't have time to make breakfast,

454
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,079
so I went out to buy it.

455
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,519
Eat first. I haven't washed yet.

456
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,240
Eat it.

457
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,440
Gu Qiao

458
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,720
Let's cancel the breakfast

459
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,359
at home in the future.

460
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,799
We're running out of time. We'll be stuck in traffic

461
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,880
if it's too late.

462
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,119
Ge Ge,

463
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,079
let's pretend

464
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,519
we don't know each other in the company, okay?

465
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,559
Is that necessary?

466
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,920
I don't want people to think that

467
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,519
I came in through the back door,

468
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,519
It's up to you,

469
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,720
Hurry up!

470
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,640
Mr. Du, what a coincidence.

471
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
What's wrong with your mouth?

472
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,000
Someone beat me up.

473
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,519
You hit me during a sleepwalk.

474
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,599
Do you think I'm a kid?

475
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,279
As long as we can get

476
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,039
the entry contract of Class A shopping mall,

477
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,119
Basically, it's not a big problem

478
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,960
to sign a contract with Guangke,

479
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,279
Don't be so stubborn.

480
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,720
20 million is 20 million.

481
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,000
We'll earn it back sooner or later.

482
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,960
Don't push yourself too hard.

483
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,640
I'll take care

484
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,039
of Guangke as scheduled,

485
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,079
It doesn't matter if you can't handle it.

486
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,079
This is

487
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,720
Du Bingwen's problem,

488
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Let him handle it.

489
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,160
By the way, Mr. Fu,

490
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,519
there's something I want to tell you.

491
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,359
I asked my bestie

492
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,640
to work in the company.

493
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,160
This kind of thing,

494
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,279
you don't have to report to me.

495
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,720
It's up to you.

496
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,799
It looks unique.

497
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,119
This is the Marketing Department's office area.

498
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,599
Yanxi,

499
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
this is the newcomer

500
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,119
from Gu Qiao's marketing department.

501
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,839
Take more care of him in the future.

502
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay,

503
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,599
I'll leave it to you.

504
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,400
Don't worry.

505
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,640
Work hard. Come on.

506
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,440
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

507
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,480
Hello, I'm Wang Mei.

508
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:26,880
Hello,

509
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,359
hello, hello.

510
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,119
-This is Xia Meng. -Hello. I'm Gu

511
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,079
Qiao.

512
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,759
Let's say hello later.

513
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,559
Well,

514
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,039
this way. Follow me.

515
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,680
Okay,

516
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,400
She changed her bag again.

517
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,599
So rich.

518
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,920
Do you think the diamonds on her body,

519
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,440
are they real or fake?

520
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,400
Really?

521
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,319
Gu Qiao, are you really here?

522
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,279
What happened to you after that?

523
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,119
Feel free to ask me.

524
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,119
Thank you.

525
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,279
You're welcome.

526
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,079
Hello, Mr. Du.

527
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,359
I've made a deal with Blue Eagle.

528
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,359
As long as you nod,

529
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,440
the contract can continue.

530
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,599
I'll go to Mr. Fu and say

531
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,200
thank you, Mr. Du.

532
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,680
But now that

533
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,240
we have a better choice.

534
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
Is there any need to turn back to the grass?

535
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,240
Yes.

536
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,640
But time is running out.

537
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,440
Class A shopping mall,

538
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,599
it's not easy to settle in,

539
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,960
In case there are any variables.

540
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,519
Soldiers are dangerous,

541
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,480
didn't you teach me that, Mr. Du?

542
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,839
Is your boyfriend back yet?

543
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,880
Why should I report to you

544
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,160
about my private schedule?

545
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,640
My child

546
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,240
is doomed.

547
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,559
Don't you know you need help

548
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,440
when you're cheated on?

549
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,799
Just modify this.

550
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,400
Okay,

551
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,559
Right away.

552
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,519
Manager Zheng,

553
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
well,

554
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Is there anything I can do?

555
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,079
There's no hurry.

556
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,480
Isn't it your first day here?

557
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Get familiar with the working environment,

558
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
and know the rhythm of work.

559
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,680
I'll go out with Master

560
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,279
later.

561
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,039
I'm leaving.

562
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,880
So annoying.

563
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
What's wrong?

564
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,279
I have to sort out the form again.

565
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,960
Let me help you.

566
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,559
You.

567
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,200
Look at my

568
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
Gu Qiao,

569
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,680
Can you do me a favor?

570
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,240
Okay,

571
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,640
Here is a document

572
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,599
that needs to be summarized.

573
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,960
If you have time,

574
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,880
give it to me

575
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,400
if you have time.

576
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Thank you.

577
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,119
You're welcome.

578
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,440
One cup of milk tea,

579
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,079
two cups?

580
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,400
What's wrong?

581
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,920
I don't use this form so often

582
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,880
that I forgot it.

583
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
How do we

584
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
lock this?

585
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
You don't know how to do it.

586
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
I was,

587
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,599
I used to be,

588
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,519
But I forget it when I don't need it.

589
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,000
If you can teach me,

590
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,279
I'll do it for you.

591
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,400
It's okay.

592
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,359
This is quite complicated.

593
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,279
Give it to me.

594
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,839
I'm really sorry.

595
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,720
It's okay.

596
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,799
It's my problem.

597
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,599
She doesn't even know how to use spreadsheets.

598
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,480
That's hilarious. See you

599
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,960
at the exit.

600
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,400
Ge Ge

601
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,440
Why did you ask me to come here?

602
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
It's like having an affair.

603
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,440
It's

604
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,839
an entry gift for you,

605
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,279
Cactus,

606
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
Radiation-proof,

607
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,119
You scared the hell out of me.

608
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:31,799
I thought

609
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,119
you wanted me to grow tenaciously

610
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,319
like a cactus?

611
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,880
That's a good moral.

612
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,119
What do you think?

613
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,279
Can you get used to it on your first day at work?

614
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,799
Of course I can.

615
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,319
Even if you leave me alone

616
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,119
on an isolated island,

617
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,319
I can get used to it very quickly.

618
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,440
Not to mention

619
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,359
this tall office.

620
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,119
Really?

621
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,960
Then I won't be with you at noon.

622
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,799
I'm going out.

623
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,440
You can go with Wang Mei

624
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,319
and Xia Meng,

625
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,119
Just in time to get familiar with

626
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,240
the surrounding environment,

627
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,839
Don't worry about me.

628
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,559
In terms of interpersonal relationship,

629
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
don't you trust me?

630
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,640
Mr. Yuan.

631
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,920
I mean,

632
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,839
he won't gossip

633
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,640
about our relationship.

634
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,759
Don't worry.

635
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
In our company,

636
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,599
he is the least likely to gossip.

637
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,319
I'll get going then.

638
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,519
Get back to work.

639
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,319
Wang Mei Xia Meng,

640
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,119
what would you like for lunch?

641
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,839
It's on me.

642
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,599
Okay.

643
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,359
I won't go.

644
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,319
My mom brought me lunch boxes,

645
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,200
boiled shrimps.

646
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,759
I'm not going either.

647
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Let's go.

648
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,039
Look how greedy you are.

649
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,480
White-boiled shrimp.

650
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's eat.

651
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,799
Please enjoy.

652
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,680
Thank you.

653
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,359
Second Brother Du,

654
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
I said that with the interview,

655
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,480
I should say thank you twice.

656
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,400
Every time, you just say it,

657
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,920
but do something practical.

658
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,359
Got it.

659
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,079
How did you get that wound

660
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,079
on your mouth?

661
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,960
Didn't I tell you?

662
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,319
I was hit by a sleepwalking.

663
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,359
Think of me as a fool.

664
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,119
Let me ask you,

665
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,000
Yuan Ge and that serious man,

666
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,960
What's going on?

667
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,359
What's wrong?

668
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,319
I saw a decent man

669
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,039
with a little girl yesterday.

670
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,039
so

671
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,160
So you went

672
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,559
and beat him up.

673
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,799
You're a man.

674
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,640
Aren't you angry that

675
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
your bestie was cheated on?

676
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,319
Isn't that great?

677
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,599
Isn't this fulfilling

678
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,279
someone's wish?

679
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,039
Right?

680
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,200
Well,

681
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,559
Yuan Ge,

682
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,759
Second Brother Du,

683
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,640
I mean this song,

684
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
Actually, I really like

685
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,119
Zheng Jinnan,

686
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
It's not easy to fall in love,

687
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,759
but you still meet this kind of man.

688
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,480
Yes

689
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,960
She put the little IQ she has,

690
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,160
into her work.

691
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
You have no experience

692
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,519
in social life at all.

693
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,599
I can't tell at all.

694
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,400
What is a good person?

695
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,000
What are the bad guys?

696
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,160
Am I right?

697
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,519
So long-term pain is better than short-term pain,

698
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,799
if you ask me,

699
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,400
You just ran over and said it directly,

700
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,839
taking advantage of it

701
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,920
like this.

702
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, what you said

703
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
is not very serious.

704
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Give it back to me.

705
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,640
Don't tell me.

706
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,519
You've never thought of it that way.

707
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,079
But

708
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,480
Yuan Ge's attitude towards me,

709
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,599
She won't believe me even if I tell her.

710
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
If I tell her that you told me,

711
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,319
do you think she would believe me?

712
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,160
Who said that just now?

713
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,680
You should thank me

714
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,799
with practical actions.

715
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,599
It's me,

716
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,440
isn't it?

717
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,880
It's my treat. You pay the bill.

718
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,720
Come on, have some fish.

719
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,079
Eating fish helps your brain.

720
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,640
Master,

721
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,519
I've seen both upstairs and downstairs,

722
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,480
There is no store transfer here,

723
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,559
and no contract expires.

724
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,039
Isn't there a vacant lot here?

725
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,720
Here.

726
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,079
But next to the washroom,

727
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,880
there's a smell.

728
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,119
And people come and go.

729
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,279
They all go to the toilet.

730
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,119
Will anyone buy anything?

731
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,799
That is to say,

732
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,119
in fact, this open space

733
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,640
was enough to make a shop.

734
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,000
It's just because it's next to the bathroom,

735
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
so I didn't rent it out.

736
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,799
After all, next to the bathroom,

737
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,640
it will still affect the sales volume.

738
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,559
Master,

739
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,039
are you really going to rent this place?

740
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,680
Why not?

741
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,519
Xiong Qiming only said,

742
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,279
as long as we settle in Class A shopping mall,

743
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
So I agreed to cooperate with Shu Mei.

744
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,960
It doesn't specify the location.

745
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,079
I'm 25 years old,

746
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,920
so I have to marry myself off,

747
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,079
If you really want to get married,

748
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,639
you shouldn't choose the one

749
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,440
who went on a blind date last time.

750
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,199
Handsome and rich,

751
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,840
and you blackmailed him.

752
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,039
He loves to watch plays,

753
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,079
I love to watch movies,

754
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,960
We can't go together.

755
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,639
You mean the new guy?

756
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,119
Does it have anything

757
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,679
to do with Yanxi?

758
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
She came in through the back door,

759
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,039
I think Yanxi

760
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,480
took good care of her today.

761
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
But she doesn't even know

762
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,679
how to use

763
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,119
a spreadsheet.

764
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,039
I really don't know why the company hired this kind of person.

765
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,320
How would I know?

766
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,440
Also,

767
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,599
Mr. Yuan is really nice to Yanxi,

768
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,519
Yanxi made such a big mistake this time,

769
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,000
yet she's still willing to take her out.

770
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,639
You're right.

771
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,119
Mr. Yuan has always been

772
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,199
a man of business.

773
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,079
I don't know what happened this time.

774
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,559
It's impossible to deal with Guangke

775
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,800
in one month.

776
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,440
I made a military order

777
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,360
at the company today,

778
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,639
If we can't get the photonics department

779
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,639
done in a month,

780
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,079
So I quit my job automatically.

781
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
But I think,

782
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,920
even if Mr. Yuan doesn't take care of Guangke,

783
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,000
Mr. Fu won't let her go either.

784
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,559
Maybe.

785
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,199
Mr. Fu

786
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,880
has always been unfathomable.

787
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,480
If Ge Ge leaves,

788
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,440
will it taste good?

789
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,480
Delicious What's the point

790
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,159
of me staying here?

791
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,199
I'll buy it for you next time.

792
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,960
Just tell me

793
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,920
where you bought it.

794
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,599
It's not that I won't tell you.

795
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,000
No way.

796
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,800
As for this thing,

797
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,199
I have to figure out a way.

798
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,400
Just like downstairs in our house,

799
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,920
there's a stall stall,

800
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,519
I don't go out often.

801
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,239
Didn't we speak a little loudly

802
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,280
just now?

803
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,239
I can hear it if I hear it.

804
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,559
You're telling the truth anyway.

805
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,119
Go back to work.

806
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,079
The environment at noon

807
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:37,840
is not bad. It's good.

808
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,519
It tastes good, too.

809
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:40,119
-Yes. -Let's go together after

810
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,079
work. Okay.

811
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,719
I'll wait for you. I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow.

812
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,519
Good for you.

813
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,760
What did you have for lunch?

814
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,159
The beef rice I ate,

815
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
the Japanese food I ate,

816
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Goodbye.

817
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,480
Goodbye.

818
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,280
By the way, which department are you from?

819
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,639
Let me tell you,

820
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,880
the boss will come to inspect us at two o'clock today.

821
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,639
Don't be late.

822
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,440
Do you hear me?

823
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,079
Open the door!

824
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,599
There's no one here.

825
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,480
Hello,

826
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,639
Hello,

827
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Who are you looking for?

828
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm from this company.

829
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,000
I just came out to go to the toilet.

830
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,679
I forgot my card.

831
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,719
Open it for me. Thank you.

832
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,440
Which department are you from?

833
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
Me,

834
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,639
Me

835
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,119
From the publicity department,

836
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,639
you can call me Linda.

837
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,840
Propaganda Department,

838
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,039
Propaganda Department,

839
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,920
There are 23 people in total.

840
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,440
Why didn't I know?

841
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,599
There's a girl named Linda.

842
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,039
Do you remember that?

843
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,480
You have a good memory.

844
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,079
To be honest with you,

845
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,559
I'm your

846
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,480
boss's friend,

847
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,679
I'm here today

848
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,000
to give him a surprise.

849
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,840
Boss's friend,

850
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,519
what's our boss's name?

851
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,719
Xiong Qiming,

852
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,920
why don't you believe me?

853
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,400
How about this?

854
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,280
You open the door,

855
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,599
I'll ask him to come out and explain to you.

856
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,480
Why don't you

857
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,880
call him.

858
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,480
You really don't believe me?

859
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,480
Okay,

860
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,000
When I called him,

861
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,719
I told him that you're not sensible.

862
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,599
You also stopped my boss's friend.

863
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,880
I did.

864
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,039
Hey,

865
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,119
Mr. Xiong,

866
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,559
are you in a meeting?

867
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,519
I came here today

868
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,480
because I want to see you.

869
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,639
I have a surprise for you.

870
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
As a result,

871
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
the staff wouldn't let me in,

872
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
That's right.

873
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,159
This is too immature.

874
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,039
Well,

875
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,719
What's his name?

876
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,639
Let me ask.

877
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,360
Your boss asked you what your name was?

878
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,639
What are you doing?

879
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,880
I'm not leaving.

880
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,679
No, I can walk on my own.

881
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,000
Don't fight me.

882
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,039
Let go of me!

883
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,239
I'm angry.

884
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,039
What are you thinking?

885
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:40,960
Nothing.

886
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,480
What are you thinking about?

887
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,440
How was work?

888
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:46,840
Did it go well?

889
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
Good luck.

890
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,239
I was born for the workplace.

891
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,119
I took a fork in the road a few years ago,

892
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,599
if there's anything you don't understand,

893
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,800
You can ask Yeon-hee,

894
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,559
if you're sorry,

895
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,960
You can take it home and ask me.

896
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,159
Don't worry.

897
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,480
Don't worry about me.

898
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,159
You still have a lot of things to do.

899
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,800
I had a good talk

900
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,679
with Xingguang today,

901
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Really?

902
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,559
About your work,

903
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,840
I'm not worried at all.

904
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,559
I'm worried about your life-long affairs.

905
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,920
After what happened to Jinnan Zheng,

906
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,840
I realized,

907
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,519
There are some things

908
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,800
that can't be rushed.

909
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,960
You're just not meant to be.

910
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,400
If it's not the right person,

911
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,679
this fate is something

912
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,400
that suddenly comes back to me,

913
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,559
Watch less idol dramas.

914
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,599
If you have time,

915
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,519
You might as well read

916
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,400
more books and lectures on marketing.

917
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,800
Do you know who hit

918
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,679
Second Brother Du's mouth?

919
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,320
I don't care about him.

920
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,239
Zheng Jinnan,

921
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,039
the second brother Du

922
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,920
he told you about,

923
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,119
It really changed my feelings

924
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,480
towards him more and more.
