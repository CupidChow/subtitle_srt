1
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,479
You're here.

2
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,960
Where's Gu Qiao?

3
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,599
Gu Qiao,

4
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,360
who is it?

5
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,319
Gu Qiao,

6
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
Gu Qiao,

7
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,199
This lady

8
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,240
broke into my room,

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Do I know you?

10
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,000
You don't need to know me.

11
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,639
Gu Qiao.

12
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,280
Since you didn't find him,

13
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,360
you even hit me.

14
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
I think it's necessary

15
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,319
to get to know each other now.

16
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,759
It's fine if you know him.

17
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,759
Sorry.

18
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,040
I want a divorce.

19
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,720
Didn't you tell me

20
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
not to make me regret it?

21
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,279
I was thinking,

22
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,480
I cheated on you once too.

23
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,120
We'll be even with Luan Yu.

24
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
But I can't do it at all.

25
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
From getting off the bus,

26
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,319
walking to the hotel door,

27
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,639
183 steps in total,

28
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,560
each step.

29
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
I told myself,

30
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,000
after today, we'll be even.

31
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,240
I'll forgive him.

32
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,360
Just like every time

33
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,079
he made a mistake,

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,319
He begged me to forgive him.

35
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,399
The ending is still the same as before.

36
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,079
But when I walked to the door.

37
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
I've figured out one thing.

38
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
All these years.

39
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,399
I was lying to myself.

40
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,160
He doesn't love me at all.

41
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,439
Where's Luan Yu?

42
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Luan Yu is very busy.

43
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,079
With such a big family business,

44
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't have time

45
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,319
to be around a woman every day.

46
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,279
It's really like him.

47
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,000
Go ahead,

48
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,879
After all this,

49
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,360
what exactly do you want?

50
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,439
I want a divorce.

51
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,639
Divorce is fine,

52
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,399
But to be clear,

53
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
it's not you who want a divorce,

54
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,079
But my son wants to divorce you.

55
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
What's with

56
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,279
the divorce compensation fee?

57
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,559
Since we're getting a divorce,

58
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,159
we need to settle the accounts.

59
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,679
Luan Yu has been married to you

60
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,519
for less than a month,

61
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,360
But in fact, as soon as you graduated,

62
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,759
he has been supporting you.

63
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
These are the documents,

64
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,879
time, place and amount,

65
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,879
As well as the reasons for consumption,

66
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,600
it's clearly written on it,

67
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,759
It's too trivial. I'm too lazy

68
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,039
to care about it.

69
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,159
If you have any questions,

70
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,279
just ask the lawyer,

71
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,879
Hello,

72
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm He Ming, the gold lawyer

73
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
of Sunshine Law Firm,

74
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,919
I want to remind you, Ms. Gu,

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,559
the law only believes in evidence.

76
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,639
Without evidence,

77
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,279
it's hard to conclude that

78
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,200
our client gave it to you

79
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
on his own initiative.

80
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
Or did you use

81
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,279
his feelings for you

82
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,080
to seduce him.

83
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,159
And threatened to get it,

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
because of the huge amount involved,

85
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,679
We have reason to suspect that

86
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,159
you used emotional seduction,

87
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,600
to commit emotional fraud.

88
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,559
Fraud,

89
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,120
you gave me a gift from him,

90
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
If it's a fraud,

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,279
what's his cheating?

92
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,480
From your point of view,

93
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
I can say it was an impulse.

94
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
It's understandable.

95
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,559
Luan Yu loved it

96
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,960
when she was in college.

97
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
to find superiority

98
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,519
by spending money on others,

99
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
When he bought a gift for Gu Qiao,

100
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,759
he never thought about it.

101
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,200
Whether Gu Qiao really likes it or not,

102
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,799
he's just

103
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,440
immersed in his own feelings.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,639
Guys,

105
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,679
what we're going to discuss today

106
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,879
is the distribution

107
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,279
of your husband and wife's property,

108
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,919
Let's get down to business.

109
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,360
The joint property of your husband and wife

110
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,000
is 200 houses.

111
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,519
The 100 thousand split equally in the divorce,

112
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,320
after deducting

113
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,679
the rest of your expenses,

114
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,559
are the property

115
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,480
under Ms. Luan's name.

116
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,600
Ms. Luan,

117
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,600
I have a reason to give you a full refund.

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,039
I'm here today

119
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,279
to divorce Luan Yu,

120
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,120
I didn't ask his mother

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,399
to come and see me.

122
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,639
I'm sorry,

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,279
I was entrusted by my client,

124
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,799
Mr. Luan Yu,

125
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,039
I'll be in charge of

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,799
your divorce lawsuit,

127
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,759
Now,

128
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,039
on behalf of my client,

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,399
to file a lawsuit against you.

130
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,600
I want you to repay the loan within three days.

131
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,320
Otherwise,

132
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,039
we will resort to the law,

133
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,720
Sorry

134
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,639
for being late.

135
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,840
There was a little situation

136
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
on the way.

137
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,840
Mr. Guo,

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,039
you're just in time.

139
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,480
Thank you for your hard work. Have a seat.

140
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,759
Mr. Guo,

141
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,080
I saw your lecture on law popularization

142
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
on TV before,

143
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
I didn't expect

144
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
to see you in person.

145
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,399
Please have a seat.

146
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,200
Hello,

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Hello.

148
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,639
Mr. Guo,

149
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,600
I'll leave this matter to you.

150
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,600
No problem.

151
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,559
Gu Qiao,

152
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,519
let's go.

153
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,320
Let's get started.

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,799
Okay.

155
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,000
Ge Ge,

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,840
when did you get a lawyer?

157
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,120
Why didn't I know?

158
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,519
I knew it.

159
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,799
His mother is not that easy to deal with.

160
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,679
So I contacted Mr. Guo in advance.

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,879
Thank you.

162
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,759
For what?

163
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,799
I'm here.

164
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,200
Qiao Qiao, Qiao Qiao,

165
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,399
Qiao Qiao,

166
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,679
Where have you been these days?

167
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
I can't find you anywhere.

168
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,840
I was so worried.

169
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,080
Didn't you dare not come to see me?

170
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,919
No,

171
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,519
my mom stole my phone,

172
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,679
She imitated my tone,

173
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,600
sent you a message,

174
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,759
I don't know at all.

175
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,360
Since you're back today,

176
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,159
I really have a lot of things to say to you.

177
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Ever since your mom gave me

178
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,279
the divorce papers,

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,559
I have nothing to say to you.

180
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,279
My mom said,

181
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,159
the bill is just a way to provoke me.

182
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,519
She just wants to put some pressure on you.

183
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,720
So that you can forgive me.

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,159
Honey,

185
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,759
during the days when you were away,

186
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,279
I lost sleep

187
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,720
every night. I was wrong.

188
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,159
I know I was wrong.

189
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
Please give me one more chance,

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,720
okay?

191
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,120
I swear,

192
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,360
from today on,

193
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,559
I won't let you

194
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,399
shed a tear for me.

195
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,600
My mom promised me.

196
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,000
As long as we don't divorce,

197
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,879
the divorce compensation fee,

198
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,840
She won't pursue it.

199
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,799
Let's reschedule the wedding.

200
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,639
This time,

201
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,200
we went to the forest park,

202
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,519
We can go to the island.

203
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
I want to buy you

204
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,159
the most beautiful wedding dress and crystal shoes in the world.

205
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,559
Dream on!

206
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,480
Luan Yu, let me tell you.

207
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,639
With her or without me, I don't have her.

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,279
The divorce compensation

209
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,360
must not be less than a penny.

210
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,679
Mom, didn't we agree on

211
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,440
how much we should pay?

212
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It's not up to you.

213
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,320
We'll follow the legal procedure.

214
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,639
I'll pay you

215
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
a penny less.

216
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,679
Luan Yu,

217
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,639
this marriage,

218
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm going to leave.

219
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,200
-No. -Qiao Qiao. Mom,

220
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,440
we're

221
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,120
both …

222
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,519
Mom, come home with me.

223
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,200
No,

224
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,799
go home.

225
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,240
Mom,

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,639
I almost moved her.

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,759
I almost made it.

228
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,639
Didn't you see who said that?

229
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,039
I'm glad

230
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,039
you came back with me.

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,080
If I were alone,

232
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
I really don't know what to do.

233
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,759
In this situation,

234
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,080
it's impossible to get together well.

235
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,120
Let's wait for the lawyer

236
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
to come up with the result.

237
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,399
Hello, Dad. What's wrong?

238
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,200
Are you done with Gu Qiao?

239
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,519
It should be soon.

240
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,519
Listen to me,

241
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
your aunt Fang?

242
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,080
She said her nephew took a day off today,

243
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,840
and wanted to meet you.

244
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
Dad, I … Your aunt Fang likes you very

245
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,519
much.

246
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,879
I promised him.

247
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,879
Later,

248
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,720
I'll send you the address.

249
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,240
This is on the premise of reconciliation

250
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,600
with the opposing lawyer,

251
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,159
The latest agreement.

252
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Take a look.

253
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,000
I think everything else is easy to say.

254
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,720
It's mainly about money.

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How much did you talk about?

256
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,279
1. 95million,

257
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,799
here's the thing.

258
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,759
In the information provided by the other party,

259
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,639
there is a debit note signed by Miss Gu's parents

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and printed by her hand.

261
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,960
It says,

262
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,360
in September, 2018,

263
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,320
Borrowing 2. 05 million

264
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
from Mr. Luan Yu,

265
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,600
It is used to purchase the house in full,

266
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,600
after deducting the 100 thousand before marriage,

267
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
The remaining 1. 95 million,

268
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,759
since the borrower

269
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,279
is Miss Gu's parents,

270
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,039
Legally speaking,

271
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,000
this money,

272
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,919
It should be paid

273
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,600
by Miss Gu's parents.

274
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,279
So?

275
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,960
But my mom told me at that time,

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,919
we only paid the down payment for this house,

277
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,840
Besides,

278
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,200
did my brother earn this money from doing business?

279
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,360
Plus my parents'savings

280
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,639
over the years.

281
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,919
This IOU is a copy,

282
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,720
and the original is still in their hands.

283
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,159
Ge Ge, I'll go back first.

284
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,840
I'll go back with you.

285
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,279
As for this matter,

286
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,519
I can only solve it myself.

287
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,639
Mr. Guo, thank you. The bride

288
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,879
who ran away from marriage is back.

289
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Why did you come back?

290
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,399
On your own,

291
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,960
you put a good wedding,

292
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,639
It's a mess.

293
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,360
You probably don't know it yet.

294
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,639
Your brother's marriage is thanks to you.

295
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,840
It might turn yellow, too.

296
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,639
All right, stop it.

297
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Next,

298
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,919
about the Luan family,

299
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,039
What are you going to do?

300
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,039
What else can I do?

301
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,039
The whole family

302
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,320
must have gone to Luan's house

303
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,639
to apologize,

304
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,320
I won't make up for it.

305
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,159
I want a divorce,

306
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,799
divorce, divorce,

307
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,920
Who do you think you are?

308
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,839
The 18-year-old yellow flower girl?

309
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,319
Let's talk about it.

310
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,160
Gu Qiao

311
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,200
I've been there before,

312
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,359
and I know

313
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
what's at stake here.

314
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,519
You're so young,

315
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,000
you just got married and you got divorced,

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,839
What did you become?

317
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,240
You're getting married for the second time, you know?

318
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,039
Which man do you think

319
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,839
will still like you?

320
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,599
To marry a second-married girl.

321
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,640
I'm really doing this for your own good.

322
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
Mom, is this what you want for me?

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Look,

324
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,400
isn't it all said on the internet?

325
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,680
A lot of men

326
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
make mistakes like this and that,

327
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,000
It doesn't matter if you make a mistake,

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,319
just correct it.

329
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,640
What if you make a mistake?

330
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,599
Will it be too late?

331
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,559
Aren't you going to live the same life?

332
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,119
If you really want to be good for me,

333
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,759
just put that 1. 95 million

334
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,279
Return it

335
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,960
What 1. 95 million?

336
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,079
You borrowed it from the Luan family?

337
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:55,839
1. 95million,

338
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,440
return it immediately.

339
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,599
I bought a house for your brother.

340
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,200
It's gone.

341
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,079
Then sell the house.

342
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,119
Look,

343
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
she can even say that.

344
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,720
Gu Qiao,

345
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
why don't you

346
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,799
give up your happy life?

347
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,519
If you don't want it, you don't want it.

348
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,559
Forget it. I don't want it.

349
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,839
What about your brother?

350
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Have you considered

351
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,079
your brother's happy life?

352
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,200
Our whole family

353
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,119
has already lost all their face.

354
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,119
Now you're going to sell

355
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,759
the house where your brother got married,

356
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,279
He won't be able to get married.

357
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,200
What should I do?

358
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
My daughter,

359
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,160
Dad

360
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,119
I understand you.

361
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,920
I respect you too,

362
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,240
but you said

363
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,440
you wanted to sell the house.

364
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,079
Me,

365
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,759
I think it's thoughtless.

366
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,960
You know your brother is not capable,

367
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,119
if we hadn't bought this house,

368
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,039
Your brother won't be able to afford a house for the rest of his life.

369
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,640
Now,

370
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,039
you want to sell the house.

371
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,920
That's true.

372
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,200
Push your mom and me

373
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,559
into the fire.

374
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:53,920
Okay,

375
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,119
I don't need to sell

376
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,920
the house. I'll pay it back myself.

377
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,640
But for this marriage,

378
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,559
I have to divorce

379
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,759
that money,

380
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,359
We can help

381
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,359
pay it back.

382
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,839
How long are you going to go

383
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,160
with such a small retirement salary?

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
Gu Qiao,

385
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,160
even if you want a divorce,

386
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,440
Can you wait for your brother

387
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,359
to get married before you divorce him,

388
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,640
We can't lose both of them.

389
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
How could you come up with this idea?

390
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,799
It's definitely not good to leave.

391
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,359
You can't say that.

392
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,559
Daughter,

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,519
calm down.

394
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,799
Think about it carefully,

395
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:33,799
Sis,

396
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,559
Sis, where are you going?

397
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
My parents are old,

398
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,640
why are you still like this?

399
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,519
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,160
You even taught me?

401
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:43,720
Me

402
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,519
Return the watch I gave you.

403
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,480
No, no, no.

404
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,119
Sister, let go.

405
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,799
You're dutiful,

406
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,880
you do it,

407
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,960
Sis,

408
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,799
you're actually quite well-off,

409
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
Why are you here for a blind date?

410
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,400
Maybe he's too busy with work.

411
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,559
That's true.

412
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,400
hear about

413
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
It's stressful to work in a big city,

414
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,640
so after you get married,

415
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,119
Are you planning to go back to your hometown?

416
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,920
I never thought

417
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,920
I was the only child in my family,

418
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm not likely to go to Shanghai

419
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,599
to develop in the future

420
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,480
even if my job is stable.

421
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,279
Shumei is a big company,

422
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,559
you can

423
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,960
apply to be

424
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
a district manager or something,

425
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,240
What about us?

426
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
For three to five months,

427
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,599
if appropriate,

428
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,880
While going through the process,

429
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,759
preparing for pregnancy,

430
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,200
Don't worry.

431
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,839
I've prepared the bride price.

432
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,119
We can do it

433
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,079
according to Shanghai's standards,

434
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,759
His parents are old,

435
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,519
and he wants to have a grandson early.

436
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,960
What if I tell you that

437
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,440
I can't give birth.

438
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,400
Just tell me if you don't want to go.

439
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,799
There's no need to be so scary.

440
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,359
Making up such a ridiculous reason,

441
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
where do you want me

442
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,599
to put my old face?

443
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,920
You have to listen to me.

444
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,920
Didn't you give me

445
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,759
the order?

446
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm doing this for your own good.

447
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,279
Every parent says he's doing it

448
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,920
for the good of his children.

449
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,599
Then why are there so many people?

450
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,240
Not doing well,

451
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,079
Me.

452
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay,

453
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,920
You're so stubborn. You've always

454
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,279
been stubborn to me since childhood,

455
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,599
Because I'm not your subordinate.

456
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,119
I can't afford it either.

457
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,559
A girl like you.

458
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,680
It's her.

459
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,519
You act like your mother is dead all day,

460
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,200
and you won't even fart

461
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
all day long.

462
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,759
Her mother is dead.

463
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,799
You don't know it yet.

464
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,559
It turns out that she's really

465
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,839
a child whose mother died.

466
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,319
Can you say that again?

467
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
You know how to talk.

468
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,119
I thought you were dumb?

469
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,160
The child whose mother died,

470
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,359
I told you. How is it?

471
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,680
How dare you hit me?

472
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,599
Hit her!

473
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,599
Kick me

474
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,440
and you still dare to fight back.

475
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,720
Let go!

476
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,680
What are you doing?

477
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Are you bullying me?

478
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,480
Go away!

479
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,039
What class are you

480
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,200
from Class 4? Are you meddling?

481
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,119
I just meddle.

482
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,920
So what?

483
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,799
Go now.

484
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,240
Wait for me. I'm telling you,

485
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,519
I'll wait for you.

486
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,559
Wait and see!

487
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,599
What are you talking about?

488
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,079
Are you okay?

489
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,119
Get up.

490
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,359
Thank you.

491
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm Gu Qiao from Class 3.

492
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,359
I'm Yuan Ge from Class 1. I know

493
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,160
you always

494
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,240
get the first place in the exam.

495
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,400
Can I go to your house

496
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,799
and do my homework with you?

497
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Yuan Ge.

498
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,440
Have you ever been to another city?

499
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,480
What's the farthest place

500
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,319
you've been to?

501
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,640
Shanghai,

502
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,519
Shanghai,

503
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Is it fun?

504
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,920
It's okay, right?

505
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,039
There are a lot of cars,

506
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,000
so it takes a long time to cross the street.

507
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,000
The houses are tall.

508
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,279
It looks like a monster.

509
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,559
If you live in a high place,

510
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,000
isn't it closer to the sky?

511
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,319
Right?

512
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm going to Shanghai, too.

513
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,880
Yuan Ge,

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,720
let's go to Shanghai together in the future,

515
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,400
Okay?

516
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Don't you like your hometown?

517
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,880
I hate this place.

518
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,079
I hate my parents.

519
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
I hate my brother the most.

520
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,799
I brought you something

521
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,119
delicious. Thank you.

522
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,440
My dad said that

523
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,079
there are a lot of big companies in Shanghai,

524
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,079
If you study in Shanghai,

525
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,359
you can stay in Shanghai after graduation.

526
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,079
We'll study hard

527
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
and get into a key middle school.

528
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,480
You'll be admitted to Shanghai University in the future.

529
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
When the time comes,

530
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,640
we'll go to Shanghai together,

531
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,599
Then you have to help me.

532
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
I'm not as good at studying as you.

533
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,160
Uncle,

534
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,720
I'm here.

535
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,319
Gu Qiao is here,

536
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:36,880
Come on,

537
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,559
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

538
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Have a seat.

539
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,279
I'll get you some chopsticks.

540
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,640
Uncle, did you make all these?

541
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
That's amazing.

542
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,079
Of course I did it.

543
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,559
Let me try it.

544
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,720
I'll serve you a meal.

545
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,279
Okay.

546
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,039
What do you think of my cooking?

547
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,240
Uncle,

548
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,559
I'll give you 90 points.

549
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm afraid you'll be proud.

550
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,640
Gu Qiao is so talkative,

551
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,359
I'm still cooking soup.

552
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,119
Uncle, did you bring back the salt

553
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,839
from the supermarket?

554
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm not full.

555
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,039
Lower your voice.

556
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,200
Don't let uncle hear you.

557
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,240
He went to bed early at this hour.

558
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,440
This uncle is quite pitiful.

559
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Just one person.

560
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,839
I'm sure you can't eat well.

561
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,400
He asked for it.

562
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,640
Back then, my mom

563
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,039
sent it to him three times a day.

564
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,559
Does he still hate this and that?

565
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
Every family has a difficult experience,

566
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,920
and I'm worried about you too.

567
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
How long have you been single?

568
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,160
How can he not worry?

569
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,599
I was too busy at work.

570
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,119
Don't tell me that

571
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,720
no matter how busy you are with this job,

572
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,119
I also have time to date,

573
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,359
you have no idea how busy I am.

574
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,880
I don't want to ask the old man for money,

575
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,519
but I'm floating around Shanghai alone.

576
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,519
Every month's living expenses,

577
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,960
don't they all point to that salary?

578
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,759
How can I get a promotion and a raise if I'm not busy?

579
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,039
How can I have time for a relationship?

580
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,599
You are crazy.

581
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,359
Urban disease,

582
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,599
you said you live in a big city,

583
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,799
What do you call this?

584
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,680
Go against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat.

585
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,599
So I have no choice

586
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,559
but to fight like this.

587
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,039
Maybe.

588
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,920
Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about you.

589
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,319
You're divorced.

590
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,920
What are you going to do next?

591
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,759
What plan can I have?

592
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,319
Find a way to earn money,

593
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,480
and pay off the debt, okay?

594
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,519
I've paid the debt for you.

595
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,079
Where did you get so much money?

596
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,720
Don't worry about that.

597
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,160
I didn't steal it or rob it.

598
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,200
Go wash up.

599
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,640
Gu Qiao.

600
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,319
Would you like to

601
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,160
have a break-up meal with me?

602
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,039
Let's save the farewell meal

603
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,359
for your next one.

604
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,519
From marriage to divorce,

605
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,160
it took me

606
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
less than a month,

607
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,799
It's kind of a record-breaking.

608
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,759
What?

609
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,039
Regret it?

610
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,559
What's there to regret?

611
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,880
We can

612
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,960
live in a nursing home together when we get old.

613
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,279
I'm relieved

614
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,559
that you think so.

615
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,000
Where are we going next?

616
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,839
I'll take you to the beach.

617
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,079
Okay.

618
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,279
We need to take a close-up here.

619
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,920
Okay,

620
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,359
Okay,

621
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Pink.

622
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,640
What are you doing now?

623
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,200
Selling bags.

624
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,000
I told you,

625
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,880
You don't have to pay back my money in a hurry.

626
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,480
If you really don't have anything to do,

627
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,480
you might as well think about it,

628
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
What's your next plan?

629
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
Even if you don't have a goal,

630
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,559
you should at least have a direction.

631
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,839
I have a goal.

632
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,480
My goal,

633
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,400
I just want to pay back 2 million as soon as possible.

634
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:44,720
2million,

635
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,480
it's really not as important as your future.

636
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,680
All right, I got it.

637
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,720
Go to bed early.

638
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

639
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,039
Okay. Go to bed early, too.

640
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,920
Stop messing around.

641
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,559
Take another close-up here.

642
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,519
So, you two

643
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,799
are not just classmates,

644
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,319
Back then, you chased Yuan Ge.

645
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,599
Yes,

646
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
But Mr. Yuan rejected it.

647
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,319
It seems like that's true.

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,880
Mr. Fu,

649
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,559
Gezi,

650
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,960
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

651
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,160
Du Bingwen,

652
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Mr. Yuan Really,

653
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,039
It's exactly the same as

654
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,039
when we were in college.

655
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,960
Now that you two are

656
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,079
old classmates,

657
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,079
I don't need to introduce you.

658
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,119
Bingwen is Shu Mei,

659
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,559
the new brand director,

660
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,759
Since you two

661
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,160
are classmates,

662
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,319
I believe in the future.

663
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,480
You two work together.

664
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,000
It will be very tacit.

665
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
That's for sure.

666
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,640
Yuan and I,

667
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,519
why did we

668
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
raise the price

669
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,839
of Shumei's new products by 10 times? Mr. Yuan,

670
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,480
why is it the low-end market in China?

671
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,760
It's saturated.

672
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Shu Mei wants to transform,

673
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We have to conquer

674
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,679
the high-end market,

675
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,880
So this time, we're looking for a high-end brand,

676
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,960
and we're going to have a joint name.

677
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,079
It's also a joint test

678
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,000
of brand names,

679
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,119
A lot of peers have done it,

680
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,559
and it turns out,

681
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,760
Half the Results for Twice the Effort.

682
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,880
Besides,

683
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,840
what kind of brand joint name

684
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,800
can make customers

685
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
willing to buy Shan Bingwen

686
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,559
ten times as much,

687
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
Why don't you go back to work first.

688
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,480
-Let me talk to

689
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:36,880
Gezi. -Okay.

690
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,239
Ge Zi.

691
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,639
After all,

692
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,639
this is Bingwen's first plan

693
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,280
to take office as the new official in Shumei,

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,519
I'm embarrassed too.

695
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,039
To humiliate him,

696
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,159
I remember Shumei's performance

697
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,519
has slowed down in recent years,

698
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,519
You once said that if you want to change,

699
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,960
it's better to give him a chance

700
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,679
to try.

701
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,480
What do you think?

702
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,960
I agree with your joint name.

703
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,840
But raise the price ten times.

704
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,679
It's not that easy.

705
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,480
also

706
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,440
Who let you in?

707
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,199
Get out.

708
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:16,800
Mr. Yuan,

709
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm new here,

710
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,440
I don't understand

711
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:21,639
many rules. Please,

712
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,400
Thank you for your advice.

713
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,559
Please give me more advice.

714
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,679
Okay,

715
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,079
Start.

716
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,360
Okay, okay.

717
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,480
Okay, okay.

718
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,039
Okay.

719
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,400
No need to give me advice.

720
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,119
Mr. Du,

721
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,039
if there's nothing else,

722
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,960
Go back to your work.

723
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,800
I know.

724
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,800
You're still mad at me

725
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,920
for that,

726
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,840
I wasn't sensible when I was little,

727
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,679
but now I've grown up.

728
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,360
Well, why did I hear that

729
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,559
Mr. Du and Mr. Yuan went to college together,

730
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,719
What a coincidence.

731
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,920
What's so strange about that?

732
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,039
Aren't you and Xia Meng

733
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,119
classmates in high school?

734
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,159
That's different.

735
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,679
I think they have

736
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,000
an unusual relationship.

737
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,599
How is it unusual?

738
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,599
They have feelings for each other,

739
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,440
or they have grudges.

740
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,079
Of course.

741
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,679
What are you gossiping about during working hours?

742
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:17,639
work

743
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,000
You're back.

744
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,920
Hurry up!

745
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,679
Wash your hands and eat now.

746
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,760
It's so rich.

747
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,280
Let me tell you,

748
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,079
if I'm here,

749
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,400
You are not allowed to order takeout.

750
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,880
Where's your home?

751
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,480
You have to look like a home.

752
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,800
In the future,

753
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,519
before I

754
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,639
find a job,

755
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,559
You're outside and I'm inside,

756
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,239
Okay,

757
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,920
I'm in charge of making money to support the family,

758
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,159
while you're in charge of being pretty,

759
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
Our two-person world has begun.

760
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:01,840
Come on,

761
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,400
Try it.

762
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,480
How is my cooking?

763
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,440
How is my cooking?

764
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,360
It just came out of the pot.

765
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:10,840
What do you think?

766
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,119
Delicious.

767
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,119
Hyun-neul is a good cook,

768
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,440
or in the future,

769
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,719
As a husband-to-child teacher,

770
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,599
you also took

771
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,719
a good husband.

772
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,400
How was your work today?

773
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Did it go well?

774
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,639
It's going well.

775
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,440
It's going well.

776
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,480
There is a new brand director

777
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,840
in our company.

778
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,519
Guess who it is?

779
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
How could I have guessed?

780
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,480
I know

781
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,679
Second Brother Du,

782
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Second Brother Du,

783
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,159
he's not coming

784
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:39,920
after you again.

785
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,039
When he was in school,

786
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,480
he was suppressed by you.

787
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,400
Now that I'm on duty,

788
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,480
I still have to be your subordinate,

789
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,159
So pitiful.

790
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,760
What a poor man.

791
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,920
There must be something to hate.

792
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
I'm telling you,

793
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,079
you did that to him.

794
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,199
Prejudice? What prejudice

795
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,880
can I have against him?

796
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,679
It's your position, okay?

797
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,840
I almost forgot.

798
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,920
When you were in school,

799
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,159
you were bribed by him everywhere.

800
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,440
That's because he treats you well.

801
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,480
And Second Brother Du is quite nice,

802
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,840
he has a good family and is smart,

803
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
She's good at studying

804
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,239
and has a good relationship with girls,

805
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,119
Look at him confessing his love to you,

806
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:13,880
You're still

807
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,440
I have no prejudice against him.

808
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,320
If you just don't like it,

809
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,119
what kind do you like?

810
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,679
I like people like you,

811
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,320
Okay,

812
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,440
It's a deal.

813
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,800
Let's get it done tomorrow.

814
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,679
Okay.

815
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,760
Come on. It's settled.
