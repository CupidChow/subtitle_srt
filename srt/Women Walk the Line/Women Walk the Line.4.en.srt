1
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,280
Welcome next time.

2
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,840
Hello,

3
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,479
Hello,

4
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm here to apply for a job.

5
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,319
Wait there for a moment.

6
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,439
I'll call the supervisor for you.

7
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,319
-Okay. -Thank you. Hello.

8
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,479
My name is Gu Qiao.

9
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,879
I'm here to apply for a job in sales.

10
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,520
This is my resume.

11
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,759
As for the profession of sales,

12
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,479
let me smile.

13
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,400
Smile.

14
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay,

15
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
Come to work tomorrow.

16
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
By the way,

17
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,680
we don't have a guaranteed salary here.

18
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
It all depends on performance.

19
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,319
Only when your performance is up to standard

20
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,319
can you become a full member. Is that acceptable?

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
Yes

22
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
Don't be late tomorrow at eight o'clock.

23
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,079
Dr. Xu,

24
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
I've finished taking the medicine.

25
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,279
There are also people who insist on running, doing spa treatments,

26
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,759
and even watching idol dramas.

27
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,439
But it's still not getting better.

28
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,079
Drugs can only be an aid,

29
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,319
the key is to look at

30
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,319
your own mentality,

31
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,839
-This needs to be adjusted slowly. -Okay. I got it. Dr. Xu,

32
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,759
what

33
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
are you doing?

34
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,279
Mr. Du,

35
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,319
what is it?

36
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,839
Our new product is very impressive

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,079
this time. Let me report to you,

38
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,279
Less than five hours after it went online,

39
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,759
it sold 3thousand sets,

40
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,879
Our total sales are expected to be

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,720
five times higher than in previous years,

42
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,279
This data,

43
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,279
I read it this morning,

44
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,560
You did a good job.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Mr. Yuan is also to blame for this.

46
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,439
Because of Mr. Yuan's support,

47
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,199
we were able to make it.

48
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,160
Like this,

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,639
Mr. Du,

50
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,839
Do you have anything else to do?

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,279
Where's Mr. Fu?

52
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,720
He praised our department,

53
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,519
and our brand department

54
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,800
is having a dinner party tonight.

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
That is, the celebration party,

56
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,920
and I want to invite Mr. Yuan to join us,

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,199
That's what we all think.

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
I have something to do

59
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,399
tonight. I'm not going.

60
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,319
Fine.

61
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,079
Wait, Mr. Du.

62
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,000
Before you come in next time,

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,079
please knock on the door first,

64
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,839
Thank you.

65
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

66
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,639
Hello, Miss Yuan.

67
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,879
Hello,

68
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Glad to be of service.

69
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,439
I'm Rose Net's golden matchmaker,

70
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
From now on, you can

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,439
call me Miss Yang.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,879
Hello, Miss Yang.

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Where's the gold medallist?

74
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
It's our

75
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
top service.

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,920
We need to handle

77
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,279
the VIP of our Rose Network,

78
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,879
Yes.

79
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,600
I wonder if our service staff

80
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
has made it clear to you?

81
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,319
I just paid the money.

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
Where's the gold medallist?

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,439
The success rate of matching is 100%.

84
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,879
I'm sure I can find you

85
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,800
a satisfactory partner.

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,800
Do you have

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,959
any requirements?

88
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,120
What about the meeting time?

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,839
Try to arrange it

90
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,879
after 8 pm,

91
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,240
And then Monday and Friday,

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
don't arrange it,

93
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,759
If possible,

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,959
I'd like to try to match someone

95
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,040
who's closer to me,

96
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,000
So we don't

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
have to waste time.

98
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,000
It seems that you have a lot of things to do.

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,120
We can discuss the timing.

100
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,920
I mean, do you have

101
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
any requirements for men?

102
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
As long as a man

103
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,240
is alive.

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,399
Miss Yuan,

105
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,639
you're so humorous.

106
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,199
I heard that for dinner today,

107
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
we're going to Matsumoto House for Japanese food.

108
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,120
Mr. Du is quite willing to spend money.

109
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,160
Are you two going?

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,879
Won't Mr. Yuan be there too?

111
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,240
I just ran into my master.

112
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,199
She has something to do tonight.

113
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
What does my master

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,079
usually do to us?

115
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,399
I think you all know it.

116
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,519
Look at the double sales volume,

117
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:17,920
Du Bingwen,

118
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
The way that little man gets what he wants,

119
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,600
I don't like other people anyway

120
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,120
I don't care

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,680
about you two,

122
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,639
Don't go.

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
Yanxi,

124
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,079
we all listen to you.

125
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,519
That's right.

126
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,160
We all listen to you.

127
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,799
But I really want to eat Japanese food.

128
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,840
Me, too,

129
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,279
to Mr. Fu,

130
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,080
A toast to Mr. Fu,

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,000
to Mr. Fu,

132
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,480
To

133
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,399
Mr. Fu.

134
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,399
It's not safe for you to go back so late.

135
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,440
I'll take a taxi back.

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,679
I'll reimburse you tomorrow, okay?

137
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Whatever Mr. Du says is what he says.

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,200
Mr. Du is so sweet.

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,240
Let's propose another toast to Mr. Du.

140
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,720
To Mr. Du.

141
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes, to Mr. Du.

142
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,559
To Mr. Du.

143
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,679
Gu Qiao.

144
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,919
You startled me.

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
Drink with me.

146
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,919
Are you not mad at me anymore?

147
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
Am I that stingy?

148
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,759
Of course not.

149
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,240
That's right.

150
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,039
My lord doesn't care about petty people.

151
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,600
Besides,

152
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
You're my creditor.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,840
How dare you be angry

154
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,279
with my creditors,

155
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,000
What happened?

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm so happy

157
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
today,

158
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
I was admitted

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,720
to the spa.

160
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,720
Really?

161
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,679
How did you pass?

162
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,799
I'm telling you,

163
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,039
I,

164
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,080
Just stand there like this,

165
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,360
the momentum,

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,360
They were stunned in an instant.

167
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,960
They didn't say anything back then.

168
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,960
And then,

169
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,960
next,

170
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,960
Tell me right away,

171
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,399
come to work tomorrow.

172
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,840
Gu Qiao is great.

173
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,039
It's gold.

174
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,360
It shines everywhere.

175
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,600
Come on

176
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,919
To celebrate the first step

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,039
of my successful interview.

178
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,200
Wait.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
Did they say,

180
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,840
when will you become a full member?

181
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,879
What are the criteria for becoming a full member?

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's your performance share

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,399
before becoming a full member?

184
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,600
At this time of celebration,

185
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,639
don't care about these small details.

186
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
Then I wish you,

187
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,840
as soon as possible, become a sales champion.

188
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,720
You seem to be in a good mood today.

189
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,240
Really?

190
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,480
I spent 50thousand yuan,

191
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
ready to find a boyfriend.

192
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
50thousand yuan,

193
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,840
the membership fee of Rose Network,

194
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,840
For blind date,

195
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,159
you spend fifty thousand yuan on blind date,

196
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
I mean, in this era,

197
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,519
you can download any app,

198
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,039
Anything will do.

199
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,960
Or else,

200
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,279
watch the video and send a barrage,

201
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,320
You can even find a boyfriend.

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,679
Why did you spend so much money?

203
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
Time is the most expensive cost.

204
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,399
If you ask the matchmaker to screen it first,

205
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,080
you'll save the cost in disguise.

206
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,919
If you want to find a boyfriend,

207
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,440
you have to ask him to reimburse you

208
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,519
for 50 yuan. You're really willing to give up.

209
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,480
What can I do if I can't bear to leave?

210
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
It's the iron tree

211
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,159
you're talking about,

212
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,559
It's time to blossom.

213
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,440
Your 50 thousand yuan,

214
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,279
I'm telling you,

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,559
You can even build a golden tree.

216
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
People nowadays

217
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,039
are really good at making money.

218
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,440
You can make money even if you introduce someone,

219
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,000
or I'll do the same.

220
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,720
You woke up so early today.

221
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,879
Don't be late for your first day

222
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,639
at work. Your jacket

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,960
looks familiar.

224
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,360
Yours

225
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,159
Why do you wear my clothes to work?

226
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,759
Because it's so ordinary,

227
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,279
in this workplace,

228
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,679
It's just a society,

229
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,679
even though I didn't go to class,

230
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,039
But I've been in society before.

231
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,039
Do you know

232
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,600
the synonym of gregarious?

233
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,679
What is it?

234
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,559
Ordinary?

235
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,480
The more common you are, the more gregarious you are.

236
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Of course,

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
my innate condition

238
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,519
is already here.

239
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,480
so

240
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,159
We can only rely on the outside.

241
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,600
Stand still.

242
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Turn left and right,

243
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,000
dress right.

244
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,120
Standing,

245
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,879
our slogan is,

246
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,799
Fight till the end,

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,159
fight till the end,

248
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,159
Try harder.

249
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,639
Try harder.

250
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,440
Everyone creates good results.

251
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,480
Twist into a rope

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,480
to realize a dream together,

253
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,799
Unity, unity, unity.

254
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,679
Everyone is in harmony.

255
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,360
Retreat,

256
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,320
Get back to work.

257
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,399
Let's go.

258
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,279
I didn't expect you to come.

259
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Your best friend is so powerful,

260
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
why don't you let her

261
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,159
get you into her company directly.

262
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,399
I like to earn my own living,

263
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,360
instead of relying on my best friend,

264
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,799
Ambitious.

265
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,080
It's the same as

266
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,559
when I first came to Shanghai.

267
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,720
This one

268
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,039
It's the project introduction

269
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,679
and activities of our store,

270
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,320
Recite it.

271
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,879
At that time,

272
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,240
we can sell it to our clients,

273
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
Especially the top-up amount,

274
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,200
don't say it wrong.

275
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,360
There was a sale last time,

276
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
charging 10 houses and returning 2, 000 yuan,

277
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,639
It's said to charge 10thousand return 3thousand,

278
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,120
when the customer recharges,

279
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,080
I found that the amount was wrong,

280
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,840
so I quit.

281
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
That salesman paid for it out of his own pocket,

282
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
and took all the money.

283
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,519
Okay,

284
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,639
I'll try to write it down.

285
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,840
Have you ever worked in sales before?

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,679
No.

287
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,320
Then you should study hard.

288
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,600
Don't look down on sales.

289
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,159
A celebrity once said,

290
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,159
"Selling is the easiest job. ",

291
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,519
It's also the most difficult job.

292
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,159
It especially tests a person's

293
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,559
emotional intelligence and intelligence quotient,

294
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,559
There are many doors inside,

295
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,200
for example,

296
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,440
You have to learn how to judge first,

297
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
some people's expressions

298
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
are very resistant at first glance.

299
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,960
Then don't be annoying.

300
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Some people's expressions

301
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,679
can be seen as interested,

302
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,960
Then you have to keep selling,

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,039
and you have to be clear about the audience,

304
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Some people can tell that

305
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,679
she likes spa treatments.

306
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,519
Some people can tell at a glance

307
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,399
that they don't apply for a card when they come to dinner,

308
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,759
Where are we

309
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,399
going to find these clients?

310
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,279
You're right about that.

311
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:39,919
This one

312
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,440
It's the customer's phone number and information.

313
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
You can beat them one by one.

314
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,600
So many.

315
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,039
How long are we going to fight?

316
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,240
Let's finish it.

317
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,639
I'll get back to work.

318
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,360
Take your time.

319
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,279
Tell me,

320
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,039
what's going on?

321
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,879
It's not what we want to go to.

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We just ran into each other at the door,

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,679
I really didn't

324
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,000
go for Du Bingwen.

325
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,200
I just want to eat Japanese food.

326
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,879
What about you?

327
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,679
I just want to find out

328
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,279
who defected.

329
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,960
The result of the investigation is.

330
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
Zhang went too far.

331
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,519
Drink, drink,

332
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,679
sing for everyone,

333
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,240
I've been with him since I finished singing,

334
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,080
Just

335
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
In my opinion,

336
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,879
you two rebelled

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,720
Hello, Mr. Wang,

338
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,200
We are the Sea Club Spa.

339
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,319
Hello Ms. Li,

340
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,440
this is Sea Club Spa,

341
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
Are you crazy?

342
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
I don't apply for a card, I don't bring a card, and I don't charge accounts.

343
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,759
He kept calling me from morning till night.

344
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,759
Do you lack virtue in doing such a thing?

345
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,000
I answer more than a dozen calls a day,

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,359
all of which are from you guys.

347
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,359
Call me again and I'll kill you.

348
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,279
Thank you for coming.

349
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
There's a discount for recharging now.

350
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,079
Have you ever heard of

351
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,319
the rule of one ten thousandth?

352
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,400
No.

353
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,519
That is,

354
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,319
you sell projects to 10thousand personally,

355
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,279
There must be someone

356
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,400
who can be your client,

357
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Ten thousand,

358
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,680
as I said,

359
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,279
Doing sales isn't that simple.

360
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,440
By the way,

361
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
would you like to have lunch with me?

362
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,319
Okay.

363
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,440
I'll decide then.

364
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,920
How about clay pot rice?

365
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,200
There's a clay pot rice nearby.

366
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
It's very delicious.

367
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,079
You must try it.

368
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,000
All right, I can do it.

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,039
30 yuan each.

370
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,799
Let's add each other on WeChat,

371
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,640
Transfer it to me via WeChat,

372
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,079
Okay.

373
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,759
To be honest,

374
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,039
back then,

375
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,720
When Bingwen gave me

376
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
this proposal,

377
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
I have doubts about him.

378
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,400
But then I chose to believe in

379
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
Bingwen's final assessment,

380
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I didn't expect it,

381
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,880
and I was very satisfied

382
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,799
with the answer.

383
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,680
So let's

384
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,480
give Mr. Du

385
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
a round of applause.

386
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,960
What about this joint name?

387
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
It has gained a lot of

388
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
high-end consumers for us,

389
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,759
According to the feedback,

390
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,079
they are here

391
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,559
for the joint name.

392
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,279
But I'm also

393
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,519
very satisfied

394
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,839
with our anti-aging products.

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So we can focus on

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
high-end consumers in the future,

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,079
I have a different opinion.

398
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,319
I saw a lot of comments

399
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
from consumers

400
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240
on the internet,

401
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,000
Many of them

402
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,519
have already questioned

403
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,359
our brand,

404
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,759
Shu Mei was originally positioned

405
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,960
as a cheap skin care product,

406
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
I don't want Shu Mei's reputation to collapse

407
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,319
because of the price increase.

408
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,119
Losing the original consumer group.

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,640
I also read the evaluation.

410
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,799
So,

411
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,279
I don't plan to raise the price

412
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,119
for Shu Mei at all.

413
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,599
But to establish

414
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,200
a high-end sub-brand,

415
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,799
Mr. Du, a high-end sub-brand.

416
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,000
Can you tell us more about it?

417
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,839
What was Shu Mei's earliest position?

418
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,400
It's close to the people,

419
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,519
People

420
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,960
It represents parity,

421
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,319
it represents cheapness,

422
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,400
Cheap?

423
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
It's easy to be replaced.

424
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,960
Be surpassed.

425
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,440
Imitated?

426
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,799
Starting in 2015?

427
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,680
Shumei's sales

428
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,519
gradually slowed down.

429
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,640
In the 2016 Double Eleven,

430
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,319
it was once overtaken by other brands.

431
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,039
In order to cope with this crisis,

432
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,920
the company has carried out reforms.

433
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,440
has launched a cosmetics category

434
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,839
for two years,

435
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,480
In two years,

436
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,720
I just made ends meet,

437
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,880
From the fundamental point of view that

438
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,799
the business aims at profit,

439
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
I think this reform

440
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,559
is a failure.

441
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,480
If only

442
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,680
in terms of profitability,

443
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,079
Shu Mei Makeup is not a success indeed,

444
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,880
but it takes a certain amount of time

445
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,799
and cost

446
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,920
to cultivate consumers.

447
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,400
So, Mr. Yuan,

448
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,440
have you ever thought about it,

449
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
The annual sales of cosmetics

450
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,200
in China,

451
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
Has it doubled from more than 100 billion

452
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,200
three years ago

453
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
to more than 200 billion now?

454
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,319
With the rapid development

455
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,559
of the market,

456
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,799
How much time do you think you have

457
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,680
to train consumers.

458
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,039
To establish a high-end brand,

459
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,480
we need to re-develop it.

460
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,720
Production promotion,

461
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,559
Mr. Du, how many years do you plan

462
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
to spend doing this?

463
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,920
What if I buy

464
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,319
a high-end sub-brand directly?

465
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,400
For example,

466
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,160
Li Meng.

467
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
Mr. Yuan has been engaged in this industry for so many years,

468
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,880
he must have heard of Li Yuan.

469
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Even if it's a direct acquisition

470
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,279
of a sub-brand,

471
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,759
Shumei has to invest

472
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,880
at least half of her

473
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
manpower, material resources and capital,

474
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,799
When it comes to this high-end brand,

475
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,519
if it fails,

476
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Who will take the responsibility?

477
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,720
Causing losses.

478
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,599
Who will bear the responsibility?

479
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,640
Is that okay?

480
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
This will seriously increase

481
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
the cost of the company.

482
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,000
Mr. Fu,

483
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,640
what do you think?

484
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,359
I want to file a complaint against him.

485
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,119
Why?

486
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,519
I can't believe the takeout was delivered

487
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,359
15 minutes late,

488
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,519
I'm starving.

489
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,519
Forget it.

490
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,440
It's only 15 minutes.

491
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,279
It's hard for them.

492
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,440
It's not easy for them.

493
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,279
It's easy for us. How many calls

494
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,079
did you make just now?

495
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,279
Did you sell a card?

496
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,480
Every industry

497
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,799
has its own rules.

498
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,839
When will it be delivered?

499
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,960
It should be delivered at what time.

500
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,200
Otherwise, what's the use

501
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,039
of setting these rules?

502
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,359
Besides,

503
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,680
if I don't complain about him,

504
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
It's not fair

505
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
to other takeout buddies.

506
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,759
Don't mention

507
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,440
Du Bingwen,

508
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
There are really two brushes.

509
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,640
and took care of

510
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,759
this Swiss brand directly,

511
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,160
I just checked,

512
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,359
the person in charge of this brand,

513
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,440
He has a lot of patents in his hand.

514
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,799
In the skin care industry,

515
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,680
there are patents,

516
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,640
That's the king.

517
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,920
There's nothing to say.

518
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,839
Didn't he just come back from Switzerland,

519
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,480
and he has a few in his hand?

520
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,960
Resources that no one can get?

521
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,599
We were talking about the meeting just now.

522
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,839
Why are you so late?

523
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,559
Hurry up and eat.

524
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
Have you noticed?

525
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,680
During the meeting just now,

526
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,200
Mr. Fu looked at the data,

527
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,759
Your eyes are bright.

528
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,680
I think,

529
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,599
this brand,

530
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
There is a high probability that

531
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
we will do it. If we can really

532
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,279
do such a big brand in China,

533
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,279
Someone has already done it.

534
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,960
All right,

535
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,880
let's not worry about it.

536
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,559
In all these years,

537
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,000
when did the company make a big decision,

538
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Mr. Fu and Mr. Yuan

539
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,359
didn't decide it together.

540
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,839
Mr. Fu has to

541
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,119
listen to Mr. Yuan in the end.

542
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,240
Mr. Fu,

543
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,279
Shu Mei is taking the people-friendly route,

544
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:29,920
That's why we can

545
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,039
make our brand famous so quickly,

546
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,440
If consumers

547
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,680
can really accept luxury goods,

548
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
Then their first choice

549
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,680
is also those

550
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
international brands

551
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,519
that have enjoyed a century of reputation,

552
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,759
In this respect, Shu Mei

553
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,920
is not competitive at all.

554
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,480
Ge Zi,

555
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,039
where do you think Shumei's future

556
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,799
lies?

557
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,279
Now we are

558
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,480
the best in the industry.

559
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Think about it,

560
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,400
if you go any further,

561
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
Where else can we go?

562
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,839
Of course I know.

563
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,880
Your dream

564
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,039
won't stop there.

565
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,799
But reform is not equal to transformation,

566
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
we need to take it step by step.

567
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Ge Zi

568
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I don't read much,

569
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,799
so all this time,

570
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
They all like your intelligence

571
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,759
and confidence.

572
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,480
But I hope

573
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
you can have a higher vision.

574
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,799
Further.

575
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,799
Du Bingwen drank foreign ink,

576
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,400
in a high-end brand company abroad,

577
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,519
I've been through it for many years.

578
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,039
I hope in Shu Mei,

579
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,039
you two can

580
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,039
work well together,

581
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,759
Even if Bingwen

582
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,440
is your subordinate now,

583
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,480
But I believe

584
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,079
you have a lot

585
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,640
to learn from each other.

586
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,079
Be open-minded,

587
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,079
remember,

588
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,279
Du Bingwen

589
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,960
is just Shumei's employee,

590
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,720
But you're my backbone.

591
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,119
I know.

592
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
You have concerns in your heart.

593
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,359
The company has established a sub-brand,

594
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,079
of course,

595
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,759
There are many unknown risks.

596
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
But doing business

597
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,039
is like life,

598
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,599
Only dare to fight.

599
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,039
That's why you have a chance to win.

600
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,279
Du Bingwen is new here,

601
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,799
you have to support him.

602
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,599
I didn't expect to receive your call

603
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,799
after work.

604
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,319
As for developing a sub-brand,

605
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:30,960
I agree.

606
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,599
But you must remember,

607
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,319
don't be too aggressive.

608
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,519
You'd better

609
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,119
wait for you

610
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,920
to come up with a mature plan,

611
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,960
Then I'll announce it to the public.

612
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,079
Otherwise,

613
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,359
it will cause unnecessary trouble.

614
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,519
Okay, got it.

615
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,319
The Swiss specialty for you. Do you

616
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,039
still like it?

617
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,400
You're back.

618
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm exhausted.

619
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm so tired.

620
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,799
What did you do on your first day at work?

621
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,720
You're so tired.

622
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,799
I just did one thing.

623
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,200
How can you be so tired

624
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,440
after making a phone call?

625
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,559
I'm telling you,

626
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,039
it's because I'm tired.

627
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,359
Every time I make a phone call,

628
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,640
I'm terrified,

629
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
I didn't know who I would meet,

630
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,440
so I hung up on him.

631
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,160
It's all good.

632
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
Some of them

633
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,759
scolded me.

634
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,880
Come on!

635
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,319
I believe.

636
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,519
What would you like to eat tonight?

637
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,680
Order takeout.

638
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,920
This is not your style.

639
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
I understand you now.

640
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,720
I've been working for one day every day,

641
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,960
and this work

642
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,400
has exhausted me.

643
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,359
I don't have the strength to cook anymore.

644
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay,

645
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,160
what do you want to eat?

646
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,319
I'll order

647
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,119
something expensive. What do you want?

648
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,720
I want to treat myself well.

649
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,799
Okay,

650
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,039
Okay, okay.

651
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,920
Forget it.

652
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't order anything expensive.

653
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,440
It's too hard to earn money.

654
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,119
Just order whatever you want.

655
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,680
Is this a gift for me?

656
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,960
Du Bingwen gave it to me,

657
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,319
saying it's a Swiss specialty.

658
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,119
It's a Swiss specialty.

659
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,519
It makes sense.

660
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,839
Mr. Du,

661
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,720
how could anyone give a watch to someone?

662
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,400
Don't you want to give her a death?

663
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,839
No.

664
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
There is also a romantic saying,

665
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,200
that is, he gave all his time

666
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
to you.

667
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,319
Tell me

668
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
When he comes back to Shumei,

669
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,480
is he still interested in you?

670
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,039
I don't care what he thinks.

671
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
All the men in the world

672
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,480
are dead anyway.

673
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,680
I won't like him either.

674
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,599
I ordered it. Take a look.

675
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
What else do you want to add?

676
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm telling you,

677
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,319
don't just set up a flag.

678
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't hit me in the face.

679
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,039
Well

680
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,680
Why is it so expensive?

681
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,480
It's not easy

682
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,039
in Shanghai.

683
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,559
This way, please.

684
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,599
I'm so pissed off.

685
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,720
Hold on.

686
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
Calm down.

687
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,359
I'm telling you,

688
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,680
If he doesn't give me an explanation today,

689
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,319
I'll kick his company's ass.

690
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,519
All right, all right.

691
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,079
Calm down.

692
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,880
Forget it, Niu. Calm down.

693
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,599
Calm down.

694
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,799
We're here to negotiate.

695
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,440
If you do this,

696
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,519
you won't be able to solve the problem.

697
00:29:59,519 --> 00:29:59,839
Yes.

698
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,200
He delayed me from making money.

699
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,440
I heard he's new here,

700
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,319
What's Du's name?

701
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,519
He killed a turtle grandson.

702
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,960
All right, all right.

703
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,839
Calm down.

704
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,279
Don't hit anyone.

705
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,079
Don't do it.

706
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,160
Calm down.

707
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,400
Don't make me find him.

708
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,240
Mr. Smith,

709
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,400
please go this way.

710
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
This is weird.

711
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,480
As for the acquisition of Li Jingzhi,

712
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
the contract has been prepared.

713
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,079
Let me show you

714
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:33,839
around the company

715
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,079
and look for you, Mr. Yuan and Mr. Fu.

716
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,920
Hello, sir.

717
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,359
Do you have an appointment?

718
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,240
Appointment?

719
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,559
What appointment?

720
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,480
Sorry,

721
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,640
I don't have an appointment for that,

722
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,119
Mr. Du,

723
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,720
I can't let you in.

724
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,279
Take Mr. Smith

725
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,160
to Mr. Yuan first.

726
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,440
Okay,

727
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,599
I have something to deal with.

728
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:50,960
Okay,

729
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,359
This way, please.

730
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,200
Excuse me,

731
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,880
please wait a moment sir,

732
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Let me ask you something.

733
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,599
Hurry up.

734
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,359
What are you doing?

735
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm the new Du

736
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
or something you mentioned,

737
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
It's just that

738
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,400
they have something to do, right?

739
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,119
Guys,

740
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,039
let's talk in the conference room.

741
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,200
Let's go.

742
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,680
Just talk about it.

743
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Don't get too excited.

744
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,359
I'll deal with him later.

745
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,480
Master,

746
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,160
Mr. Du has something to deal with.

747
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,599
I want you to talk to Mr. Smith

748
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,200
first,

749
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Nice to meet you.

750
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
Nice to meet you, too,

751
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,680
Mr. Smith.

752
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,559
Please follow me.

753
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,839
Mr. Du,

754
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,799
this is the first time we've met,

755
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,759
What about today?

756
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,920
We came here in a hurry,

757
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,400
so we didn't prepare any gifts for you.

758
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,839
You're welcome.

759
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,720
What can I do for you?

760
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,799
The thing is,

761
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,599
we are

762
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,039
the channel managers of different regions,

763
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,839
My surname is Liang,

764
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,559
and this is Manager Niu,

765
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,079
-This is Manager Zhang. -Hello, Manager

766
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,960
Liang.

767
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,759
-Hello, Manager Niu. -Hello, Manager

768
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,880
Zhang.

769
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,480
Mr. Du,

770
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,759
you're welcome. Where's Shumei today?

771
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,119
I heard that

772
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,880
Shu Mei will launch

773
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,079
a high-end sub-brand this year,

774
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,279
Is that true?

775
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,839
That's true.

776
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,519
Look,

777
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,000
I told you there was such a thing.

778
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,160
You insisted that it's impossible.

779
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,680
You saw it?

780
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Are you lying,

781
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,920
Mr. Du?

782
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
Previously,

783
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,559
we launched a co-branded model,

784
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
There was a ten-fold increase,

785
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,559
and then we thought

786
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,319
something was wrong,

787
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,839
It's fine

788
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,519
if you sell it online.

789
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,519
now

790
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,079
What else do you want to introduce?

791
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,279
A high-end sub-brand.

792
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,359
What should we do?

793
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,680
Because of our

794
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,480
customer channel,

795
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,279
I can't afford such an expensive one.

796
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,279
Yes.

797
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,440
But this is the company's decision.

798
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,480
What about the sub-brands?

799
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,319
It won't affect Shumei's other brands

800
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,920
for the time being,

801
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
For now,

802
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
for now,

803
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,599
What's wrong?

804
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,359
You need me now.

805
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,039
You won't need me then.

806
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,240
Take us all to one pot.

807
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,319
Okay, okay, okay, Mr. Niu.

808
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:01,920
Mr. Du,

809
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,000
where's Shu Mei?

810
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,759
We always make cheap products,

811
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,799
so what we pay attention to

812
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,480
is small profits

813
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,759
but quick turnover.

814
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,039
Although

815
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,240
it's selling very well online now,

816
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,200
But our offline sales

817
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,759
are still very popular.

818
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,480
Because of this,

819
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,119
we are able to occupy

820
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,599
the third and fourth tier cities,

821
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,200
Well,

822
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,480
If you change it to high-end,

823
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,960
it will be very difficult for us.

824
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,519
Yes, yes, yes.

825
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,200
The company has also considered it.

826
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,079
So,

827
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,680
what about the launch of high-end brands?

828
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,599
Does not affect

829
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,720
the continued production of cheap products,

830
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,160
But let's go to the ball.

831
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,319
I've seen a lot of your tricks.

832
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,119
As soon as high-end products come out,

833
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:41,839
Okay,

834
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,400
Who would do such a small profit but quick turnover?

835
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,519
How should we talk to this

836
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,759
distributor.

837
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,720
You.

838
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,000
He just doesn't want us to make money.

839
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,799
Mr. Du, I'm sorry.

840
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Where's Manager Niu?

841
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Although he has a bad temper,

842
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
what he said is right.

843
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,680
There's nothing wrong with it.

844
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,279
Think about it. There's no shortage

845
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
of high-end products on the market right now,

846
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,839
Then.

847
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,480
Our distributors,

848
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,319
their high-end products,

849
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,599
It can't be sold at all.

850
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,960
Yes.

851
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
But this

852
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,480
After all, it's the company's decision.

853
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,039
You brat,

854
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,679
why can't you listen to people's words?

855
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,039
I'm telling you, "East" and

856
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,599
"West Niu",

857
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,159
We came

858
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,920
all the way here,

859
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,440
I heard you talking nonsense here.

860
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,679
-I'll keep an eye on it. -All right.

861
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,840
You are quite arrogant.

862
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,840
You can't do it.

863
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,280
Don't pull me.

864
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,239
Mr. Niu, Mr. Niu, Mr. Niu,

865
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,920
Mr. Lao Niu,

866
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,599
I have to teach him a lesson today.

867
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,599
Come here.

868
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,960
Mr. Niu,

869
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,159
come down. Come here.

870
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,519
-Dizziness. -What's wrong with

871
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,280
Niu?

872
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,599
What's wrong?

873
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:47,920
Dizziness? Are you suffering

874
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,880
from high blood pressure,

875
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,440
Niu? You have high blood pressure,

876
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,400
It's not exciting.

877
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,280
Yeah,

878
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,039
don't move.

879
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,039
Dizziness,

880
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,719
Don't get excited.

881
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm sorry.

882
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,159
How about this?

883
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,239
In my opinion, Mr. Du's mind

884
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,639
is not on us.

885
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,039
Where's Mr. Fu and Mr. Yuan?

886
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,880
We want to talk to them.

887
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,199
Since Mr. Fu and Mr. Yuan are not here,

888
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,519
you'd better talk to me.

889
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,639
Who are you?

890
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,119
I can't talk to you.

891
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,360
All right, all right.

892
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,960
That's right.

893
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,519
Calm down.

894
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,800
I don't count.

895
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
How about this?

896
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,079
Go back to the hotel and settle down.

897
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
Take a nap,

898
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,000
wait for the afternoon,

899
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,239
Mr. Fu and Mr. Yuan are back.

900
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll tell them,

901
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,199
and they'll give you a solution

902
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,639
as soon as possible.

903
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,599
What do you think?

904
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,079
I'm not leaving.

905
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,840
I'll wait here.

906
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,400
Okay,

907
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,760
No problem.

908
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,440
I'll stay with you.

909
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,000
What time is it?

910
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,639
Don't sleep.

911
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,920
What time is it?

912
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,840
Mr. Du,

913
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,519
it's been so hard for you to arrange for us

914
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,480
to go to the hotel.

915
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,000
We'll wait for your news at the hotel.

916
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,280
I'll send you there.

917
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,159
Excuse me,

918
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,559
what project do you want to do?

919
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,960
I want to get a massage.

920
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,760
Do you have a regular technician?

921
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,679
Just arrange it for me.

922
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,320
Okay,

923
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,840
This way, please.

924
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:44,840
This way.

925
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,000
What's your name?

926
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,559
My name is Gu Qiao.

927
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,320
What should I call you?

928
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
My surname is

929
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,039
Zhang, Mrs. Zhang,

930
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,280
This way, please.

931
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,559
Hello, Mrs. Zhang.

932
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,440
Our project

933
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,360
is over.

934
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,440
Please rest first.

935
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:00,920
Thank you.

936
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,360
Mrs. Zhang,

937
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,880
this is chrysanthemum tea,

938
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,039
I saw a pimple

939
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:16,960
on your forehead,

940
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,280
I think he got angry.

941
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,639
With the essential oil

942
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,000
you just used,

943
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,159
Internal adjustment and external use,

944
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,119
one step at a time,

945
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,559
Shouldn't you drink coix seed tea?

946
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,599
Get rid of the moisture.

947
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,519
The essential oil you just used

948
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,480
is for detoxification.

949
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,760
Where's the coix seed tea?

950
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,840
It's also for dehumidifying and detoxifying.

951
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,119
This smell detoxes the poison,

952
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,159
but it's easy to get angry.

953
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,320
How about this,

954
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,679
little girl?

955
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,000
You know a lot.

956
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,320
Have a seat.

957
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,280
Okay.

958
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,400
Where are you from?

959
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,519
I'm from Anhui.

960
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,199
I'm good.

961
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,039
Hello,

962
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,639
Supervisor. Supervisor,

963
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,719
Mrs. Zhang is here.

964
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,760
She's in the VIP room?

965
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,239
Your Ladyship,

966
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,679
are you looking at this bag?

967
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,599
That's right.

968
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,360
This is the one.

969
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,559
I like it so much.

970
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,320
Don't worry.

971
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,119
I'll take care of it for you.

972
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,159
Really?

973
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:07,880
Thank you.

974
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,559
Mrs. Zhang,

975
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,039
here you are,

976
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,480
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

977
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,960
I happen to be

978
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,239
shopping around here, right?

979
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,039
I passed by.

980
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm still sitting.

981
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,199
Mrs. Zhang,

982
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
she's a new intern.

983
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,920
I don't know much about rules.

984
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,119
I didn't upset you, did I?

985
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,119
No,

986
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,679
this girl is amazing.

987
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,239
I waited in line for a month.

988
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,480
I didn't buy any bags,

989
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,079
so she helped me with them.

990
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,920
I didn't expect that in your shop,

991
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,239
there's such

992
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,840
a tasteful girl

993
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,679
named Gu Qiao, right?

994
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,519
When I come here next time,

995
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,000
come and chat with me again,

996
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,079
Okay, no problem.

997
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,679
Come out with me.

998
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,719
Mrs. Zhang, take a rest.

999
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,320
Excuse me.

1000
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,159
Take a rest first.

1001
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:58,880
Go back to work.

1002
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
You've been here for a few days.

1003
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,199
Don't you know the rules?

1004
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,679
How can you sit

1005
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,679
and talk to customers?

1006
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
Every morning, I stress that

1007
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
you should stand at attention.

1008
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,159
Lean forward slightly and bend over,

1009
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:19,920
but you are good,

1010
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,880
Just sit there.

1011
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,119
I'm sorry,

1012
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,440
sir. I'll correct it next time.

1013
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
You're new here,

1014
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,000
so I can't be too strict with you.

1015
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,639
Forget it this time.

1016
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,679
It won't happen again.

1017
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,119
By the way, did you get the bill?

1018
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,559
Not yet.

1019
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,159
I'll give you a chance.

1020
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,159
Go get a pile of leaflets at the front desk,

1021
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,119
and hand them out on the street this afternoon.

1022
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,440
Okay.

1023
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,199
Supervisor, this is clearly

1024
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,400
a personal vendetta.

1025
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,559
He saw how well

1026
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,440
you talked with Mrs. Zhang.

1027
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm afraid you'll take away

1028
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,760
his big order.

1029
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,039
I don't think so.

1030
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,800
The job of handing out leaflets,

1031
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,880
the wind and the sun,

1032
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:09,800
No one in the shop

1033
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,719
wants to do it.

1034
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,480
If he didn't want to get back at you,

1035
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,639
why would he let you go out

1036
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,679
and do this kind of tiring work?

1037
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,800
It's good to hand out flyers,

1038
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,599
maybe we can get customers.

1039
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,039
You don't understand.

1040
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,719
The customers who come to the store,

1041
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,199
at least, are here to spend money.

1042
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,119
And you have a strong intention to apply for a card,

1043
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,840
so you're going out to hand out leaflets?

1044
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,639
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

1045
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,159
I'll take it

1046
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,079
as a chance.

1047
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,719
Let me tell you,

1048
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,159
when you handed out the flyers,

1049
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,199
Hiding in the shade of a tree,

1050
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,519
out of the sun,

1051
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,519
You don't have to

1052
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,639
wait at the intersection.

1053
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,280
Also,

1054
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,519
I can't finish handing out leaflets,

1055
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,199
You can throw it in the trash can.

1056
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,440
I just think we hit it off.

1057
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,119
We should help each other.

1058
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,239
Thank you.

1059
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,840
The channel provider came just now.

1060
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Why didn't you tell me?

1061
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,920
We can't let them affect

1062
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,880
Li Meng's acquisition,

1063
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:04,480
So,

1064
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,920
you used yourself as a shield.

1065
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:07,880
Am I handsome?

1066
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,360
Luckily, nothing happened.

1067
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,920
It didn't affect Mr. Smith's

1068
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,280
impression of Shumei.

1069
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,159
Mr. Fu,

1070
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:16,639
Mr. Fu,

1071
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,000
I already know what happened.

1072
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,280
About this matter,

1073
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,199
I want to hear

1074
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,199
your opinions.

1075
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,360
In my opinion,

1076
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,480
the company can't be led

1077
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,519
by the channels,

1078
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,239
Go on.

1079
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,679
Do they have a problem with it?

1080
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,440
We can totally replace them.

1081
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,519
No way.

1082
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,719
These channels

1083
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,800
grew up with Shumei.

1084
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,840
If we replace them,

1085
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,960
it'll be equivalent to

1086
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,079
handing over our channels to others.

1087
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,239
I'll let you go.

1088
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,199
As far as I know,

1089
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,960
60% of the company's

1090
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
annual profit

1091
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,719
comes from the Internet,

1092
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,880
The rent and personnel cost

1093
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,400
of physical stores are very high.

1094
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,800
We might as well take this opportunity

1095
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,639
to replace them.

1096
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,239
Bingwen,

1097
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,280
it's urgent.

1098
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,599
We must handle it very carefully

1099
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,559
and properly.

1100
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,199
You.

1101
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,679
Let's think of other plans.

1102
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,199
Okay,

1103
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,840
I'll think of another way.
