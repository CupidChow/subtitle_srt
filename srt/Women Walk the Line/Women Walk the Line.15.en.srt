1
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,879
Come in.

2
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,239
Gege,

3
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,159
Du

4
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,400
didn't come to work today.

5
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,920
Do you know where he went?

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,719
I don't know.

7
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,840
He didn't report it to you?

8
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
Did you two have a fight?

9
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,640
No.

10
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,480
Do you have plans tonight?

11
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,640
No.

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,240
What's wrong?

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Let's go to the play together.

14
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,960
Why are you suddenly

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,199
interested in plays?

16
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,560
I have a director friend,

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
who directed the play.

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,639
I went there to support him.

19
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,479
Why didn't I know

20
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:19,919
you have a friend

21
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,800
who is a director?

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
It's a secret.

23
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,680
It's a deal anyway.

24
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,919
I'll get going then.

25
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,439
Okay.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,680
You have to be happy.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,319
I'll get going then.

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,879
Goodbye.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,759
Remember to watch the play tonight.

30
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,120
Yes.

31
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,639
Come on.

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,759
Have a seat.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,719
Why is the theater so empty?

34
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
It's just the two of us.

35
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,000
Isn't it good?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,639
Just take it as booking the whole theater.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,719
Come on.

38
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,560
Everyone has a share.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Everyone has a share.

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Stop dancing.

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
Sun, did you pick up the money?

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
Of course not.

43
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,039
I bought it with this month's living expenses.

44
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,280
You're crazy.

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
Give me one.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,039
It's the end of the world.

47
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,319
I haven't spent all the money.

48
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,360
That would be a big loss.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,599
You also believe that?

50
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,840
3: 14 '15

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
this afternoon.

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
How precise it is.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,319
How can I not believe it?

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,319
Have you ever thought,

55
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,400
if it's not the end of the world,

56
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,000
what will you do this month?

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,919
It's not the end of the world?

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
Then every day

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,039
will be the end.

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
I read on the Internet that

61
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,120
if you confess your love

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,959
before the end of the world,

63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
you'll succeed.

64
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
Then you can face the end

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
together with the one you love.

66
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,319
Even if you can succeed,

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,959
you have to have a crush first.

68
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,959
Brother.

69
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,879
Even if you have a crush,

70
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,240
you have to have time, too.

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
In an hour or so,

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,920
we'll all be done.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,199
- Xiaowen.
- Xiaowen.

74
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,319
Where are you going?

75
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,879
He...

76
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
Weird.

77
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,879
Guys,

78
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,720
this is the last meal.

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,879
Let's go.

80
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's go.

81
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,680
Let's go together.

82
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,839
Okay.

83
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,279
Let's go together.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
No wonder it's just the two of us.

85
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,759
A few year have passed

86
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,279
yet you're still watching things like

87
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,000
the end of the world in 2012.

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,639
Even if there's publicity,

89
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,000
no one would watch it.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
What are you doing?

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,879
I'm punishing you for my friend.

92
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,600
How interesting it is.

93
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,360
Let's go.

94
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,319
Let's go.

95
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,519
I'll take the flowers.

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,759
Thank you.

97
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,399
No,

98
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,600
this flower is not for you.

99
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,639
Then who did you give it to?

100
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,199
I'm not giving it to you anyway.

101
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,439
Good for you.

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,399
You even dare to talk to me like that.

103
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,839
What the hell is Du doing?

104
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,319
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong with you?

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,079
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,800
No, no, no.

108
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,399
It's okay. Let's continue watching.

109
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,000
Well,

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
my attitude was a bit bad just now.

111
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,920
But I really have something to ask you.

112
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,040
No way.

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,519
Sis,

114
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,000
just tell me if you have any conditions.

115
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,040
I can help you.

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
Buy me Japanese food.

117
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Sure.

118
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,759
I still have two papers to write.

119
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,959
No problem. I'll take care of them.

120
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,839
Okay. Go ahead.

121
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,079
Her taste is like yous.

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
I remember when you were in school,

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,839
you liked Japanese food too.

124
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,839
Is it OK?

125
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,199
Okay, wait.

126
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,639
No, sister. Hurry up.

127
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,319
We're running out of time.

128
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,480
If you say it again, I won't go.

129
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,639
We are no longer friends.

130
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,519
You are no longer friends?

131
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,240
Why?

132
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,240
Who did you say was looking for me?

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
Where is he?

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,639
He was here just now.

135
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
Yuan Ge.

136
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,040
The one downstairs you mentioned

137
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,279
is him?

138
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,199
Now you know

139
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,680
why we're no longer friends.

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,040
What's wrong?

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,720
Can I help you?

142
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,199
Yuan Ge,

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,439
I just want to ask you.

144
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,079
Do you believe in the end of the world?

145
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,519
The end of the world?

146
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,040
Yes.

147
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,759
No, I don't.

148
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,240
Everything the world

149
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,319
is not that absolute.

150
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,600
It's like 100 million years ago,

151
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
dinosaurs have died out.

152
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
The end of the world for us humans...

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,240
I think there is no absolute thing in the world.

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
Dinosaurs can be exterminated.

155
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,439
Then the end of the human world

156
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,680
can be predicted.

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,639
As the last generation

158
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,680
on earth,

159
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,040
we will witness the end of the world.

160
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,120
Actually, it's quite romantic.

161
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,360
Especially we're at the best age,

162
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,399
when we're with the person we like the most.

163
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,120
Am I right?

164
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,560
You...

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
What are you trying to say?

166
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Yuan Ge, you know what?

167
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,879
When I first

168
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,360
saw you and Gu Qiao

169
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,480
walking past me,

170
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,800
talking and laughing,

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,360
I forgot to look at the road.

172
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,240
I fell into the sewer.

173
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,600
Since then,

174
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,000
you've been deeply engraved

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
in my heart.

176
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,480
I can't forget it.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,279
After that,

178
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,000
I pretended to

179
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,799
pass you by countless times.

180
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,440
Actually,

181
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
I just want to see you more often.

182
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,720
Our casual eye contact

183
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,480
made me lose sleep at night.

184
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,759
I'm sure

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,399
I have fallen deeply in love with you.

186
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,000
I also firmly believe that

187
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,200
you are the most perfect gift

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,799
from heaven.

189
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,200
Yuan Ge.

190
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,320
Would you like to join me

191
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,480
to welcome

192
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
the last minute of our life?

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Yes, I do.

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Come on.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
I don't know whether our performance

196
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,080
has brought back the memories of you two.

197
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,240
If there's something wrong

198
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
with our performance,

199
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,039
I hope you can forgive us.

200
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,720
Yes.

201
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,639
It's just that our director

202
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,440
has given us too little time.

203
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
- Yes.
- Okay,

204
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,879
let's welcome our director,

205
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,919
Mr. Du Bingwen.

206
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay.

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,919
Thank you.

208
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,360
Thank you.

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,639
Thank you.

210
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,600
Thank you, everyone.

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,240
Okay.

212
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
Let's go.

213
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,559
Let's go.

214
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,519
Du,

215
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,279
you're tampering with history.

216
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,759
I'll teach you a lesson in the future.

217
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,519
Leave her alone.

218
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
It's good.

219
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,960
It's really good.

220
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,519
It's much better than

221
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,240
the rehearsal.

222
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Although the plot is a bit different from the real story,

223
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,159
when I was holding the flowers

224
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,360
and standing at the door,

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
this was

226
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,480
the picture in my mind

227
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,759
before you came.

228
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,000
Maybe it's because when I was a kid,

229
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,960
those dramas

230
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,000
I watched were like this.

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,399
But I don't know why...

232
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Forget it.

233
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm happy now.

234
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,519
You've accepted me.

235
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,519
Although I don't know

236
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,559
why you somtimes

237
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,200
are aloof,

238
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,360
I think

239
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,000
this is the test of love.

240
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
When I was studying abroad,

241
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,320
I never had a foreign girlfriend.

242
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,039
I've never had a Chinese one either.

243
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
When others ask me

244
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,600
what love is like,

245
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,639
I can only think about your face.

246
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,879
You are my first love,

247
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,360
and I really want to continue

248
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,559
this beautiful love.

249
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,639
Don't be stressed out.

250
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,720
Really.

251
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,559
No pressure, okay?

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
No matter when it is,

253
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,279
I'll always be there for you.

254
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
No matter what happens,

255
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,480
I'll face it with you.

256
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,519
Yuan Ge,

257
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,200
I love you.

258
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,759
Lingling,

259
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,480
it's time

260
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
to go to bed.

261
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
I won't sleep.

262
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,000
What's wrong?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,080
Are you unhappy?

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
I miss Gu Qiao.

265
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,720
She hasn't come to see me

266
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,360
for a long time.

267
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Gu Qiao might be busy with work,

268
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,639
but when she's free,

269
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,120
she will come to see you.

270
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,480
Be good.

271
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,720
Sleep first, okay?

272
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,519
No.

273
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
Call her now.

274
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,039
Lingling, it's too late now.

275
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,679
I'll call her tomorrow

276
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,559
and ask her to come visit you when she's free.

277
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,120
Okay?

278
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,559
Don't lie to me.

279
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,399
I won't lie to you.

280
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,799
I'll keep my word.

281
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,360
Let's go to sleep.

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,039
Good girl.

283
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,720
Okay,

284
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,279
lie down.

285
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,600
Lingling, you're so good.

286
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,399
Go to sleep.

287
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,399
Gege, you're back.

288
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,039
You're back so late.

289
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,120
Did you get a room?

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,679
What are you thinking?

291
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,759
Didn't you?

292
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,360
Du Bingwen just treated me

293
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,399
to a simple meal.

294
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,639
He made such a big scene

295
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,919
but you just had a simple meal?

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,639
Or what?

297
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,759
I'm telling you,

298
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,919
the atmosphere has been set off.

299
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,720
Why is the rhythm falling?

300
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,559
Why did Du

301
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,159
become a fool at such a critical moment?

302
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:01,919
No way.

303
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,679
Let's change him.

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Why are you turning against him so quickly?

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,559
Didn't you trick me into going there today?

306
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,200
I want to know that

307
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
he slandered me like that,

308
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,559
I won't let you go.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
Gu Qiao,

310
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,159
don't be so petty.

311
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,840
You're not the focus today.

312
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,399
Yuan Ge,

313
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,120
you… You're ungrateful.

314
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,799
Now you're speaking for him.

315
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes, the focus is not me.

316
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:24,960
Put on the watch

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,080
I gave you tomorrow.

318
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,799
But I'm not that fat.

319
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Isn't it too obvious?

320
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,919
Are you texting him on WeChat?

321
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,399
Or what?

322
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't send it to him.

323
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
You're talking to me now.

324
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,480
You can only talk to me.

325
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,080
Why are you still sending it?

326
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,720
Stop sending it.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
No, you jerk.

328
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,919
Du, I'm telling you,

329
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm not done with you today.

330
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,039
From now on,

331
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,200
don't send my Gege WeChat messages.

332
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Otherwise, I'll beat you.

333
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,360
Brother,

334
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
get me some toilet paper.

335
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
There's no paper left in the bathroom.

336
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
Figure it out on your own.

337
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,120
No, hurry up.

338
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you know why the bathroom

339
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,679
is called "bathroom"?

340
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,639
What does it matter?

341
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,679
It means you need to wash your hands
when you're out,

342
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,399
so you can figure it out yourself.

343
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,279
Well,

344
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,039
Du Bingwen, just  get me some toilet paper.

345
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,360
Don't be so lazy, okay?

346
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
Hurry up.

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
Du Bingwen.

348
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
Du Bingwen.

349
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,200
Be careful. There are people here.

350
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,039
They'll see us.

351
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,440
Where are they?

352
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,960
They'll be here soon.

353
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,879
Gosh,

354
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,480
someone will find out.

355
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,840
Are you wearing your watch?

356
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,759
Watch echo.

357
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,119
Let me hug you for a while.

358
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,839
For a little while.

359
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,759
Okay, I got it.

360
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,319
I've arrived at the basement.

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,960
Hello, Mr. Du.

362
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,079
- Miss  Wang.
- Miss Yuan.

363
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,519
This one...

364
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,519
Please do not use the elevator
when there's a fire alarm.

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,799
Gu Qiao,

366
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,960
take a look at

367
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
the We-media accounts

368
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,519
Shumei will put in later.

369
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,119
It's been a long time

370
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,359
since there was update.

371
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:49,880
It can't be.

372
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,039
I've been following all of these.

373
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,599
The launch of GK is based on

374
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,799
Shumei's product positioning.

375
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,799
Pretty reliable.

376
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm not saying it's reliable or not.

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,039
Just

378
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,079
it's far worse

379
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,119
than Lisa's.

380
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,880
As you know,

381
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,240
Shumei, this fair-priced brand,

382
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,559
was promoted by my master

383
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,799
with hard work for many years.

384
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,279
But ever since the company had Lisa,

385
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,200
the whole advertisement putting
has been out of balance.

386
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,200
Gu Qiao,

387
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,720
you certainly don't want my master's hard work

388
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,559
all these years to go to waste, do you?

389
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,680
I know what you mean.

390
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,039
I'll discuss it with them.

391
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Thank you.

392
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,039
I'll go there first.

393
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,480
The resources distribution has priority

394
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,079
and the pre-sale of Lisa is coming soon.

395
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,359
We must concentrate our attention first

396
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,480
to clear the way for Lisa.

397
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,279
Shumei's classic facial mask

398
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,559
has been selling well.

399
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,480
Just keep maintaining its image.

400
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,519
The current resource ratio

401
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,720
is ideal.

402
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,799
But Lisa

403
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,119
is just one of our sub-brands.

404
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,359
And Shumei's classic facial mask

405
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,039
is our core competitiveness.

406
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,680
We can't risk big things for the sake of small things.

407
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,599
Please help me.

408
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
So what you're saying is,

409
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,880
we should promote Shumei

410
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,359
according to the ratio of resources given to Lisa.

411
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,079
But not all of them.

412
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,480
Just the new media.

413
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,960
Are you sure?

414
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,599
These accounts

415
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,680
have a high-end audience.

416
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,000
High-end is good.

417
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,240
Okay,

418
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,839
then later, I'll

419
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,160
ask them to make a list

420
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,799
and send you an email to confirm it.

421
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Thank you.

422
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,160
If you like this coffee,

423
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,480
I'll bring it to you next time.

424
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,880
I need to answer a call.

425
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,839
Hello.

426
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,400
There's a document

427
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,720
that you have to sign.

428
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,920
Can Du have dinner

429
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,119
with you?

430
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,480
Sure.

431
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,599
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

432
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,279
Lingling,

433
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,240
I want to apologize to you.

434
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,960
I didn't do

435
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,119
what I promised you before.

436
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,400
Please forgive me, okay?

437
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't blame you.

438
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,480
Thank you.

439
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,559
I'm leaving.

440
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,400
By the way, we had a deal.

441
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,720
Don't tell dad

442
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,039
about my presence here.

443
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,119
From now on,

444
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,880
you have to come to my house more often.

445
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,440
I'll come to see you whenever I have time.

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,039
Okay?

447
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,160
Okay.

448
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm leaving.

449
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,440
Goodbye.

450
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,119
Goodbye.

451
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,039
Be obedient.

452
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,119
Okay.

453
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,039
Miss Gu, are you leaving?

454
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
Please come to play with Lingling often.

455
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,319
Okay.

456
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,079
Lingling, dad is back.

457
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,240
Sir, you're back.

458
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,119
Did you behave yourself today?

459
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,799
Dad.

460
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,960
Do you miss me?

461
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
Yes.

462
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,319
Okay.

463
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
Dad,

464
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
what do you think of my drawing?

465
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,400
It's so beautiful.

466
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,559
Lingling is awesome.

467
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Why are you

468
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,599
in a good mood today?

469
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,559
Is someone here?

470
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,680
Miss Gu is here today.

471
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,319
She just left.

472
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
She didn't let me tell dad.

473
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,920
Sorry,

474
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,359
I don't know.

475
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,079
Dad,

476
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,920
you had a fight

477
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,079
with Miss Gu?

478
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,279
It's just a little conflict.

479
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,799
Please don't

480
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:36,200
make her angry in the future.

481
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,880
Okay, I got it.

482
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,519
Tonight,

483
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,279
I'll tell you a story.

484
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay?

485
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,000
No.

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,039
Dad's story is terrible.

487
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,359
I want Miss Gu to tell me a story.

488
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,119
Don't want me to tell stories?

489
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,160
Give me a hug.

490
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Dad,

491
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,839
can you

492
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,039
make up with Gu Qiao?

493
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,960
Lingling,

494
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,519
you like Gu Qiao so much?

495
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,559
Of course.

496
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,319
Gu Qiao can draw

497
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,720
and is good at telling stories too.

498
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,000
I really like her.

499
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,079
What are you looking at?

500
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
Steak.

501
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,400
What's so interesting about steak?

502
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,200
Even though we ordered

503
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
the same steak,

504
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,960
why do I think

505
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,960
yours tastes better?

506
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,359
Can you feed me one?

507
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,079
Du Bingwen,

508
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,160
we're in a public place.

509
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,920
It's far from the company.

510
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,240
No one will see it.

511
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,200
Who is too idle

512
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
to come all the way here for a meal?

513
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
Come on. I'm ready.

514
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
Ms. Yuan and Mr. Du.

515
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,519
I thought it was you two from afar.

516
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,880
It's really you.

517
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,720
What a coincidence.

518
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,720
Miss Wang,

519
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,559
I have an appointment with Mr. Du

520
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
to talk about the pre-sale of Lisa.

521
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,079
Capable people surely work harder.

522
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,279
After work,

523
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,680
you can't even have a meal at ease.

524
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,200
Go on with your conversation.

525
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,240
I won't bother you anymore.

526
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm leaving.

527
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Goodbye.

528
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,359
Tell me,

529
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,079
is she following us?

530
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,920
Why does she always bump into us?

531
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
Luckily, it's Miss Wang.

532
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,640
She won't talk nonsense in the company.

533
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,799
How do you know?

534
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,119
Women love gossip.

535
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,839
Because Miss Wang is my people.

536
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,599
She is yours,

537
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,160
then what am I to you?

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,240
Dog.

539
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,519
That's great.

540
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,319
The pre-sale volume of Lisa on the first day

541
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,240
far exceeded my expectations.

542
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
According to a preliminary estimate,

543
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
after Lisa went online,

544
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,680
quarterly profits

545
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,000
will increase tenfold.

546
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,519
Ms. Fu,

547
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,240
since Lisa is so popular,

548
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
I believe that after it's officially launched,

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
the supply will definitely have difficulty meeting the demands.

550
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,039
We might as well be prepared in advance.

551
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,839
What do you think of

552
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,839
additional production?

553
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,440
I think so, too.

554
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,640
What do you think?

555
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,960
Ms. Fu,

556
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,119
although the single-day pre-sale volume

557
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,480
of Lisa is very high,

558
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,240
what we need to consider is

559
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,400
the return rate in the later period,

560
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,680
and feedback from users

561
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,160
so as to avoid overstocking.

562
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,119
Bingwen,

563
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,559
why don't you say something?

564
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,559
The quality of Lisa's products

565
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,160
has been recognized

566
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,319
by the European market.

567
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,920
If there's nothing wrong

568
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,880
with sales and promotion,

569
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
anything that Ms. Yuan is worried about

570
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,319
would not happen.

571
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,799
You can rest assured.

572
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,200
Our product department

573
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
will also strengthen its control.

574
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,480
Even in the later stage,

575
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,000
if there is a problem of returning goods,

576
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,240
we will try our best to adjust it

577
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,480
and try not to lose

578
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,359
any customers.

579
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,279
All right, Gege,

580
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,920
since everyone has so much confidence

581
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,039
in Lisa,

582
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,880
we should strike the iron while it's hot.

583
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,559
Zhang Wei,

584
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,960
call the factory as soon as possible.

585
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,039
Tell them

586
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,680
we've decided

587
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,279
to double the order.

588
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,160
Okay.

589
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,160
Ms. Fu.

590
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,240
I just heard from the finance department a few days ago

591
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
that cash flow is tight.

592
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,599
If we double the orders,

593
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,799
wouldn't it be too risky?

594
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,279
How about this?

595
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,640
The best sales model is that

596
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,960
the product is always on the road.

597
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,680
To be safe,

598
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,440
it can be added

599
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,400
50% temporarily.

600
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,880
All right, then.

601
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,079
Bingwen, do as you say.

602
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,920
Add 50%.

603
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,720
By the way, Ms. Fu,

604
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,559
the budget for recycling fake goods in Zhoushan

605
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,519
has been calculated.

606
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,400
Take a look.

607
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,319
That's a lot of money.

608
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,119
Gege,

609
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,480
didn't you just say

610
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,799
you saw that

611
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,079
the cash flow on the account is tight?

612
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,400
Ms. Fu,

613
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,319
we can't

614
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,759
save this money anyway.

615
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,799
Money needs to be spent on important projects.

616
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,839
I'd like your opinions.

617
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,119
If you compare Lisa's

618
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,039
additional 50% order

619
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,039
with recycling

620
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,640
this batch of fake facial masks,

621
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,440
which one will be more urgent?

622
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,319
In fact, there are many fake and shoddy products

623
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,599
circulating

624
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,880
under the banner of Shumei in the market.

625
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,599
There is no way

626
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,759
to avoid this situation.

627
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,000
But this time,

628
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,240
it was Zhoushan Franchisee.

629
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
Ms. Fu has also said that

630
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,880
the store has been closed

631
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,000
and the dealer has been fired.

632
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,359
I think it's good enough

633
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,440
for our company

634
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,680
to do this far.

635
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,440
How about this?

636
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,759
Bingwen,

637
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:37,920
make an official statement

638
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,160
for the company

639
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,799
to remind consumers

640
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
to buy from official channels.

641
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,759
In addition,

642
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,920
you must concentrate on

643
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,559
operating Lisa.

644
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,920
This is the top priority

645
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,200
of all departments of the company now.

646
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
- Understood.
- Understood.

647
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,759
Understood.

648
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,720
Dismissed.

649
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,519
This Zhang Wei

650
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
keeps putting things off.

651
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,440
I guess it's Ms. Fu's idea.

652
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,480
She didn't really think about

653
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
recycling those fakes.

654
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,680
But

655
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,160
when I think about it from another angle,

656
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,599
if Lisa

657
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,880
goes on like this,

658
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,559
then, in the future,

659
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,400
it will be a great success.

660
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,160
This means that

661
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,519
Shumei can transform completely.

662
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,920
Maybe the previous users

663
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,039
are not that important

664
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,319
for us.

665
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,960
You heard it just now.

666
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,240
Cash flow is very tight now.

667
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,480
At this time,

668
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,079
you want Ms. Fu to give up the big
and protect the small?

669
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,359
I don't think it's possible.

670
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,839
Then I have to talk to Ms. Fu.

671
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,839
If we don't handle it

672
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,079
properly,

673
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,440
there definitely will be future troubles

674
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,319
to Shumei's good reputation.

675
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,319
What's more, it's not certain

676
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,480
what will happen to Lisa in the future.

677
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,480
You're right.

678
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,480
But don't go now.

679
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
People will think you're so aggressive

680
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,440
that you are trying to challenge her.

681
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,759
Well, calm down first,

682
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,759
and give Ms. Fu some time

683
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,000
to think about it.

684
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
I'll find a chance

685
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,440
to talk to Ms. Fu.

686
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,039
Okay, let's not talk about work.

687
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,359
What would you like to eat tonight?

688
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,880
I'll listen to you outside of work.

689
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,400
For everything?

690
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,920
Then I have to think about

691
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,440
what should I eat tonight.

692
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,960
I've seen

693
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,079
the first batch of ads.

694
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,119
GK is really attentive.

695
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,640
Ms. Fu. You're welcome.

696
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,359
We just did

697
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,480
what we had to do.

698
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Of course not.

699
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,880
Without the cooperation of GK,

700
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,279
our first batch of pre-sale results

701
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,480
wouldn't have been so good.

702
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,759
Thank you so much, Mr. Xiong.

703
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,720
In the past few years,

704
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,000
the consumption concept of domestic users

705
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,160
has been changing.

706
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,400
Lisa happened to take advantage of the situation.

707
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,279
Ms. Fu, you have good foresight.

708
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,359
To be honest,

709
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,279
at first, I thought

710
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,480
you were just acting on a whim.

711
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,720
I didn't expect you

712
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,799
to be so bold, Ms. Fu.

713
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,160
That is to say,

714
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
you think it's right

715
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,039
for Shumei to undergo transformation

716
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,079
and make high-end skin care products?

717
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,640
This is the market trend. You have to.

718
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,839
After all, Mr. Xiong has so many years

719
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,440
of experience in the international market.

720
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,599
I'm sure you're more knowledgeable

721
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,079
than me.

722
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,839
I have faith in your taste.

723
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,279
Thank you.

724
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,880
Mr. Xiong, take care.

725
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,720
He can't see me.

726
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,759
Miss Gu.

727
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,920
Do you have time?

728
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,880
I want to talk to you.

729
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
About what?

730
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,319
You get off work at 5: 00, right?

731
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll wait for you at the cafe downstairs.

732
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,400
See you later.

733
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,720
Who is it?

734
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,799
You scared the hell out of me.

735
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,960
I'm asking you. Who is it?

736
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,759
What does it have to do with you?

737
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,200
Miss Gu,

738
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,279
I asked you out today

739
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,279
to officially apologize to you.

740
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,599
Apologize.

741
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,359
After what happened last time,

742
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
I've been reflecting.

743
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,079
As a father,

744
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,960
I only care about my own thoughts,

745
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,199
and didn't think about my daughter's feelings.

746
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,599
Thank you for reminding me, Miss Gu.

747
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,639
No.

748
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,320
I did something wrong, too.

749
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,280
Actually, when I first

750
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,239
met you,

751
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,840
I've already joined Shumei.

752
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,519
I approached you

753
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,320
because I wanted you to work with Shumei.

754
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,079
When you asked me out,

755
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,719
I wanted to explain,

756
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,679
but I didn't figure out how to say it.

757
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,400
Later,

758
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,199
you asked me to tutor Lingling.

759
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,440
I'm afraid you might misunderstand me.

760
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,000
I just...

761
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,280
I don't know how to explain it.

762
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,679
You know what?

763
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,960
When I first found out that

764
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,880
you were working at Shumei,

765
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
I did feel

766
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,599
a little upset.

767
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,440
But after thinking about it,

768
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
you didn't lie to me.

769
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,400
Right?

770
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,559
Also,

771
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
I can see that

772
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,400
you are sincere to Lingling.

773
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,840
And Lingling

774
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,400
really likes you.

775
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,760
As for the rest,

776
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,119
it doesn't matter.

777
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,679
Don't you really want to know

778
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,239
about Lingling's mother?

779
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,039
Actually...

780
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,400
She passed away.

781
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Sorry, Mr. Xiong.

782
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,760
Lingling's mother had pancreatic cancer

783
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
three years ago.

784
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,199
When she found out,

785
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,679
it's too late to be treated.

786
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,960
At that time, Lingling was so little.

787
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,360
Her mother was worried that Lingling would be sad.

788
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
That's why she kept telling me

789
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,159
not to tell Lingling.

790
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,719
So in the past few years,

791
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
every time Lingling mentions her mother,

792
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,920
I'll pretend

793
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,400
to be angry.

794
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,360
Yes,

795
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,000
I know it's not the right way.

796
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,159
But I really don't want to see

797
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,039
Lingling sad.

798
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,679
So Miss Gu,

799
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,679
please help me keep this secret.

800
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,320
When Lingling grows up,

801
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll tell her

802
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,159
the truth myself.

803
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,760
Okay?

804
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,920
Don't worry.

805
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
Mr. Xiong, I'm sorry.

806
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,719
When I didn't know

807
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,480
what was going on,

808
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,760
I said you're an

809
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,039
incompetent father.

810
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
I was too reckless.

811
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,960
It's okay. It's all in the past.

812
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,760
Miss Gu.

813
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,639
You...

814
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,679
You can call me Gu Qiao from now on.

815
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,719
Sure.

816
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,679
Then I don't need

817
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,360
to visit

818
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,519
Lingling secretly.

819
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,239
Of course,

820
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,119
our agreement remains the same.

821
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,679
I didn't go to accompany Lingling

822
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,719
for reward.

823
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,559
So you don't have to

824
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,360
pay me anymore.

825
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Okay, I respect you.

826
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,079
By the way, Miss Gu.

827
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,199
Gu Qiao.

828
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,880
Tomorrow is Lingling's birthday.

829
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,039
If you're free,

830
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,360
I'd like to invite you

831
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,840
to Lingling's birthday party.

832
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,920
Sure. I'll definitely go.

833
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,960
That's great.

834
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,000
Lingling must be very happy.

835
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,360
I have work to do,

836
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,159
so I'll get going.

837
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,519
Okay.

838
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,519
See you tomorrow.

839
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,079
She must be very happy.

840
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,199
Just call me Gu Qiao.

841
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,320
I can't even call you Gu Qiao.

842
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,519
Why can he do that?

843
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,840
What are you doing here?

844
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,440
Nothing.

845
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,239
I like coffee.

846
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,800
If you want some, it's on me.

847
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,400
Gu Qiao,

848
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,719
you are quite familiar with the boss of GK.

849
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,800
Is he going after you?

850
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
Don't talk nonsense.

851
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,199
And call me Miss Gu.

852
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,159
Gu Qiao is not something

853
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,159
a kid like you can call me.

854
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm not a kid.

855
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,719
Hao Shuai,

856
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,199
I know what you're thinking.

857
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,199
But today,

858
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,239
I also want to tell you clearly.

859
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,519
It's impossible between us.

860
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,840
When I was your age,

861
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,199
I used to be impulsive and willful.

862
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,559
But now,

863
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,559
I want to focus all my energy

864
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,840
on my career.

865
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,079
Even if I want to find a boyfriend,

866
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,880
I will find a mature and composed one.

867
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,119
Do you understand?

868
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
So you're looking for

869
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,039
that boss, right?

870
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:25,880
Yes.

871
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,400
I know he's more mature,

872
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,280
more composed,

873
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,000
and richer than me.

874
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,280
But when I reach his age,

875
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
I'll definitely be more attractive

876
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,039
and richer than him.

877
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,039
Brother,

878
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,360
lend me a suit.

879
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,119
Sure.

880
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,480
Help yourself. It's in the closet.

881
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,559
How about this one?

882
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,719
You asked me after you were dressed?

883
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,719
Is this borrowing?

884
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Why isn't it borrowing?

885
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,920
Didn't I just tell you?

886
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,199
What if I'm not at home?

887
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,519
If you weren't here,

888
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,360
it would be easy.

889
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,719
I can make my own decisions.

890
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,239
Where are the glasses

891
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:24,679
you wore last time?

892
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,239
They're handsome.

893
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,000
Lend them to me.

894
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,639
Do you think

895
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,800
it's necessary to ask me?

896
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,960
Why isn't it necessary?

897
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,880
You're here.

898
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,039
I'll make the call when I'm here, right?

899
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,480
Take off your clothes.

900
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,000
I don't want to lend them.

901
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,000
No, no, no.

902
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,559
I'll buy my own glasses.

903
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,159
I'm leaving.

904
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,000
Good morning.

905
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,599
Morning.

906
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,440
So handsome.

907
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,400
That's right.

908
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,880
Why are you wearing a suit?

909
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,360
Cool.

910
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,119
You're...

911
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,360
So cool.

912
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,000
What's wrong with you today?

913
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,679
Do I look

914
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,880
more mature than usual?

915
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,920
And you're even more handsome.

916
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,960
That's right.

917
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,239
All right, stop posing.

918
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,679
Lisa's gift boxes have arrived.

919
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,320
Later,

920
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,119
you go and count them

921
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,239
and send them to this address.

922
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,239
Okay.

923
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,920
Morning.

924
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,079
Morning.

925
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,920
What do you think?

926
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,119
Am I mature and composed?

927
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,760
Are you out of your mind?

928
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,639
Don't you like this type?

929
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,239
Yes.

930
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
But not you.

931
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:11,920
So annoying.

932
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:12,840
Gosh.

933
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,000
Shy again.
