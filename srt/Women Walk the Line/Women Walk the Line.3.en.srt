1
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,079
This red jujube porridge is the best for invigorating qi and blood.

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,040
-Eat more. -Thank

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
you, Mei.

4
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,879
By the way, Mei,

5
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,959
this is an IOU,

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,719
Thanks for the 2million interest

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,000
you lent me,

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,959
I wrote it

9
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,560
according to 4%.

10
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,359
Is there anything wrong with it?

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Ge Zi,

12
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,319
you've been following me

13
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,239
since graduation.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
I've always treated you

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,759
like my own sister,

16
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,919
Why are you still being such a stranger to me?

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,800
If I keep doing this, I'll be angry.

18
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,639
Mei,

19
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
I see.

20
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,439
Ge Zi,

21
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,479
over the years,

22
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,680
I left everything about the company

23
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,080
to you.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,319
I made you

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,599
look like a female man.

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,199
When it comes to work,

27
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,759
you can handle it with ease,

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,039
But what about life?

29
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,159
It's not just about work,

30
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,639
but also about relationships.

31
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,439
I've been there before,

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,039
so I'm deeply touched.

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
Back then, if I hadn't

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
put all my energy

35
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,159
into work.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,039
I won't get divorced.

37
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,800
And Baona won't leave me.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,759
It's not that easy for me

39
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,879
to see my child now.

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,759
But what's the use of regretting it?

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
So what about my sister?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
I don't want you

43
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
to have regrets in your life.

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,800
At the right age,

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
you should do the right thing.

46
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,960
Enjoy the moment,

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,639
enjoy the youth,

48
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,919
Enjoy love.

49
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,719
Thank you, Mei.

50
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
I've taken down everything you said.

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
Well,

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,039
The Mr. Zheng

53
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,000
I told you about before,

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,439
Do you want to think about it?

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,159
Okay.

56
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,479
I'll arrange it for both of you

57
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,240
later.

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll listen to Mei.

59
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,599
Eat up.

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,439
You must be Chuchu.

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,959
I look even better than in the photo.

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Your bag is here.

63
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm sorry,

64
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,319
This one

65
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,319
Louis Vuitton,

66
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,319
This one

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,519
It's pink that girls like.

68
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,560
This lambskin one,

69
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,959
and this

70
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,519
stray bag,

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,399
And the last one,

72
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,720
this is what you want.

73
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,040
This is lambskin.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,360
It's easy to scratch.

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,879
Be a little lighter.

76
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,040
Is this a fake bag?

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,519
Chanel

78
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,639
has never produced this style, right?

79
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,959
And the color

80
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,720
is not quite right.

81
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,120
This is a seasonal model,

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,319
and there are certificates

83
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:13,879
in it.

84
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,560
It was bought by the counter. Don't worry.

85
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,319
As for the color,

86
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,240
if you take off your sunglasses,

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,800
The effect will be better.

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,560
Sunglasses are for eye protection.

89
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,439
Girls are most afraid of the sun.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
It's easy to get old,

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,000
Well,

92
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,519
Why don't you sit inside?

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,600
It won't look good to take pictures inside.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,360
Taking pictures?

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
I have to try

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,639
taking pictures. Isn't it good?

97
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,240
Am I right?

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,519
By the way,

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,439
how many photos can you take for me?

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,079
Me

101
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,560
Here you are.

102
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,480
By the way,

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,560
Put these bags away.

104
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,519
Put it over there.

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Hurry up!

106
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,240
Hurry up!

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
Don't bring other bags with you.

108
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Only this one.

109
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,560
Can you get it?

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Is that okay?

111
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,920
You need to highlight this bag.

112
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,639
The bag is the point.

113
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,879
All right,

114
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
Give me a few more.

115
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,160
Come on.

116
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,079
Move it. Move it.

117
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,399
Stand and shoot.

118
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,560
Pass me that

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,199
Louis Vuitton.

120
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,720
Thank you.

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,879
I want the whole body type.

122
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,399
You made me look

123
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,319
taller and thinner,

124
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,040
And highlight this bag,

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,800
the whole bag.

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,519
Take a look.

127
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,079
Well,

128
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,000
can you make this cheaper?

129
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,480
I only recited this once or twice.

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,519
And the texture is very new,

131
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,560
but the hardware,

132
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
It looks so old,

133
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
and you keep it

134
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,959
at home,

135
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,319
Am I right?

136
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,920
It's not like this,

137
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,800
this hardware is like this,

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,920
This model is for the old one,

139
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,560
and it's 1000 yuan cheaper.

140
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,279
1000 yuan?

141
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,120
You agreed?

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll transfer the money right now.

143
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,959
All right. I'll give you 1000 yuan cheaper.

144
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,639
Turn around.

145
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll transfer it to you now.

146
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,639
So I took the bag.

147
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,319
No,

148
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,279
these three are also what you want.

149
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,560
Would you like to join us?

150
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
If I don't like those three,

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
of course I don't want them.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
When you took the photo,

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
you didn't force me to buy and sell, did you?

154
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
No, I won't.

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
I've transferred the money to you.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I took the bag.

157
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,079
Thank you.

158
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,279
If you really don't have anything to do,

159
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,560
why don't you think about your next plan?

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,439
Even if you don't have a goal,

161
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,519
you should at least have a direction.

162
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,200
Hello, Miss.

163
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,120
Do you want to buy flowers?

164
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,519
Is this store going to be transferred?

165
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,759
Yes.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm going back to my hometown.

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
So I plan to transfer the store out.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,919
How much does it cost to take this store?

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,000
There is no need to pay

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,759
any extra fees.

171
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,679
I'm not going to take

172
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,759
these things with me.

173
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,399
I just need to pay the rent.

174
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,480
How much is the rent?

175
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,720
If the rent

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
is 500 houses a year,

177
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,120
Thank you.

178
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,159
You're welcome.

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,399
Welcome.

180
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,399
Hello,

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
are you the manager?

182
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Hello,

183
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,840
how can I help you?

184
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,399
I want to ask,

185
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,720
if you open this coffee shop,

186
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,559
How much do you need?

187
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,879
Our store is a chain brand,

188
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,080
and the franchise fee is 300 thousand.

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,600
You can contact our official for details.

190
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,919
This is our business card.

191
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,559
It's only 300 thousand.

192
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,240
300 thousand doesn't sound like much,

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,559
but it's just an initial fee.

194
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,399
And buying equipment and raw materials.

195
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
As well as the salary of our employees,

196
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
plus the rental of this store,

197
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,759
That might add up to 1 million smaller.

198
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,639
Thank you.

199
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,759
I've read your plan.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,919
What do you think?

201
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,720
Nice plan,

202
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
But

203
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,679
Unrealistic.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Divanon Weiss is

205
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,679
an international high-end luxury brand.

206
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,799
He never works with domestic brands,

207
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,759
let alone co-brands.

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,039
What if I can do it?

209
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,120
Don't be like this.

210
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,840
Why is it still the same?

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,759
What I can't do,

212
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,960
I don't think anyone can do it.

213
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,200
If you're really confident,

214
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,879
prove it with your actions.

215
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,279
Are you sure

216
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,639
you have time tonight?

217
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,919
When our old classmates meet again,

218
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,759
we'll have dinner together tonight,

219
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,639
Let's catch up.

220
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,960
No, thanks.

221
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,159
I'm not that close

222
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,960
to you.

223
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,399
The person in charge of Duvernon Weiss.

224
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:37,720
Brian,

225
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,159
I asked him to come to Shanghai.

226
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,600
We're going to have dinner together tonight,

227
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,559
and talk about the cooperation.

228
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,960
If Mr. Yuan is not busy,

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,039
come and check it out.

230
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm serious.

231
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,440
Can't you drive by yourself?

232
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,960
Our domestic driver's license hasn't come down yet.

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
That's it.

234
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,799
I used to come here when I was in school,

235
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,600
for so many years,

236
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
It really hasn't changed at all.

237
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,480
But as soon as I came here,

238
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,559
I remembered a lot of things that happened back then.

239
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,240
It's so exciting.

240
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on. Stop dancing.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
Eat something.

242
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,639
You bought so much food,

243
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,559
and you picked up money?

244
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,799
That's right.

245
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,399
I bought it with my monthly living expenses,

246
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,039
Come on,

247
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,600
The living expenses

248
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,279
are too much.

249
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,679
The end of the world

250
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,519
won't pass anyway,

251
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,480
It has to be over.

252
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,759
But if you didn't spend the money,

253
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,080
thank you.

254
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,919
You also believe that?

255
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,840
3:

256
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,480
10: 34: 30 this afternoon,

257
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,879
How precise.

258
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
How can you not believe me?

259
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,600
Have you ever thought about

260
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
what if there's no end to the world?

261
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,279
What are you going to do?

262
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
Then every day

263
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,279
will be the end of my life.

264
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
I heard on the Internet,

265
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
if I can confess my love

266
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,519
before the end of the world,

267
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
So you can hit every single shot,

268
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
and,

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,799
I can face the end of the world

270
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,240
with the one I love.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,840
But even if you play without a false shot,

272
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,879
you have to have a target first.

273
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,679
Even if you have a goal,

274
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,879
you have to have time.

275
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,799
That's right.

276
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,600
Now,

277
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,919
there's only over an hour left.

278
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,080
Maybe

279
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
we're all done.

280
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,159
Bingwen,

281
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,519
where are you going?

282
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Gu Qiao.

283
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,879
You're so polite.

284
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,919
You even used flowers

285
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,799
to blame me. Sorry,

286
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,600
It's not for you.

287
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,000
Do me a favor.

288
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,679
I don't have time.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
On what terms? You said

290
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,799
I really wanted to

291
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,960
eat Japanese food before,

292
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,960
I'll treat you

293
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,399
later. There are two more papers,

294
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,159
-I'll write you

295
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,960
a deal. -Tell me. What is it?

296
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,480
Call Yuan Ge down for me.

297
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,440
That's it

298
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,559
All right, wait.

299
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,679
Hurry up. We don't have much time.

300
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,600
Got it.

301
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,240
Run two steps,

302
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Beg me

303
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,159
Run for two steps,

304
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,200
run for two steps,

305
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
If you keep doing this, I won't go.

306
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,519
Go, go, go.

307
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,559
Do you still remember?

308
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,360
What are you talking about, Mr. Du?

309
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't remember.

310
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,039
Forget it.

311
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
Forget it.

312
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Someone is looking for you

313
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,200
downstairs. Who is it?

314
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't know either.

315
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,960
You'll find out after you go down and have a look.

316
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Let's go!

317
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,799
Wait.

318
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Something came up.

319
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
Go back to the dorm with me first.

320
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,080
Let's go.

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,759
Cover it better,

322
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,679
Let's go.

323
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,599
The person who just came to see you,

324
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,440
why is he missing?

325
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,400
It's so strange,

326
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,240
Gu Qiao.

327
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,319
Mr. Xu wants to see you.

328
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,559
He wants you to go to his office.

329
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
If the teacher wants to see me,

330
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
you can go first.

331
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,079
Gu Qiao,

332
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,279
Yuan Ge,

333
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,240
I like you.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,079
For no reason,

335
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,039
Yuan Ge,

336
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,319
Do you believe in the end of the world?

337
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,720
I think there is no absolute thing in the world.

338
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
Dinosaurs can be exterminated.

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,039
Then the end of the human world,

340
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,119
can be predicted.

341
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,319
As the last generation

342
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,119
on earth,

343
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,599
we will witness the end of the world.

344
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,720
Actually, it's quite romantic.

345
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
Especially at the best age,

346
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
when you're with the person you like the most.

347
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,799
Am I right?

348
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,720
Listen to me.

349
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,000
You're in trouble.

350
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,359
Really?

351
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
I'm not lying.

352
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm not lying.

353
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,920
Yuan Ge.

354
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
We haven't seen each other for so many years,

355
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,079
you really haven't changed at all?

356
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,880
You're still so cold.

357
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,480
I don't understand.

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
You have such

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,079
a beautiful resume,

360
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,720
You can join any company.

361
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,559
As an executive,

362
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,960
why do you have to come to Shu Mei?

363
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,240
As my subordinate,

364
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,319
I have to say,

365
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,559
I came back to chase you.

366
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,119
Do you believe it?

367
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,960
The red lights in Shanghai are so long.

368
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,039
Tell me,

369
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,480
should I give you two

370
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,519
a name.

371
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,039
You guys just call me

372
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,880
Ge Ge

373
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,400
He Qiao

374
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,480
Ge Ge, you're back.

375
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,400
You're back.

376
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,799
Come on,

377
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,480
Look,

378
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,680
I took your house from President Feng,

379
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,079
It turned into an idyllic country style.

380
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,000
I feel like

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,599
I'm full of life now.

382
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,240
Not bad.

383
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,079
What is this?

384
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,039
Crab,

385
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,599
do you know its name?

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,799
What's your name?

387
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,599
It's called "Crab",

388
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,960
which means we're going to be together,

389
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,079
For a long time.

390
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,079
Never separate.

391
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,960
That's a good moral.

392
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm going to take a shower.

393
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,880
You have your period?

394
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,200
No, I bought it for you.

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
He bought it for me.

396
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,160
When I cleaned up your locker,

397
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,279
I found many

398
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,720
expired sanitary pads in it,

399
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,480
If it weren't for me,

400
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,359
all the sanitary pads you used

401
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,160
in the next few months

402
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
would have expired,

403
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,960
If you touch my stuff next time,

404
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,799
could you tell me in advance?

405
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,119
I'm sorry,

406
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,359
I just threw away the sanitary pads,

407
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,359
I didn't move anything else.

408
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,200
She's angry.

409
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,559
Did I do something wrong?

410
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,839
Early-onset

411
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,079
ovarian dysfunction,

412
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,799
Commonly known as premature ovarian failure,

413
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,200
the clinical manifestation is

414
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,279
secondary amenorrhea.

415
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,000
And infertility.

416
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,480
You have to pay attention to it.

417
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,680
If it goes on like this,

418
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,640
you'll lose

419
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
your fertility completely.

420
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,759
You didn't eat breakfast again.

421
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,200
You're really mad.

422
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello,

423
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,519
you're not allowed to enter without an access card.

424
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,960
Please lean back.

425
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,880
Then you can swipe your card for me.

426
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,599
Excuse Me

427
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,680
Do you work here?

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,599
No,

429
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,200
that won't do.

430
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,519
I just came to deliver something.

431
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,359
I'll leave after seeing you off.

432
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
I know your vice president.

433
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,720
That won't do.

434
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,839
Why don't I

435
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,880
call your vice president?

436
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,799
Sure.

437
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,319
Isn't the surprise gone?

438
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,359
Second Brother Du,

439
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,119
why are you here?

440
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,160
You swipe your card first and let me in.

441
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,000
Come on.

442
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,519
Didn't you go back to your hometown and get married?

443
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes.

444
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,720
Congratulations.

445
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,880
I mean, you're a man,

446
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,599
You're so poor.

447
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,039
What do you do in Shanghai now?

448
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,599
Being idle at home,

449
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,759
I'm going to make a career

450
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,960
in Shanghai,

451
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,759
You're so good,

452
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,839
you can do anything.

453
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,039
You're more sophisticated than her.

454
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,960
If you stay in Shanghai,

455
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,119
you'll do better than her.

456
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,559
She should study abroad.

457
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,359
Are you sure?

458
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,559
Well,

459
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,799
thank you.

460
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,799
Why are you here?

461
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,640
Do you miss me?

462
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,400
Have you had breakfast?

463
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,240
I haven't had time yet.

464
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,759
See?

465
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,079
I knew it.

466
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,240
I brought you breakfast.

467
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,119
Come on,

468
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,799
There's porridge.

469
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,480
I've eaten it.

470
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,200
I'll eat it later.

471
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,880
No, you can eat it now.

472
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,240
Do you want to eat together?

473
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,839
Is that okay?

474
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,640
Mr. Du,

475
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,960
aren't you busy?

476
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,119
I'm busy.

477
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,039
Call me if you need anything.

478
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,000
Eat it.

479
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,599
Try it.

480
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,240
Your office

481
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,720
is so big.

482
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,240
You have a good view.

483
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,960
Does your company still hire people?

484
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,759
Not for now.

485
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,440
By the way,

486
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,200
what happened yesterday was my fault,

487
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,440
From now on,

488
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,559
I'll touch your stuff.

489
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,079
I'll tell you in advance.

490
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,279
Why are you laughing?

491
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,960
If I don't accept your apology,

492
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,279
you'll come

493
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,720
to deliver food to me every day.

494
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,960
You wish.

495
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,920
Master,

496
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,240
what happened to Zaoyanxi?

497
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,839
Gu Qiao is here too.

498
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,400
Nothing.

499
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,759
I'm just reminding you,

500
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,680
remember to sign the document,

501
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,319
-Use it well

502
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
this afternoon. -I remember. Go

503
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,079
back to work.

504
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,559
Goodbye, Gu Qiao.

505
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,799
Ge Ge,

506
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,200
I think she brought you breakfast.

507
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,400
Really?

508
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,720
But you can only

509
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,720
eat my breakfast today.

510
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,640
No.

511
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,920
You have to eat them all the time.

512
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
I make breakfast for you.

513
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,160
I make breakfast for you every day.

514
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:01,920
Xia Meng,

515
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,799
have you eaten?

516
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,839
Not yet.

517
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,799
You're welcome.

518
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,680
Hello, do you have an appointment?

519
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,240
The reservation is made by Mr. Zheng

520
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,279
Okay

521
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,960
Here's your lemonade,

522
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,160
Thank you.

523
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,119
All right.

524
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,640
Go back and wait for our notice.

525
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,079
Okay. Thank you.

526
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,640
Next.

527
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,720
Gu Qiao

528
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,039
Hello, I'm Gu Qiao.

529
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,160
This is my resume.

530
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,960
I don't have any work experience.

531
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
What's going on?

532
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
I got it wrong.

533
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,519
It has the same name.

534
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,720
I sent the wrong email.

535
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,839
Sorry,

536
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,759
you didn't pass

537
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,960
our resume screening,

538
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,039
We made a mistake.

539
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm sorry to make you come here for nothing.

540
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,039
May I ask why?

541
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,599
Here's the thing.

542
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,559
Our requirement is,

543
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,400
more than three years of working experience,

544
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,519
You haven't had it for a year,

545
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,359
I don't have much work experience,

546
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
But I'm from Jiangdong University,

547
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,599
and I also belong to 221,

548
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,039
If you give me a chance,

549
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,119
I will try my best.

550
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,119
Shanghai graduates

551
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,880
with bachelor degree or above

552
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
in 985 and 2111 every year,

553
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,759
Do you know how many?

554
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,000
Next.

555
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,160
Jiang Andi.

556
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,200
Hello,

557
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,079
I'm sorry.

558
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,960
Hello, this is my resume.

559
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,440
Are you looking for

560
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,720
other positions?

561
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,599
For those who want to recruit now,

562
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,160
they all need to have work experience.

563
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,759
Where's the receptionist?

564
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,519
You don't need work experience at the front desk, do you?

565
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,119
The receptionist wants someone who just graduated

566
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
from college. Hello. I just graduated from college.

567
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,920
I'm here to interview

568
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,200
the receptionist,

569
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,279
what are your salary requirements?

570
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,319
My request

571
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,440
has been written on my resume.

572
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
-You can have a

573
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,559
look. -Okay.

574
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,359
Since you didn't find him,

575
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,559
you even hit me.

576
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,839
I think it's necessary

577
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,759
to get to know each other now.

578
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,319
You don't need to know me.

579
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,960
Zheng Jinnan.

580
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,839
It seems that the world

581
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,240
is too small.

582
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Maybe we are destined

583
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,160
to have some fate.

584
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,400
Sorry,

585
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,440
I don't want to have any fate with you.

586
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,680
Miss Yuan,

587
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,240
you seem to have a prejudice against me.

588
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,920
Yes,

589
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
but I don't think Miss Yuan

590
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,680
really knows me.

591
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,599
Isn't it a bit subjective

592
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,359
to reject people like this?

593
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,640
Since Mr. Fu introduced you here,

594
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,240
I think,

595
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,359
Let's leave more time

596
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:20,960
for each other

597
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,000
to get to know each other.

598
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,720
That's not necessary.

599
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,000
I won't tell you

600
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,440
what Mr. Fu shouldn't say.

601
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,359
Miss Yuan,

602
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,799
it seems hard for me to change

603
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,200
your initial impression of me, right?

604
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,319
You can be more confident.

605
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,119
Ge Ge,

606
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,400
come and have a drink with me.

607
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,799
Okay.

608
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,000
How was the blind date?

609
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
Tell me,

610
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,920
is he handsome?

611
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,360
He didn't like you.

612
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,400
Or you don't like him?

613
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,480
You might not believe it,

614
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,599
but you know him?

615
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,119
I know him.

616
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:17,880
Who is he?

617
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,559
Berry Hotel,

618
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,039
1130,

619
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,000
He,

620
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,360
It's such a small world.

621
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,760
Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about you.

622
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,679
How was the interview?

623
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,679
Did it go well?

624
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
They said they made a mistake.

625
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,119
I'm not the one who interviewed you.

626
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't lose heart.

627
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,039
There's always a chance.

628
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,760
Let's work hard together.

629
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You deserve the best man

630
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,199
Come on.

631
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,199
Mr. Yuan,

632
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,920
what a coincidence.

633
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,840
What a fate.

634
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,000
Didn't you go to Switzerland on business?

635
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,880
A week's round trip

636
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,639
is just right. It's efficient.

637
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,320
I just don't know

638
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,360
how the harvest is?

639
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,079
Maybe the position of Vice President

640
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,159
will be mine soon.

641
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,519
When I become the vice president,

642
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,039
I'll marry you.

643
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,679
Then you'd better wash up and sleep.

644
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,199
Mr. Yuan,

645
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,519
Mr. Fu is waiting for you

646
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,480
at the cafe downstairs.

647
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,119
By the way, Mr. Yuan,

648
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,440
here are your flowers.

649
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,639
Who gave it to you?

650
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,280
Zheng Jinnan's

651
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,719
suitor?

652
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,159
Does it have anything to do with you?

653
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,559
Of course not.

654
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,599
I'm just asking.

655
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
Don't be so nervous.

656
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,719
Big news. Big news.

657
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,559
Someone sent flowers to Mr.

658
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,119
Yuan. Mr. Yuan is in love,

659
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,039
Really?

660
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,760
I guess it's a client.

661
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,440
It's a pity that Mr. Yuan threw away the flowers,

662
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,360
wasting his feelings,

663
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,119
Can you tell me the truth next time?

664
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:05,679
No,

665
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,639
I think,

666
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,519
Mr. Yuan,

667
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm sure you've been having romantic luck lately,

668
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,480
Don't. What do you think?

669
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,639
How is that possible?

670
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,000
Sago cycas can still

671
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,880
blossom. Get back to work.

672
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,559
We'll see if you don't believe me.

673
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,679
I can see that

674
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,760
you are a very careful person.

675
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,920
You flatter me.

676
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,079
Gezi,

677
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,000
Mr. Fu,

678
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,519
Sit down.

679
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,039
Just now,

680
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,760
Zheng kept asking me in front of me,

681
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
For your taste,

682
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,639
you ordered

683
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,039
your favorite desserts,

684
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Zheng always praises you in front of me,

685
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,920
saying that you are generous and decent.

686
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,400
Mei,

687
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,880
thank you for your introduction,

688
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,559
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known Yuan Ge.

689
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,920
Don't mention it.

690
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,760
I still have things to do.

691
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,639
I don't want to eat.

692
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,559
I'm going back to the office.

693
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,840
Here you are.

694
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,519
Leave more private space,

695
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,800
and you can have a talk.

696
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,719
Okay.

697
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,599
Thank you, Mei.

698
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Sit down.

699
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Thank you, Mei.

700
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,679
What do you mean?

701
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,480
Have you received the flowers?

702
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,679
Throw it away. Was it

703
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,079
because I wasn't clear enough

704
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,239
last time?

705
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,880
We are not suitable for each other.

706
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,960
Yuan Ge,

707
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
I think you might have

708
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
some prejudice against me.

709
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,480
Because the first impression,

710
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,559
completely negating a person,

711
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,480
I think

712
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,239
it's a very stupid thing to do.

713
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,159
What do you think?

714
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,039
I think,

715
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:52,719
I clearly know that

716
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,880
he is not a good person.

717
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,039
It's a waste of time.

718
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,360
That's the stupid thing to do.

719
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,320
Even if you don't trust me,

720
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,760
you should trust Mr. Fu, right?

721
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,599
How about this?

722
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,119
Give me a chance,

723
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,719
For a month,

724
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,039
let's get along well.

725
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
Maybe,

726
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,039
you can break your prejudice against me.

727
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:14,920
Sorry,

728
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,320
I don't have the time.

729
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,079
Does your company still hire people?

730
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,320
Not for now.

731
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,599
When I was in the spa,

732
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,920
I fell asleep.

733
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,159
He didn't say a word.

734
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,159
By the way,

735
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,119
you said

736
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,239
you had something to tell me.

737
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,079
What is it?

738
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,920
When I swiped the recruitment information,

739
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,519
I saw that Shu Mei was hiring,

740
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,840
But when I asked you that day,

741
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,480
did you say no?

742
00:40:59,119 --> 00:40:59,960
Gu Qiao,

743
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,039
you went back to your hometown after graduation.

744
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,639
I haven't worked seriously

745
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,679
for a day,

746
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,760
For Shumei's job requirements,

747
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,199
she needs to have work experience.

748
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,280
Ge Ge, I'm not

749
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
talking about work,

750
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,719
If you don't think I'm suitable,

751
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,559
you can tell me,

752
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,239
But you have no reason to lie to me.

753
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,320
Because you're my best friend,

754
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,360
if you want to come to Shu Mei,

755
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,800
I will definitely find a way.

756
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,559
But if,

757
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
if you want to interview for

758
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,639
a position in the company,

759
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,559
From the company's point of view,

760
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,599
I can't use you.

761
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,199
You just came to Shanghai,

762
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,519
I don't want you to lose confidence

763
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,320
before you

764
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,559
get used to the environment here,

765
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,679
In fact, what you need most right now

766
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,920
is a transition period,

767
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
To get familiar with the market atmosphere here.

768
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,440
And the rules of survival in the workplace,

769
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,159
this is Shanghai,

770
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,920
No one

771
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,320
can succeed casually.

772
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,840
What you need to do now,

773
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
is to start from scratch,

774
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,559
You have to work harder than others.

775
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,360
Ge Ge,

776
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,559
everything you just said,

777
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,079
I understand.

778
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,639
When I decided

779
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,159
to come to Shanghai from my hometown,

780
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,519
So I thought everything through.

781
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,239
I'm willing to start from scratch.

782
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,079
Let me ask you if Shu Mei wants to hire someone?

783
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,280
I don't want you

784
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,239
to help me get a job.

785
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,639
What I care about is,

786
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,760
you're my best friend,

787
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,719
I want you to be honest with me.

788
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,159
I don't want you to lie to me.

789
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,480
Are you satisfied with

790
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,320
our technician's service?

791
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,719
Here's the thing.

792
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,480
Our store is having an event right now,

793
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,320
Would you like to consider getting a card?

794
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,440
Do you hire people here?
