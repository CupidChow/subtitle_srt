1
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,199
You're awake.

2
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,280
What do you think?

3
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,879
Are you feeling unwell?

4
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm dying.

5
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll call the doctor.

6
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,759
Wait.

7
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
I have something to tell you.

8
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,400
Tell me,

9
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,280
I can see you as soon as I wake up.

10
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
I feel very happy.

11
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,599
I'll die without regrets.

12
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,479
She just woke up and started acting poor.

13
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll inform the doctor.

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't go.

15
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,240
Stay with me for a while.

16
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,719
I'm not that serious.

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
You're so worried about me,

18
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,240
but I'm worried about Shumei.

19
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,560
If you don't wake up,

20
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,319
Shu Mei will be in big trouble.

21
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,960
Are you worried about me?

22
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Or are you worried about Shumei?

23
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,400
Of course I'm worried about Shu Mei.

24
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,080
duplicity.

25
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,639
I've seen through you.

26
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,919
See through what?

27
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,759
I'll call the doctor.

28
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,919
You're not successful enough,

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,120
but you're not good enough.

30
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,639
I even drank foreign ink.

31
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,879
You can't even do a little thing well.

32
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,079
What's wrong?

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,879
Gu Qiao,

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,279
kids are so scary now.

35
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,319
What you worked so hard

36
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,800
for the other day,

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
As for the results of the questionnaire,

38
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,319
he threw them all away.

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
What's going on?

40
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,519
Wang Mei didn't tell me

41
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,240
that you've switched it

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,959
to electronic gear.

43
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,120
Isn't the paper useless?

44
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,240
Wouldn't it be better

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,519
if I sold it to the junk lady?

46
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,319
Me,

47
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,199
Don't throw the pot around.

48
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,720
What I mean is,

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
Gu Qiao put your work,

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
It's done.

51
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,839
You have to thank him.

52
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,519
No one has ever told you,

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,279
even if it's junk files,

54
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,879
Do you have to take photos and file them

55
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,079
before you can deal with them?

56
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,399
Manager Zheng, it's my fault,

57
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,680
because I have too many things on my desk,

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,160
Ask him to keep it for me for now.

59
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,519
But I forgot about it.

60
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,199
Gu Qiao,

61
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,040
stop defending him.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
There's something wrong with his attitude.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,079
How about this

64
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,639
I can't grow up in any company.

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
Manager Zheng, are you done scolding?

66
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,759
After scolding me, I went to the bathroom.

67
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,000
Me,

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
What do you think of his attitude?

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,519
He's just a kid.

70
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't argue with him.

71
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,120
Yanxi,

72
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,160
don't be angry.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,920
How do you feel today?

74
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,120
Did you sleep well?

75
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,000
You slept well.

76
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,000
I bought you some fruits.

77
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,800
I have good news for you.

78
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,600
Niu Ben's workshop

79
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
was seized by the police.

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,519
Niu Ben and related personnel

81
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,439
were also taken away by the police.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,519
She's under investigation.

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,839
And the doctor said

84
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,560
you can leave the hospital tomorrow.

85
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,519
You solved it so quickly.

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,879
It's settled,

87
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,879
and you've recovered.

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Isn't it good?

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Okay.

90
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,040
Now that everything is settled,

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,639
let's pretend to work for our own benefit.

92
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,120
Stay here and play for two days.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,519
How can you think that way?

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
The fake factory

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,319
has been sealed up.

96
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,199
But the fake goods

97
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,120
that flow into the hands of customers,

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,519
We still have to recall it.

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,399
So we need to come up with a plan as soon as possible.

100
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,000
This is your fault.

101
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,279
Do you understand?

102
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,920
What is the combination of work and rest?

103
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
Why are you looking at me?

104
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,439
It's your fault.

105
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,399
You've been

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,279
living alone for a long time,

107
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,040
I don't know how to take care of myself.

108
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,120
I need to have a good talk

109
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,920
with Gu Qiao.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,879
Tell her to keep an eye on you.

111
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,000
I told you not to be so tired.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,079
And most importantly,

113
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,639
I'm not discharged from the hospital.

114
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,519
I'm still a patient.

115
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,639
Isn't the patient important?

116
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,720
Yes, yes, yes.

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Are you important?

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Didn't I buy you fruits?

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
It's good that you know.

120
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,879
You don't have to worry about it.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,120
I'll take care of the rest.

122
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,360
Arrange it.

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,519
Why are you still in the mood

124
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,800
to play games here?

125
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
So what?

126
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I don't care.

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Anyway, didn't I come to this company

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
for my brother?

129
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,600
Fine. It's my fault.

130
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,439
I don't care about this anymore.

131
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,120
No, no, no.

132
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Thank you just now.

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,720
You are much cuter

134
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,399
than Manager Zheng, Wang Mei

135
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,399
and Xia Meng.

136
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,000
Well,

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,279
you've been in the company for so long,

138
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,959
Why don't you

139
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,120
focus on your work?

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,240
I'd love to,

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,720
but they

142
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,040
don't give me any serious work,

143
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,519
Aren't you the same?

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
The newcomers are excluded

145
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,240
in the company,

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,319
Am I right?

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Yeah,

148
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,160
they know,

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,399
After my relationship with Yuan Ge,

150
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,600
he refused to let me do anything.

151
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
And this Wang Mei Xia Meng,

152
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,600
who speaks in a weird tone,

153
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,759
It's also against me.

154
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,800
It's okay.

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,839
Don't think too much.

156
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,040
You've done well.

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,319
I was supposed to comfort you,

158
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,959
but now it's the other way around,

159
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,519
All right, stop playing games.

160
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,279
Work hard.

161
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,120
It's not bad here.

162
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
It's quite comfortable.

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,919
This bottle of red wine

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,799
is the most precious one for me.

165
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,480
I personally carried it back

166
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,519
from Switzerland.

167
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,639
To prevent Hao Shuai from stealing it,

168
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,840
I changed the label.

169
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,679
He always thought it was a bottle of soy sauce,

170
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,600
so I brought it here.

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,639
I just thought that

172
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,080
after we solve

173
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
the fake case,

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
I drank it for the celebration,

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,519
but the doctor said I couldn't drink it,

176
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,799
I just took a cup

177
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,879
for you to drink.

178
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,720
Du Bingwen,

179
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,600
why did you bring a bottle of wine with you on a business trip?

180
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,679
Are you not pure-minded?

181
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,480
Pure

182
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,679
So pure.

183
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,039
It can't be more pure.

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,799
Be pure, okay?

185
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,960
Don't think too much.

186
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
Have a taste.

187
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it okay?

188
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,039
It's really nice.

189
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,440
You drink first.

190
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll pour it for you

191
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,000
after you drink it. It's all yours.

192
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,039
Who is it?

193
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,840
Who threw me away?

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
Strange.

195
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Could it be Ling Ling's

196
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,200
dad?

197
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,559
Can you guess

198
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,559
what Gu Qiao and I

199
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,759
drew?

200
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,240
Can't guess

201
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,039
what you drew?

202
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,559
Just take a guess.

203
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
Okay, Dad. Guess.

204
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,080
It's a picture

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,799
of a little pig,

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
No,

207
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,399
you're the one who's looking at the painting.

208
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,919
It's really good.

209
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
Dad,

210
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,159
Gu Qiao taught me to draw this.

211
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,159
Do you like it?

212
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
If you like it,

213
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,000
take it

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,679
as a gift from us.

215
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,000
-Okay. -Thank you, Miss Ling Ling

216
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,919
Valley.

217
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,360
I didn't expect you to be so good at drawing comics.

218
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,879
It's just a hobby I learned

219
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,840
when I was a kid.

220
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Xiong, you can eat now.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,519
Okay,

222
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Ling Ling, Gu Qiao

223
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,399
will stay for dinner with us today,

224
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,200
Are you happy?

225
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Kaixin,

226
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
it would be better if Gu Qiao

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,759
could stay at my house every day.

228
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Okay, let's eat.

229
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,360
Let's go.

230
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,919
You drank too fast.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
You have to take your time.

232
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,120
After that, I went back to China.

233
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,519
When I came back,

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,039
my friend introduced a headhunter,

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
He recommended

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,559
this company and that company to me,

237
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,120
This company and that company

238
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,159
are all very good.

239
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,639
But I told you I wouldn't go.

240
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,840
-I'm going. -Shumei keeps

241
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,679
persuading me,

242
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,799
What are you doing there?

243
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,039
What are you going to do?

244
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,120
I told you to stop.

245
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,679
I'll go to Shumei.

246
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,600
Fine, fine, fine,

247
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,120
and then Shumei will be here.

248
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,679
When I saw you in Shumei,

249
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,679
you were no different from

250
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,399
when I was a child.

251
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,159
I found no change at all.

252
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,960
I can't believe I feel like

253
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm back in school.

254
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,399
But soon I found out,

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
are you in love?

256
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
I couldn't accept it

257
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,759
at that time.

258
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,159
If you can't accept it,

259
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,279
you don't want to stay in Shanghai anymore.

260
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,240
Let's go somewhere else.

261
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,159
Where are you going?

262
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,519
Beijing,

263
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,720
To Shenzhen,

264
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,720
If I go to Guangzhou,

265
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,759
I don't want to stay in Shanghai anymore.

266
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,240
Then I thought,

267
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
no.

268
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,919
You can't give up so easily.

269
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
It seems that

270
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,279
your relationship with Zheng Jinnan

271
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,799
is not very stable.

272
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,879
To say the least,

273
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,879
what if Zheng Jinnan

274
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,840
is a liar?

275
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
Right?

276
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,399
What if it's really just

277
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,399
a decent name.

278
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,519
Actually, I have a question.

279
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,440
I've been wanting to ask you.

280
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,320
If we go back

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
to college,

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,039
Without those embarrassing things,

283
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,919
I'll pursue you seriously.

284
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,960
After a long time,

285
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
you can feel it,

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm serious.

287
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,960
I really like you.

288
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,320
Then,

289
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll confess my love to you.

290
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,080
Will you promise me?

291
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,759
That's my answer.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
Mr. Xiong, thank you.

293
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,960
Please send me back.

294
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,399
It's no trouble. It's my duty.

295
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,440
Besides, if you go home alone,

296
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,399
I don't feel at ease.

297
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,919
There's one thing

298
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,559
I'd like to ask you, okay?

299
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,399
Of course.

300
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
Just tell me.

301
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
It's not really a big deal,

302
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,639
Exactly

303
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,600
My leader

304
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,919
is my best friend.

305
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,759
So after I joined the company,

306
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,519
I didn't tell anyone,

307
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,399
I'm afraid people will

308
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,919
look at me with colored glasses.

309
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,480
But because of something,

310
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,440
they found out.

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,960
Since then,

312
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,240
their attitude towards me

313
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,360
has changed 180 degrees.

314
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,079
You won't let me do anything.

315
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
Even if I did something,

316
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,680
or did something wrong.

317
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,720
They don't say it on the surface,

318
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,160
but I know,

319
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,759
You must look down on me

320
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,359
behind my back.

321
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,240
Hold on.

322
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,960
Are you talking about your best friend?

323
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,640
It's your good friend.

324
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
It's her.

325
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,279
I also know that

326
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,720
it's normal to be like this in the workplace.

327
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
Am I being too melodramatic?

328
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,160
No.

329
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,279
My understanding,

330
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,279
in my opinion,

331
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,839
It's part of the job.

332
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,079
It's for living,

333
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,759
but what about the other part,

334
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,480
It's to show your personal value,

335
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
you know?

336
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,559
If we only get paid,

337
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,240
we won't get any promotion.

338
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,400
Or exercise opportunities.

339
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
That means you can't show

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,920
your personal value.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,759
Right?

342
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,200
Yes.

343
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,160
That's how I feel.

344
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,519
I feel like

345
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm redundant.

346
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
Don't think like that.

347
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,039
I think the root of your problem,

348
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,960
is that

349
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,839
your best friend is your leader,

350
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,160
So,

351
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,799
I suggest you,

352
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,960
We might as well consider changing departments,

353
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,200
changing leaders

354
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,440
and changing the relationship.

355
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,200
A lot of things

356
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,359
will change.

357
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,920
Another leader,

358
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,119
if you want to rely on your own skills,

359
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
If you have a foothold in the company,

360
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,319
you should find yourself a man

361
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,720
who is not inferior to your best friend,

362
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,759
At the same time,

363
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,960
I won't be afraid of

364
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,039
the power of your best friend,

365
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,359
I dare not use your leadership.

366
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,279
But only if

367
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,640
your relationship

368
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,880
can stand the test.

369
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,880
Our relationship,

370
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,680
of course, can't stand the test.

371
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,200
Mr. Xiong,

372
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,200
thank you.

373
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,240
I'll think about it.

374
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,720
You're welcome.

375
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Why did you leave first?

376
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,079
You didn't call me.

377
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,000
I came to the airport early.

378
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,960
Buy some local products

379
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,079
and bring them back to my colleagues.

380
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,079
You're a wounded man.

381
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,640
I want you to sleep a little longer.

382
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,559
Why are you not feeling well?

383
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,799
Yes

384
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,400
Big aunt,

385
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,079
I think so,

386
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,599
I need to go to the washroom.

387
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,240
Hold on.

388
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,720
I have experience with this.

389
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
Just in case,

390
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I'll go.

391
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,039
I'll check in first.

392
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,400
The ID card is in the jacket.

393
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,240
Gezi Bingwen,

394
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,279
you did a great job.

395
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,599
You really didn't disappoint me.

396
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,279
Especially you, Bingwen,

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
if the hospital says,

398
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,279
What tests do I need you to do?

399
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,359
You must go.

400
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,519
Don't leave any sequelae.

401
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,039
All the expenses

402
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,319
can be paid by the company.

403
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,079
-Thank you, Mr. Fu. -No, I'm

404
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,559
fine.

405
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,119
Look at Gong,

406
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,039
he really made me

407
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
betray my trust

408
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,359
in him,

409
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,880
You don't know,

410
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
if Shumei hadn't

411
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,759
given him a chance,

412
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,480
His factory closed down a long time ago.

413
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,119
I didn't expect this time,

414
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
because he didn't want to be responsible,

415
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,119
Concealing the truth on purpose,

416
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,960
Mr. Fu,

417
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,119
Mr. Gong

418
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,359
has resigned voluntarily.

419
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,519
I also looked for the factory.

420
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,559
Someone you trust will take over.

421
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,039
That's good.

422
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,519
However,

423
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,240
the fakes that are now

424
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,960
in the hands of the market and customers,

425
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,000
We should still recall it

426
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,319
in the name of the headquarters,

427
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,119
This is the plan that Mr. Du and I made.

428
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,000
Please have a look.

429
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,680
Let's not talk about whether it's true or not,

430
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:41,880
just say that some customers

431
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,839
are allergic to it,

432
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,119
We are willing to recycle it

433
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,359
at double price for research.

434
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,400
But in this way,

435
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,480
isn't it equivalent to telling everyone

436
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,759
that our Shumei products,

437
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,839
Is there a problem?

438
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:57,920
Mr. Fu,

439
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,079
actually,

440
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,240
A lot of big-name phones and cars,

441
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,480
because of quality problems,

442
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,640
If there is a large-scale recall,

443
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,160
after-sales service will be in place.

444
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Not only will it not cause the loss of customers,

445
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,880
but it will also enhance the brand trust.

446
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,240
How about this?

447
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,400
Let's not rush to do this first,

448
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,759
You just came back.

449
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
And Bingwen was injured.

450
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,759
It's better to wait for him to recover,

451
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,880
then make a decision.

452
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,160
Go back to your work.

453
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,319
I'll take my time.

454
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,640
Okay,

455
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
We'll get going then.

456
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,240
Mr. Fu doesn't seem

457
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
to want to recycle these fakes.

458
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,240
But from her point of view,

459
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,759
you can understand that

460
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
Manager Niu stole it himself.

461
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,039
Resulting in a serious decline

462
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,119
in sales in South China.

463
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,480
Shumei has already taken

464
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,559
such a big loss.

465
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
If we recall it on a large scale at this time,

466
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,240
the impact will be even greater.

467
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
But Shumei

468
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,599
is to blame for this.

469
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,279
We should be responsible to the end.

470
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,960
Yes.

471
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,160
Yes,

472
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,359
but not everyone

473
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,440
is like you.

474
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,279
There is a self-criticism in advance,

475
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,519
but if it is not so good,

476
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,480
it will be fine.

477
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,319
We don't want to.

478
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,440
Maybe Mr. Fu will figure it out in a couple of days.

479
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,599
You agreed to recall it again?

480
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,279
After work,

481
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,599
let's have a chat.

482
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,279
Let's eat something tonight.

483
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,240
How about another day?

484
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,839
Okay,

485
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,200
Then remember that

486
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,480
if Mr. Du is there tonight,

487
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,200
Mr. Yuan,

488
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,119
there's a document that needs your signature,

489
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,680
Okay,

490
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,079
Your HR department is so busy.

491
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,279
Why does it appear everywhere?

492
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,279
Mr. Du,

493
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,119
you seem to be everywhere.

494
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,680
I'm leaving.

495
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,839
What was I going to tell you?

496
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,920
Sister interrupted me

497
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,920
What was I going to say?

498
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,599
Why aren't you leaving?

499
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,359
What?

500
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,880
After hearing what you said,

501
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,759
you two.

502
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,799
You can even make a movie now.

503
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,799
I mean,

504
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,440
Du Bingwen is pretty good,

505
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,839
It's just such a kiss,

506
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,640
and you even

507
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,119
kissed your period.

508
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,880
Don't laugh.

509
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,720
Then your illness

510
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,799
is completely cured.

511
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,680
The disease has been cured,

512
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,000
but with Second Brother Du,

513
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,839
I haven't figured out how to deal with it yet?

514
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,039
Why?

515
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Is it because the company

516
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,559
doesn't allow office romance?

517
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,039
Zheng Jinnan and I went to the hospital

518
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,880
just because we were in a hurry.

519
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,079
But what about Second Brother Du?

520
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,240
I want to be serious.

521
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,400
But as you know,

522
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,480
he and I are the vice president of the company,

523
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,160
One is the brand director,

524
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,680
which is being watched

525
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,759
by the whole company.

526
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,960
Also,

527
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
do you think,

528
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,240
My relationship

529
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,039
with him

530
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,480
is moving too fast.

531
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,079
Hurry up.

532
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,160
When love comes, it can't be stopped.

533
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,039
Besides, you two know each other well,

534
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,000
and you two are classmates,

535
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,079
You're a colleague,

536
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,680
and you have an important position.

537
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,599
What a perfect match.

538
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,720
You've been single for too long,

539
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,680
and you're used to being alone,

540
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,119
I don't know how to fall in love,

541
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,759
how to welcome a relationship?

542
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,279
Maybe.

543
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
A pure girl

544
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,720
like you,

545
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't resist the arrival of love.

546
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Let love melt you slowly.

547
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,960
Besides,

548
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,640
you have an innate advantage,

549
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,400
What advantage?

550
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,480
If there's anything you don't understand,

551
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,400
you can ask Miss Gu.

552
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,759
Thank you, Miss Gu.

553
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,119
Isn't he good at it?

554
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,640
Why can't I go to

555
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
Second Brother Du's place?

556
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,200
It's a disease. It needs

557
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,279
to be cured.

558
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,079
I'm so worried.

559
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,640
That's great.

560
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,720
So the matter between you and your sister-in-law,

561
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,240
let's call it a deal.

562
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,160
Kind of.

563
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,839
at last

564
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,079
Really?

565
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,319
Do you want to give your sister-in-law to me

566
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,400
after you get it,

567
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,160
No, I won't.

568
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,519
I'm not that kind of person.

569
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,279
It's just that your sister-in-law is a bit strange. Maybe

570
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
when she comes back.

571
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,599
It's cloudy and sunny to me,

572
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,559
cold and hot,

573
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,039
In the office today,

574
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,400
when you deliberately avoided me

575
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
and Zhou Shan,

576
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,160
Totally different.

577
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't get it. I don't get it.

578
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Sister-in-law, you're drunk

579
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,519
and don't admit your debt,

580
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,000
Really?

581
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,119
Just kidding,

582
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,319
But

583
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,440
Sister-in-law,

584
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,480
are you being shy?

585
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,160
No, I won't.

586
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,640
From what I know about her,

587
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
she's not that kind of person at all.

588
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,000
Have you ever seen

589
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,559
your sister-in-law in a relationship?

590
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,559
That's right.

591
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,480
Women are all the same.

592
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,440
I'll buy you a drink, Gu Qiao.

593
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,160
Thank you.

594
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,440
Well

595
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,279
Hao Shuai, you're so childish.

596
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,880
Hao Shuai,

597
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,279
stop right there!

598
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,559
Jerk,

599
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,960
do you think I won't dare to chase you

600
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
after running into the Men's Toilet?

601
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,799
Is there such a joke?

602
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,720
What are you doing? Why are you drinking water

603
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,839
during working hours?

604
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,240
What are you thinking?

605
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,160
I just think the atmosphere is too dull.

606
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,039
I want to make fun of you. Is there

607
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
such a funny thing?

608
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
You're still smiling.

609
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,519
If you smile again,

610
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,319
Okay, okay.

611
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,480
I'm done smiling. I'm sorry.

612
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,839
I'm sorry.

613
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,079
I'm sorry.

614
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,640
Don't be mad.

615
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,440
Sis,

616
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,319
You look pretty when you're angry.

617
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,599
When am I not good-looking?

618
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,319
They all look good.

619
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Sis,

620
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,000
Our company

621
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
is so short of resources,

622
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
The ratio of male to female is seriously out of balance.

623
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,359
What do you think of me?

624
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,079
What do you mean?

625
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,000
Handsome?

626
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,359
Do you think you're handsome?

627
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,880
Narcissistic

628
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,759
and shy.

629
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,519
This incident

630
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
has taught us

631
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
a profound lesson,

632
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,119
So what?

633
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,839
All departments here,

634
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,039
especially the leaders of all departments,

635
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
I hope you must be

636
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
strict with yourselves,

637
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,680
You can't be selfish,

638
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,319
let alone greedy.

639
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
Where is Shumei?

640
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
It's a big family

641
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,599
and we have to stick together,

642
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,240
Only in this way can we create a new world

643
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,200
for our domestic products.

644
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,880
But of course,

645
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,039
this time

646
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,240
The way the whole incident was handled,

647
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
and the result,

648
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,200
Actually, I'm also very satisfied.

649
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,759
That's why I'm here

650
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,200
to give you a special compliment.

651
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,559
Our vice president,

652
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,960
Mr. Yuan,

653
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
And Mr. Du,

654
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,680
especially Mr. Du,

655
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,319
He was injured at work.

656
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,400
It's admirable.

657
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,400
Let's give him

658
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,559
a round of applause.

659
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,359
All right,

660
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,519
that's all I have to say.

661
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,480
For the next meeting,

662
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,359
I'll leave it to Mr. Yuan.

663
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,279
Mr. Fu,

664
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,759
I think

665
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,240
we should recycle it at a high price.

666
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,920
Counterfeit goods sold

667
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,079
from Zhoushan franchise store,

668
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,319
Then.

669
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,200
Let's discuss it together.

670
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,759
To express their opinions,

671
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,039
in fact, in addition to

672
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,480
the microorganism exceeding the standard,

673
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,839
All the ingredients and formulas

674
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,279
are the same as the authentic ones.

675
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,640
As long as we don't mention it,

676
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,119
outsiders won't be able to tell.

677
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
But now Miss Liu

678
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,079
has come to complain.

679
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,759
What if there's a second one?

680
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,680
The third one, Miss Liu,

681
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,119
is just an example.

682
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,240
To put it bluntly,

683
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,400
those who buy fakes,

684
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,200
It's also for the sake of petty gain.

685
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,359
Even if he knew

686
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,480
he had bought a fake.

687
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,039
He's too embarrassed to tell anyone.

688
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,359
But the problem is,

689
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,880
if we recycle it at a high price,

690
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,240
It proves that we have officially admitted

691
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,519
that there is a problem with the channel.

692
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,559
Aren't you

693
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,680
hitting yourself in the face?

694
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,440
We've solved the problem

695
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,720
from the source.

696
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,079
to give consumers and the market

697
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,680
an explanation,

698
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,400
Why did you hit yourself in the face?

699
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,079
Because consumers don't tell us,

700
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,799
we'll make them dumb

701
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,759
and eat Coptis chinensis.

702
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,400
This will definitely lead to

703
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
the loss of customers in the future,

704
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,960
I agree with Mr. Yuan's point of view,

705
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,480
but there is one problem,

706
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,759
At present,

707
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,720
many of these fakes

708
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,119
have reached the customers.

709
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,359
We don't have

710
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,559
a clear data,

711
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,599
If we rush to announce

712
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,839
a high price for recycling now,

713
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,559
I'm worried that if the amount is huge,

714
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,359
the cash flow of the company

715
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,240
will not be enough to support it,

716
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,039
which is also

717
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:30,960
a very real problem,

718
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,200
We have to figure out a way.

719
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,319
The later it is,

720
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,839
the more users will come into contact

721
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,680
with these fakes.

722
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,200
The worse it will be for us.

723
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,880
How about this?

724
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
Let's investigate first.

725
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,359
Make a detailed data,

726
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,759
make an estimate,

727
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,759
If we recycle it,

728
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,279
how much money do we need?

729
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,960
After the data comes out,

730
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,640
let's discuss and decide.

731
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,400
Let Zhang Wei

732
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,359
be in charge of this.

733
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,039
No problem.

734
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,960
Okay. Next.

735
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,079
Mr. Du,

736
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,039
do you have time

737
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,720
to join us for dinner?

738
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
You want me to treat you again.

739
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,640
No,

740
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,599
it's my treat today.

741
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,599
You're so generous

742
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,960
all of a sudden. There must be a conspiracy.

743
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,359
What conspiracy can I have?

744
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,759
Am I that kind of person?

745
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,960
I'm not here to see you two

746
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,279
make up and be happy for you two, am I?

747
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,599
Are you going or not?

748
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,319
Go,

749
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
I also have something to talk to you.

750
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,400
It's your treat then.

751
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,840
Got it. Let's go.

752
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,760
Let's go.

753
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,519
You said we were both like that,

754
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,760
and she came back and said she ignored me,

755
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,679
He just ignored me.

756
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,119
Why are all women like this?

757
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
What do you mean by that?

758
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,599
Let me tell you,

759
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,760
the boss paid you to come here,

760
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm not asking you two to fall in love.

761
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,119
Ge Ge is just

762
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,360
a business,

763
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,800
Not to mention you guys,

764
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,119
after our department found out about

765
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,440
my relationship with Ge Ge,

766
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,119
You won't let me do anything.

767
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm just a clerk,

768
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,639
how can I feel

769
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
what it's like to be overhead?

770
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,960
So do you think

771
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,480
I should transfer to another post?

772
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
The company can change jobs.

773
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,119
Yeah,

774
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,760
tell me,

775
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,760
You said Ge Ge is the vice president,

776
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,639
and this company,

777
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,360
Except for you and Mr. Fu,

778
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,679
no one will lose face to her.

779
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:10,920
Right?

780
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,079
It's about the same as

781
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,840
any department I go to, right?

782
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,119
You know what I mean.

783
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,800
What are you talking about?

784
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,320
I need an assistant here.

785
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,039
You can do it.

786
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,880
Do you think I can do it?

787
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,280
Why not?

788
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,599
Your ability to be an assistant is a waste of talent.

789
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,559
That's true,

790
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,559
but I have a condition,

791
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,480
You have to keep an eye on Yuan Ge for me.

792
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,840
Let her work and rest together,

793
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
don't just think about work,

794
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,599
Play when it's time.

795
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,440
Right?

796
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,079
Eat well and sleep well.

797
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,079
What's the point?

798
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,760
The point is, when it's time for you

799
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,239
to put in a good word and contribute,

800
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,280
You have to do these things,

801
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,079
you know?

802
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
-Got it. -Deal. Okay. Come

803
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,800
on.

804
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,719
Happy cooperation.

805
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,679
Thank you, boss.

806
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,360
This is what I should do.

807
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,280
Okay.

808
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,440
I'll take care of the assistant.

809
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,360
Okay.

810
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,519
Let's go.

811
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,360
You really won't pay the bill?

812
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,840
Without my phone,

813
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,840
why are you and I

814
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,079
so stingy?

815
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,480
I'm so poor and you're still squeezing me.

816
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
No wonder Ge Ge doesn't like you.

817
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,960
Gosh,

818
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,159
finish them all.

819
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,079
Hello,

820
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:48,840
Mr. Du. Hello, Mr. Du.

821
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,239
Didn't you tell me to drink less coffee?

822
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,480
Besides, I can't drink it for a few days.

823
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,239
I know.

824
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,199
It's just a cover-up.

825
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,480
Inside is the brown sugar water

826
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,760
I brewed specially for you,

827
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,719
Thank you.

828
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,800
Drink it while it's hot.

829
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,199
Do you have anything else to do?

830
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:29,719
Yes

831
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:30,840
What?

832
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,159
I sent you a message

833
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,039
last night. Why didn't you reply?

834
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,119
I went to bed early yesterday.

835
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,679
Nonsense!

836
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,079
You've been typing it.

837
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,000
No.

838
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,000
Forget it.

839
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,599
Send me a message later.

840
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
You can come back the next day.

841
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,920
Do you have anything else to do?

842
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,519
Yes,

843
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,119
Didn't I say

844
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,159
I need an assistant all the time?

845
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,199
There is a suitable candidate

846
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,159
right now.

847
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,920
Send your resume to Sister Wang,

848
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,400
and ask her to arrange an interview for you.

849
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,159
I'm talking about Gu Qiao,

850
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,320
Gu Qiao,

851
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,119
I've discussed it with her,

852
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,239
and she agreed to transfer her position.

853
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,239
You've talked to each other.

854
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:06,760
Yes.

855
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,119
Are you free tonight?

856
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,480
-Let's have dinner

857
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,199
together. -No.

858
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,400
Tonight,

859
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,159
I want to have a good talk with Gu Qiao.

860
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,639
You two can have a talk.

861
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm leaving now.

862
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,440
You want to go to Du Bingwen's place?

863
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,519
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

864
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,000
I see you have

865
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,679
a lot of business and personal affairs recently,

866
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,519
So I thought,

867
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,760
I won't trouble you.

868
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,159
It's not a big deal.

869
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,079
No matter how busy I am,

870
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,800
I won't delay talking about you.

871
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Ge Ge, I'm sorry.

872
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,639
It's my fault,

873
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,199
I think the transfer is a trivial matter,

874
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,280
so I don't need to care too much

875
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,719
about your business.

876
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,880
Is there anything I don't care about?

877
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,760
You told me,

878
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
Shu Mei would work hard when she joined the company.

879
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,000
But what about now?

880
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,800
You haven't even passed your internship.

881
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
I just want to transfer my post.

882
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,039
Yes, I understand.

883
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,320
Where's the marketing specialist?

884
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,719
Things are trivial,

885
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,760
so it will be hard.

886
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,639
But I also told you,

887
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,480
if you want to gain a foothold in the workplace,

888
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,280
You have to

889
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,840
work hard one step at a time,

890
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,159
Gu Qiao,

891
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,599
you can't just think about it,

892
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,320
He used his connections to take shortcuts.

893
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,280
Do you think

894
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,559
I didn't work hard at all?

895
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,360
I want to work hard too.

896
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,679
But ever since they found out

897
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,440
that I'm your best friend,

898
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,559
You won't let me do anything.

899
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,599
Ge Ge,

900
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,199
I'm not afraid of hard work.

901
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
I also want to make a career

902
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,079
on my own

903
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,400
step by step.

904
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,360
But tell me,

905
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,400
what should I do now?

906
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,920
I'm going to see Du Bingwen.

907
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Just because I know

908
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,440
he won't... Because I'm your best friend,

909
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
And you won't let me do anything.

910
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,320
Actually,

911
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,280
it's my fault.

912
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,039
I didn't

913
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,079
stand in your shoes before,

914
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,480
I thought about it.

915
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,519
Back in the karaoke room,

916
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,360
I saw that they were targeting you.

917
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,920
That's why

918
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,599
I only wanted to help you out.

919
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,400
Unexpectedly,

920
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,480
I actually helped you a lot.

921
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,800
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,320
Now that you're transferred to another post,

923
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,320
you can do it.

924
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,199
But let me remind you,

925
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,440
where are you at Du Bingwen's place?

926
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,159
Don't slack off.

927
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,920
Instead, I should work harder.

928
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,599
Because you're the only one who makes achievements,

929
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
no one in the company

930
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,280
will look down on you.

931
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,519
Got it?

932
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,159
Are you listening to me or not?

933
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,880
That's more like it.

934
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,519
Come on

935
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Have some lemonade.

936
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,320
No,

937
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,440
It's too sour.

938
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,400
It'll be more beautiful if you drink it.

939
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,760
Whitening,
