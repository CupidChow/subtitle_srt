1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,350
Hello,

2
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,790
are you Miss Gu?

3
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,120
Hello,

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,560
Hello,

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm Hu.

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,920
Hello,

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,840
What kind of house are you looking for?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
I'll live alone,

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,950
find a single room,

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,350
How much is your budget?

11
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,680
Budget,

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,350
I don't know the price around here,

13
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,950
Anyway, the lower the better.

14
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,070
The lower the better.

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,760
By the way,

16
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,150
a room was just vacant last night,

17
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,150
The price is quite cheap.

18
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,030
Let me show you.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,470
Okay. Thank you.

20
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,240
This way, please.

21
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,190
It's not too far.

22
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,310
We'll be there soon.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
Put your luggage in my car.

24
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay,

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,080
At first, Shumei wanted to

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,750
cooperate with a national cartoonist,

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,190
It's to promote the culture of the country,

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,190
not to admire Bai Xue's popularity,

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Now that

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,030
Bai Xue's works

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,150
are suspected of plagiarism,

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
Of course, Shumei hopes that

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
the sooner we get rid of each other, the better.

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,430
I hope Mr. Jia

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,520
can be with Shu Mei,

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,310
Let's unite.

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,150
Let's support originality together.

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,190
Carry forward the quintessence of Chinese culture.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,150
What do you mean?

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,520
We heard that

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,750
when Jia Lao was young,

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,280
He is a very famous

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,310
comic book artist in China,

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
What about our parents'generation?

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Everyone has seen Jia Lao's works,

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,430
but later, due to physical reasons,

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,750
Mr. Jia had to seal the pen.

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,000
More than ten years later,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
when he came back to the Jianghu,

50
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,680
The era of comic strips has passed.

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,190
Although we've been drawing these years,

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,360
But I have been suffering from

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,910
not having

54
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,030
a suitable platform for myself.

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,280
Use your own creation.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,840
Stop,

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
As for my grandfather's life,

58
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,710
I don't need you to tell me.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
That's the point.

60
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,120
Shumei

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
can provide such a platform

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
for your grandpa.

63
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,430
This is a cooperation agreement

64
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,240
that we drafted,

65
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,960
You can have a look.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,910
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

67
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,630
Our company

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,800
has two brands, Li Meng and Shu Mei,

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,910
Shu Mei is taking the people-friendly route,

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
with counters all over the country.

71
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,800
More than 200 million

72
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
users. Where's Li Meng?

73
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,430
It's a high-end route.

74
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
There are a lot of urban elites,

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,150
before we came here,

76
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,680
I did an online survey,

77
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,430
among the users of Li Meng,

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,630
30% of people

79
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,430
have the habit of going to art exhibitions

80
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,430
regularly.

81
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,400
If Mr. Jia is willing,

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
we are willing to cooperate with Mr. Jia,

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,080
Go to various provinces and cities from time to time

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,910
to carry out comic book

85
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,150
learning and exchange activities,

86
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,590
What do you think?

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,150
What about Bai Xue?

88
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,960
Legal affairs is already going through the process.

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,310
We will definitely terminate

90
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,190
our cooperation with her,

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,840
The peripheral products

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
we sold together

93
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,910
have also been stopped.

94
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,310
Okay,

95
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,870
This contract,

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
I'll take it back and study it slowly.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,600
Okay,

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,720
when did you finish your research?

99
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,830
When will you contact us?

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,870
I have one more condition.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,430
I know.

102
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,040
It takes a long time to follow the procedure.

103
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,390
So I want you

104
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,800
to make a statement in the official channel,

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,480
at once

106
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,560
To terminate the cooperation with Bai Xue,

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,390
here's the thing,

108
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,190
As for the plagiarism scandal,

109
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,920
there is no

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,830
official conclusion yet,

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
If before we decide

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,360
to work with Mr. Jia,

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,390
If you make

114
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,390
such a statement rashly,

115
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,390
Bai Xue's fans,

116
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,800
as well as our competitors,

117
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,830
You might take the opportunity to cause trouble.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
This is very irrational

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,070
for us.

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,950
Three days

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,270
later,

122
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,750
Can we work together or not?

123
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,190
I'll give you a letter of approval.

124
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,190
I hope you can prepare

125
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,480
that statement in advance.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
When this contract is fulfilled,

127
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,310
when you

128
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,310
make a statement,

129
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,390
Isn't that fair?

130
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,830
No problem.

131
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,560
By the way, Mr. Jia,

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
I have one more request,

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,070
I wonder if I can

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,070
meet your grandpa.

135
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,360
I want to apologize to him face to face.

136
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,160
No need.

137
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,360
My grandpa just got out of the hospital,

138
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
a lot of things,

139
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,120
I haven't told him yet.

140
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,390
Slow down a little bit.

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll wait for your news.

142
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
Judging from Jia Long's appearance,

143
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,160
he must have

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
let go of his bad feelings towards us.

145
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,800
In this collaboration,

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
there should be no problem.

147
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,480
You're still worried that Gu Qiao

148
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,630
wants to see

149
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,950
Grandpa Jia Long as soon as possible.

150
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
Find out

151
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,830
the whole story.

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,070
Gu Qiao can come back earlier.

153
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,920
Mr. Yuan and Mr. Du,

154
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,950
let's have lunch together,

155
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,480
There are some details about Jia Long,

156
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
I need to reconfirm it with you.

157
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,070
Okay,

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,310
Go and draft the statement first,

159
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll report to Mr. Fu later

160
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,070
and see

161
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
Gu Qiao has left.

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,270
They seem to be fine.

163
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,800
It seems that the related family can't do it either.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
In Shanghai,

165
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
you still have to look at your real skills.

166
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,560
but

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I think Gu Qiao is quite wronged.

168
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,800
Even if Bai Xue did plagiarize it,

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,310
who would know?

170
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,310
Mr. Fu,

171
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,560
Jia Long said,

172
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,870
As long as we issue a statement,

173
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,600
and terminate the cooperation with Bai Xue's company,

174
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,430
He will consider cooperating with us.

175
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,000
This idea of making amends for one's merits

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,870
is correct.

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
At least our Shu Mei

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,430
won't give away the money

179
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,630
that the people actually gave to the picturesque country?

180
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,390
Eighty percent

181
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,070
It's hard to get it back.

182
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,870
If we

183
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,160
work with Jia Long again,

184
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,630
Isn't it going to cost a lot of money again?

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr. Fu,

186
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
we can only try our best

187
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,870
to minimize the loss.

188
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,160
If I spend money,

189
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,750
I can protect Shumei's reputation.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,920
If you spend a little more,

191
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,870
it's worth it.

192
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,040
I understand that.

193
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
During this period of time,

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,560
I just thought,

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
There are not so many things in the company.

196
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
I'm going to check on Baona.

197
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,270
We can talk about business as well.

198
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,510
I didn't expect that

199
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,160
the front foot just left,

200
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,950
Something happened to the back foot.

201
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,830
Mr. Fu,

202
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,390
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,720
I heard from them,

204
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,680
did you fire Gu Qiao?

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,600
Sorry to trouble you.

206
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,790
I know you very well.

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Gu Qiao

208
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
will blame you this time, right?

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,120
Mr. Fu,

210
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,750
actually,

211
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,390
What's wrong?

212
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,750
Nothing.

213
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,510
Let's talk about it when things are settled.

214
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,630
Ge Zi, do you remember

215
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,390
the two of us?

216
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,750
I've seen all kinds of winds and waves.

217
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,910
ten million

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,150
Don't capsize in the gutter.

219
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,270
Don't worry,

220
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,750
I know what to do.

221
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,480
Miss Gu, this way, please.

222
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,150
This is our two bedrooms and one living room,

223
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,440
and this side is the open kitchen,

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,550
All the kitchen utensils are new.

225
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
This is the bathroom.

226
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
Fine decoration. Dry-wet separation.

227
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay. This way, please.

228
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,030
This is our living room.

229
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
Look at this French window,

230
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,550
The ventilation and lighting

231
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,440
are very good.

232
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,480
All the furniture

233
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,390
is newly configured,

234
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,670
This curtain

235
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,600
is also arranged

236
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
according to the color of the furniture,

237
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,840
okay?

238
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,670
This way, please.

239
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,480
This is our second bedroom.

240
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Someone's sharing it with you,

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
and we're looking at the back master bedroom,

242
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,910
Please come in.

243
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,080
This master bedroom,

244
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
its ventilation and lighting,

245
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,120
As well as the decoration,

246
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
they are all very sophisticated.

247
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,910
There's also a separate bathroom.

248
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,790
What do you think?

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,960
How do you feel?

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
This one is good.

251
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,200
This one,

252
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,320
How much is it?

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
3, 800 yuan a month.

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,030
One pays three.

255
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,910
And one month's agency fee,

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
how much is it?

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,510
It's 19thousand.

258
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,600
It's so expensive.

259
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,240
Of course.

260
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
There are so many office buildings around here,

261
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,510
Of course, house prices are rising.

262
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,750
Is there an environment?

263
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,030
Something like this.

264
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
But the cheaper

265
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,670
Miss Gu,

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
According to your request,

267
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,600
this is the cheapest house

268
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,910
around here.

269
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,910
Do you really

270
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,750
work around here?

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,510
Kind of.

272
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,910
If that's the case,

273
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,480
consider commuting time,

274
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,150
Then go along the subway

275
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,960
and look for it.

276
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,270
The price is not

277
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,510
much cheaper than here.

278
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,790
But it's more cost-effective.

279
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
If you don't think about

280
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,150
commuting time,

281
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,550
Then live a little farther away.

282
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,120
The price is half that here.

283
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,870
Then.

284
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
I'll think about it.

285
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,670
Thank you.

286
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,030
Please

287
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,670
Hello, Mr. Du.

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
Did you forget that

289
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,510
I was fired?

290
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,390
How can you say that?

291
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,150
Did you not eat?

292
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm hungry.

293
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,870
Tell me. What is it?

294
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,030
I'll treat you to dinner.

295
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,150
I've sent you the address.

296
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm not going.

297
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
You must put in a good word for her.

298
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,750
We went to see Jia Long this morning.

299
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you want to know the follow-up?

300
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,390
Let's meet

301
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,200
and talk. See you later.

302
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,790
Mr. Yuan,

303
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,320
I was thinking,

304
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you want Gu Qiao

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,870
to resign on his own,

306
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,510
If your resume says you are fired,

307
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,440
it will be hard to find a job in the future.

308
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,390
Sister,

309
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,000
Gu Qiao is not in a hurry,

310
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,390
Her work station is empty.

311
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,240
Don't clean it up.

312
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Okay.

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,030
I made an appointment for you

314
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,390
to have dinner with Gu Qiao,

315
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,150
Come on!

316
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey,

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Du Bingwen,

318
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,550
are you sure Gu Qiao will come?

319
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,150
Of course,

320
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,080
because I didn't tell her at all.

321
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,000
I want to see you.

322
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,720
Well,

323
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,320
Don't worry.

324
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,550
She will definitely come.

325
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,320
Hello,

326
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,550
Mr. Du's reservation

327
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,600
is in there.

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
Table 8!

329
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,870
Okay,

330
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,630
Well,

331
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,480
Can I deposit

332
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
this box here?

333
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
Okay, no problem.

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Thank you.

335
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,390
I'll leave it here.

336
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,120
Okay, okay.

337
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,080
Gu Qiao,

338
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,870
you're here.

339
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Why are you here?

340
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,360
Sit down.

341
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,790
I'll explain it to you later.

342
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,550
Where's Du Bingwen?

343
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,200
He,

344
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,120
Don't go.

345
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,750
I ordered a table of your favorite dishes.

346
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,910
You can leave after eating.

347
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

348
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,720
Gu Qiao,

349
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,960
I don't know if Du Bingwen

350
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
told you,

351
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,150
When Jia Long

352
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
came to see us,

353
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,390
He said his grandfather

354
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,840
came to the company to look for you,

355
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,840
I told you about plagiarism,

356
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,750
Tell me

357
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,550
Promise him that he'll give feedback to his superiors.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
But I didn't.

359
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,600
That's why his grandfather was hospitalized.

360
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,320
So you believe it?

361
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
I won't believe it.

362
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,790
But it was an emergency

363
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,150
and Jia Long insisted,

364
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,030
If he doesn't fire you,

365
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,270
he will continue to broadcast live.

366
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,360
I had to

367
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,790
deal with Jia Long first,

368
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,790
I will find out the truth,

369
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,030
when I find out the truth.

370
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,550
I told Mr. Fu to let you come back,

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
but you still don't believe me.

372
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,720
Fire me first,

373
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,870
then find out the truth,

374
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,960
You're just scared.

375
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,150
Grandpa Jia Long is telling the truth.

376
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,870
I don't think so.

377
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,480
Ge Ge,

378
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,120
sometimes,

379
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,030
I know you better than you do.

380
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you think so?

381
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,600
I know very well.

382
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,640
Hey,

383
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,350
Qiao Qiao,

384
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,240
Mom,

385
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,350
Have you eaten?

386
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm eating.

387
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,400
What's wrong?

388
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,350
Nothing important.

389
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,920
This morning,

390
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,550
your dad woke up and told me,

391
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,750
He dreamed about you yesterday.

392
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm thinking,

393
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,110
your father must miss you.

394
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,400
See if you can spare some time

395
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,310
these days and come back.

396
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,960
I've been quite busy lately.

397
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,590
All right,

398
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,480
go ahead with your work.

399
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
I must be busy with your work.

400
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,070
Is Yuan Ge okay?

401
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,480
It's good.

402
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,400
Qiao Qiao,

403
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,830
what about you now?

404
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,440
Living in Yuan Ge's house,

405
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,880
if you really have a living mother in your eyes,

406
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,830
I still have work to do.

407
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll get back to work.

408
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
-I won't talk to you. -Goodbye. Hello, Wang

409
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,400
Mei. I'm Gu Qiao.

410
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,750
You have to understand Gu Qiao.

411
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,030
Where is she?

412
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,200
I want to live with you

413
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,920
on an equal footing.

414
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,070
Instead of being taken care of by you for a long time.

415
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,830
After such a long time,

416
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,720
no one will feel bad.

417
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,400
Am I right?

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
I've gone too far

419
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
this time.

420
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,000
No

421
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,830
Why are you standing in your shoes?

422
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
You didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,310
Really?

424
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,160
Du,

425
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,400
I want to ask you something,

426
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,030
You mean,

427
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,720
you're Gu Qiao's leader?

428
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Why did you send her, a girl,

429
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
to such a far place alone,

430
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm on a business trip.

431
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,200
Isn't the company short of manpower?

432
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Next time,

433
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,110
the next time the company recruits a new company,

434
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,590
I'll definitely send her an assistant.

435
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Let's do it this time.

436
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,680
But why does she like Chengdu so much?

437
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,510
Just let her stay in Chengdu

438
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,790
for a while,

439
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
What?

440
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,680
Where do you think it is?

441
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,720
Cheng Chengcheng.

442
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,270
Yuan Ge,

443
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,070
you mean Guangzhou?

444
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,960
She said it's Beijing,

445
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,480
and here comes another Chengdu,

446
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
Where did Gu Qiao

447
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,030
go on a business trip?

448
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,480
The thing is,

449
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,750
she's going to Beijing first,

450
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,350
Then to Guangzhou,

451
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,350
and finally to Chengdu.

452
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
What about our company?

453
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,960
In the whole country,

454
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
there are many stores,

455
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,000
Why did you go to Chengdu in the end?

456
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,680
It's because she likes Chengdu very much.

457
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
She wants to spend some time in Chengdu,

458
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,440
so when she finishes her work,

459
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,750
Stay in Chengdu for a while

460
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,550
and then come back.

461
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,000
Well,

462
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,480
your company is really thoughtful.

463
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,960
I missed three places in one trip,

464
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,270
which makes me a little confused.

465
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,510
Thank you.

466
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,550
Enjoy your meal.

467
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,640
Come on.

468
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,720
Eat more.

469
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,200
You've lost weight recently.

470
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,880
Thank you.

471
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,720
You're welcome.

472
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,270
After all, we used to work together,

473
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,640
and when you called me

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,480
just now,

475
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,110
I thought

476
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,350
your friend wanted to rent it,

477
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,960
Here's the thing.

478
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Yuan Ge's dad is here.

479
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,350
I've been living there.

480
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
It doesn't fit either.

481
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,110
Then.

482
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you and Mr. Yuan

483
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,000
all right?

484
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,310
It's okay. We're fine.

485
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Although we are best friends,

486
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,070
things are the same.

487
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,790
All right, let's not talk about her.

488
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,880
What do you

489
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
think of my roommate?

490
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
My old roommate

491
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,550
went back to his hometown and got married.

492
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,590
He left in a hurry.

493
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,480
I was thinking,

494
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,590
isn't it a waste of one day's rent

495
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,350
if this house is empty one more day?

496
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:22,960
Yes.

497
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,790
I do want to

498
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,880
find a roommate to share it with,

499
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,510
But to be honest, Gu Qiao,

500
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm afraid you won't get used to it.

501
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,960
How could it be?

502
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
I'll show you around later.

503
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,590
You'll see.

504
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,030
No need.

505
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,480
I'll settle it with you now.

506
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,590
Well,

507
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,350
Do you want a short rent or a long rent?

508
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,750
I think he'll stay for a long time, right?

509
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't worry,

510
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,070
if I move out,

511
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,550
I'll give you enough time.

512
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,030
So that you can find a suitable roommate.

513
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,510
That's good.

514
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,030
One for three, I should be

515
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,720
5. 2 thousand,

516
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,510
Okay.

517
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,830
Take it.

518
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

519
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,440
From now on,

520
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
we'll be roommates,

521
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,750
Please take care of me.

522
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,830
Don't say that.

523
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,000
Me,

524
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,440
Actually, I was

525
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
embarrassed before.

526
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,590
It's okay.

527
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,480
I just want to get along with you.

528
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,510
I think you're actually

529
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,830
quite nice.

530
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,350
You have a good taste.

531
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,270
Come on, let's have a drink.

532
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,510
Watch out!

533
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,960
Here we are.

534
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,720
This one.

535
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,720
You've never lived in

536
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,830
such an old house, have you?

537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,750
I'm not that delicate.

538
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,350
I suffered a lot when I was a kid.

539
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,590
I'm relieved to hear that.

540
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,110
Thank you.

541
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,440
This house looks old,

542
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,920
but the first floor is very convenient.

543
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,270
Come on.

544
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
Lower your voice.

545
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,400
They're all asleep now.

546
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,510
Let me introduce this one to you

547
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,960
briefly. What about this one?

548
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
We usually dry clothes

549
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
and put sundries in the air.

550
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,960
This is the kitchen,

551
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,270
but,

552
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,110
The standard of eating

553
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,590
is different. If everyone cooks,

554
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,270
It's hard to figure out the water,

555
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,440
electricity and gas charges.

556
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,310
Besides,

557
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,350
it's not easy to clean this place.

558
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,400
So no one cooks.

559
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,680
Usually try to order takeout,

560
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,030
its biggest function at present

561
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,920
is storage,

562
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,920
And here.

563
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,110
This is the bathroom.

564
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,440
But now there are people

565
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
in this room,

566
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
Plus you now,

567
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,110
there are five people in total,

568
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,070
Except that the room

569
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,750
works from home,

570
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,590
Everyone else leaves early and returns late.

571
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,240
By the way,

572
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,920
Every morning from 6: 00 to 8: 00, from 8:

573
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,720
00 to 10: 00,

574
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,270
It's rush hour,

575
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,440
so be sure to stagger it.

576
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,110
If you're in a hurry,

577
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,830
you can also go to the public toilet outside,

578
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,790
also

579
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,160
Your shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste,

580
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,400
toothbrush and so on,

581
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,310
Don't put it in there.

582
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,510
When you use it,

583
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,750
just take it in.

584
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,960
You must have talked a lot.

585
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I think you should take a memo

586
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,550
and write it down later.

587
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,270
Let me show you around the room.

588
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:46,880
Okay,

589
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,440
Let's go.

590
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,440
Come on.

591
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,070
Excuse me!

592
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,880
I'll help you! I'll help

593
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,590
you! There! There!

594
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,550
Just put it there.

595
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
It's a little messy.

596
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,550
It's different from the picture.

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,110
My roommate just left,

598
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,550
I haven't had time to clean up yet.

599
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,720
How about

600
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,350
we make do with it today.

601
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,200
After the weekend,

602
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,350
I'll clean it up.

603
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,160
It's okay,

604
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,750
but this house is so big,

605
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,030
No matter how you clean it up,

606
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,440
you can't compare with

607
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,640
Mr. Yuan's high-class residence,

608
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,030
No, I won't.

609
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,440
Which side do you usually sleep on?

610
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,510
I can sleep anywhere.

611
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,750
Then I'll sleep here.

612
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm used to sleeping.

613
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,960
Okay,

614
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,830
The housing price in Shanghai is like this.

615
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,790
What if you want to save money?

616
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,240
You have to live far away.

617
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,550
But it doesn't matter. We

618
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,110
come back from work every day,

619
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,270
You're as tired as a dog.

620
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,070
I don't want to do anything

621
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,240
but sleep.

622
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,480
And this wardrobe,

623
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,240
let's take half for each of us.

624
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,270
But I guess you must have

625
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,310
a lot of clothes.

626
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,510
You can buy

627
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,000
another convenient wardrobe online,

628
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,830
It's cheap.

629
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
I need to go to the bathroom.

630
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,510
Go ahead.

631
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,070
What do you think?

632
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,200
It's good.

633
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,000
That's fine.

634
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,550
By the way, your phone rang just now,

635
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,400
I think it was Mr. Yuan.

636
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Then.

637
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,550
What's your next plan?

638
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,350
I don't know either.

639
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,000
Actually, regarding this matter,

640
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,590
I've always felt that you're quite upset.

641
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,270
Xia Meng said

642
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,680
about plagiarism,

643
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,550
Maybe someone framed her up

644
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,880
on purpose. Why?

645
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,480
She said,

646
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,880
Bai Xue is very popular in the border of the country,

647
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,790
It blocked a lot of people's money.

648
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,750
Dad, go to bed early.

649
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,480
You just got out of the hospital.

650
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,240
You can't be like me.

651
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
You think you can handle it

652
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,880
when you're young.

653
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,200
Don't blame me for nagging,

654
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,790
I know what you've been doing on your own

655
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,590
since you were a child,

656
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,750
I know what to do.

657
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,350
But it's too strong.

658
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,720
It may not be a good thing.

659
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
You have to know

660
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,240
how to take a step back and make it easier,

661
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,030
Especially in front of people close to you,

662
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,590
what's the problem?

663
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,030
So I spread it out and talked about it.

664
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,400
Don't keep it to yourself.

665
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,790
Dad, I got it.

666
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,750
Send Gu Qiao

667
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,510
a text message when you have time,

668
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,350
Is it going well?

669
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,510
If she finishes her work,

670
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,880
tell her to come back early. "

671
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:36,960
Eat,

672
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
Hello,

673
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm fine.

674
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,590
Wang Mei,

675
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,880
how much longer do you need?

676
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,110
I'm almost there.

677
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,790
I'm almost there.

678
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,440
I'll put some sauce on you. Wang

679
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,480
has a new roommate,

680
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,750
Hello, my name is Gu Qiao.

681
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,240
Hello,

682
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,640
Wang used to have a roommate,

683
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,270
who was good everywhere.

684
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,750
I just don't like cleanliness.

685
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,790
I think you like to be clean.

686
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,590
As for sharing,

687
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,750
the most important thing

688
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,790
is to be clean.

689
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,790
Right, honey?

690
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,240
Yes.

691
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,110
Wife,

692
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,240
Wang's roommate,

693
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,030
When did you move out?

694
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,270
Why didn't I know?

695
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,200
What?

696
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,310
I can't bear to part with him.

697
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Isn't there WeChat in WeChat group?

698
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,830
See for yourself.

699
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,110
What are you talking about?

700
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,350
I only have eyes for you.

701
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,030
All right. What show

702
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,920
is this early in the morning?

703
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
I've never heard of it.

704
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,030
Soo-eun loves to die so fast.

705
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,640
Why are you

706
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,350
so bad-mouthed?

707
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,440
I didn't give you

708
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,270
a present yesterday.

709
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,830
All right, honey.

710
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,030
Hurry up and eat. I'm late.

711
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,070
Can you hurry up?

712
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
I dropped it.

713
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,200
Do you know how to speak?

714
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,550
First come,

715
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,350
first served. Gu Qiao, you go first.

716
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,110
Hurry up, honey.

717
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,550
Whether you can go or not,

718
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll go if you don't

719
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,750
get off work tonight.

720
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,590
Remember to pick me up

721
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,310
and dawdle,

722
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,550
Look at her.

723
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,000
She's always bullying people.

724
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,160
Miss Gu Qiao,

725
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,960
can you

726
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,920
pull this for me.

727
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,510
Okay.

728
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,200
I can't reach it.

729
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,350
Why did you get up so early today?

730
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,310
There's an interview.

731
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,160
No.

732
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,310
I'll go find Bai Xue.

733
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,640
There you go again.

734
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,510
We've been here for a few days.

735
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,440
I didn't even see

736
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,240
anyone here.

737
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,070
Here comes a tough one.

738
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,680
Hey,

739
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,590
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

740
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,110
Are you free today?

741
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,200
My grandpa wants to talk to you face to face.

742
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,680
Okay, I'll be right there.

743
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,960
Come in,

744
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,790
Mr. Xiong,

745
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,640
there's something,

746
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,510
I think I should

747
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,400
report it to you,

748
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,590
Shumei's matchmaker has changed.

749
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,750
Why?

750
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
I heard it's because Gu Qiao is in charge of

751
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,440
the joint cooperation project between China and Manchuria,

752
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,750
Because he was suspected of plagiarism,

753
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,920
he had a lot of negative effects

754
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
on the company,

755
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,590
So she was fired.

756
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,510
I don't think

757
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,880
it's entirely Gu Qiao's fault,

758
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,230
Maybe there's

759
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,280
something inside?

760
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,070
Okay, I got it.

761
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,590
Slow down, Grandpa.

762
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Be careful.

763
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,840
Grandpa,

764
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,760
this is Shumei's vice president,

765
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,440
He can speak for the company,

766
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,760
the employee who lied to you last time,

767
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,710
She was the one who fired him.

768
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,360
Hello.

769
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,030
Hello,

770
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,030
Mr. Jia. Have a seat.

771
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,960
Thank you.

772
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,150
Have a seat, too.

773
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,880
Be careful.

774
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,000
Come on.

775
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,150
Mr. Jia,

776
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,550
I'm the vice president of Shu Mei Company,

777
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,190
Yuan Ge,

778
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm so sorry.

779
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,480
Last time,

780
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,630
we were careless about our work.

781
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,480
I've caused you

782
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,550
so much trouble,

783
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,190
It's okay.

784
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,280
Listen to Xiaolong,

785
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,840
you guys

786
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,710
You want to buy my painting?

787
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,320
Yes,

788
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,630
What we want to buy is the right to use,

789
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,760
as long as you are willing to authorize it,

790
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,510
Then we can print your paintings

791
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,920
on our products.

792
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Sell it,

793
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,150
follow up our company,

794
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,110
There are also some

795
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,030
offline promotion activities,

796
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,400
How about this

797
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,880
It will make your works of art,

798
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,190
in the hearts of the public,

799
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,510
It's more well-known and recognized.

800
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,800
Ming and Li.

801
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,030
At my age,

802
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,880
I don't care anymore.

803
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,190
The problem is my work,

804
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,000
that's my work.

805
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,150
No one else can steal it.

806
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,920
This is the principle.

807
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,800
It's also the minimum respect

808
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
for art.

809
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,440
I see, Mr. Jia,

810
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,960
Then.

811
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,840
Have you

812
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,150
read the contract?

813
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,480
I don't care about the contract,

814
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,670
you talk to Xiaolong,

815
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,510
I got it.

816
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,840
As for the details,

817
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,190
I'll talk to Mr. Jia.

818
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,030
By the way, Mr. Jia,

819
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,320
I heard

820
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,400
from Mr. Jia before,

821
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,760
You came to our company once.

822
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,670
It reflected the problem of plagiarism.

823
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,110
An employee

824
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,190
named Gu Qiao

825
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,030
received you that day.

826
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,840
Right?

827
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,670
Yes.

828
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
The one you fired.

829
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,320
As a leader,

830
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,800
you're quite reliable.

831
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,360
Pay attention to restrain

832
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,510
your employees,

833
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,000
You can't do this.

834
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,550
If it goes on like this for a long time,

835
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
something will happen.

836
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,840
Thank you for reminding me.

837
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,030
Can you do me a favor?

838
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,230
Excuse me,

839
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,480
can you identify Gu Qiao

840
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,190
in this photo?

841
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,550
Mr. Yuan,

842
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
it's okay. What do you mean?

843
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,070
It's okay.

844
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Don't get me wrong,

845
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm not questioning Mr. Jia.

846
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,070
I just want to confirm it.

847
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,030
It's her.

848
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,710
Are you sure it's her?

849
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,630
That's her. That's right.

850
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
Mr. Jia,

851
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,030
would you mind telling me

852
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,670
what happened that day?

853
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,550
Hello,

854
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,360
young man,

855
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,000
Open the door for me.

856
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,280
Do you have an appointment?

857
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,550
Appointment?

858
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,590
I don't have an appointment.

859
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,440
If you don't have an appointment,

860
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
I can't let you in.

861
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,230
I'm looking for Shumei Company,

862
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,590
I have something important to talk about.

863
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,670
Excuse me,

864
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,630
sir.

865
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,960
According to our company's rules,

866
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,000
outsiders

867
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,230
must be received by the company.

868
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,800
To get in.

869
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,840
How about this?

870
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,630
Call Shumei's people

871
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,480
and ask them to send someone to pick you up.

872
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,110
Okay,

873
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,710
Give me the number of their leader.

874
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,190
I called him,

875
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,550
the leader,

876
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,550
How can I give it to you?

877
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,190
He leaked personal information of others,

878
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,630
a cartoonist

879
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,190
who works with Shumei Company.

880
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,150
You plagiarized my work.

881
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,070
I'm looking for them.

882
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,360
It's really important.

883
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,280
Where do you want to talk about it?

884
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,550
Sir,

885
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
this has nothing to do with me.

886
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,800
We have a rule here.

887
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,550
You don't have an appointment?

888
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,840
I can only follow the rules.

889
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,030
He refused to give me the phone.

890
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,190
You won't let me in.

891
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay,

892
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,190
I'll wait here.

893
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,230
Sir,

894
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,670
is this the gate?

895
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,920
Shall we go there?

896
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,880
Sir,

897
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,280
it's my first day at work.

898
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,630
Don't give me a hard time. Why are you here?

899
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,510
Are you catching a thief?

900
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,960
Don't do it!

901
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,960
Hello, uncle.

902
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,590
I'm Shumei's employee.

903
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,150
You can tell me if you need anything.

904
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,880
You're Shu Mei's employee.

905
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,190
That's great.

906
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,070
Take me upstairs.

907
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,230
I'm looking for your leader.

908
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,400
Our leader is not in the company today,

909
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,510
What else

910
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,510
can I do for you?

911
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,440
You can tell me first,

912
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,400
and I'll relay it for you when the leader comes back.

913
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,400
How about this?

914
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,510
Let's talk here.

915
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,320
Come on,

916
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,030
All right, calm down.

917
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,110
Don't argue with him.

918
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Let's come over here.

919
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,280
Have a seat

920
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,320
Okay,

921
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,400
Come on

922
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,590
Even a small security guard

923
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,440
dares to yell at me.

924
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,110
Take your time.

925
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,550
Don't get angry and ruin yourself.

926
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,480
How can I not be angry?

927
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,110
I was kind enough to remind you,

928
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,480
but you didn't let me in.

929
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,710
deserve it

930
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Your company

931
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,070
is waiting to be implicated.

932
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

933
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,280
So what do you want to

934
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,320
give us feedback today?

935
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,440
Well,

936
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,000
didn't your company

937
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,030
cooperate with

938
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,070
a cartoonist named Bai Xue recently?

939
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,000
All of her stuff

940
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,840
was copied from me.

941
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,710
This is blasphemy against art.

942
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,960
You said Bai Xue plagiarized your work,

943
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,110
I have proof.

944
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,440
Look.

945
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,960
Uncle,

946
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,150
Bai Xue's overall style

947
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,630
is partial to two-dimensional.

948
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,230
It seems to be

949
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,550
a little far from yours.

950
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
Look carefully,

951
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,960
her whole story idea,

952
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,070
The basic elements of each unit

953
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,550
are exactly the same as mine.

954
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,710
Well,

955
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,030
It's true.

956
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,880
It's my comic book.

957
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,840
Back in the 70 s and 80 s,

958
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,670
it became a household name.

959
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,480
I can't

960
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,960
slander a young painter.

961
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,550
Besides,

962
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm here today,

963
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,230
I'm not here to hold you accountable.

964
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,190
Where's my grandson?

965
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,710
For infringement,

966
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,070
plagiarism,

967
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,000
He insisted on defending my rights.

968
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,070
I'm afraid,

969
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,230
your company

970
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,150
will be implicated.

971
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,190
So today, I'm here to remind you,

972
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,320
you'd better

973
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
terminate the partnership with her as soon as possible.

974
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,710
Uncle,

975
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,840
Here's the thing, uncle.

976
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,110
Actually, I am.

977
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Me

978
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,920
In fact,

979
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,440
he's the person in charge of this project,

980
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,440
Yes.

981
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,670
Thank you so much

982
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,800
for coming all the way here today

983
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
to tell us this,

984
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,960
Well,

985
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,150
wait for our leader to come back.

986
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,150
I'll tell them about it

987
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,670
as soon as possible.

988
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,960
It has attracted the attention of the whole company.

989
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,960
If Bai Xue's plagiarism

990
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,630
is true,

991
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,030
We immediately cut off

992
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,110
all cooperation with her,

993
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,550
So you're the person in charge

994
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,550
of this project,

995
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,190
I haven't asked yet.

996
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,030
Miss, what's your surname?

997
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,190
No matter your surname is Gu,

998
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,030
just call me Gu Qiao.

999
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,400
Gu Qiao,

1000
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,030
how about this Uncle,

1001
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,670
Why don't we

1002
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,360
leave a contact number,

1003
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,280
Any news?

1004
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,110
I'll talk to you at any time.

1005
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,000
Fine, fine,

1006
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,440
Come on,

1007
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,360
Come on.

1008
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,360
Here you are.

1009
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,590
Okay,
