1
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,599
Cousin,

2
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
oh my god,

3
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,439
Who do I think I am?

4
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,000
When did you come back?

5
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
Come on. Why didn't you tell me

6
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,479
in advance? Daodao.

7
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,560
I came back as soon as I got off the plane.

8
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,599
Did you have a holiday?

9
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,759
Me,

10
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,120
When I came back for my internship,

11
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,439
why didn't I go back to your parents'home first?

12
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,759
My parents said

13
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,919
they wanted me to stay abroad.

14
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,240
If you continue your internship,

15
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,039
I think it's better to stay in China.

16
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,719
So I came back.

17
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaking of which,

18
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
can you let me

19
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
stay with you for a few more days?

20
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,319
Please.

21
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,759
Why did you drink my wine?

22
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
What's wrong?

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,520
Why is it this bottle?

24
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't know either.

25
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I think it's pleasing to the eye.

26
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,039
One more thing,

27
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll leave it to you.

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
Just drink it.

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,919
Okay.

30
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
There are three rules

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to living here,

32
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,719
Don't make such a mess at home.

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Okay,

34
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,000
Clean it up later.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,639
Okay,

36
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,720
Second,

37
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,360
without my permission,

38
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,639
Don't drink my wine.

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,839
Okay.

40
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,560
Third,

41
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,959
I'll let you know when I think of it.

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay.

43
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,480
Thank you, brother.

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
Good morning.

45
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Morning

46
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,879
By the way,

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,879
the one who returned the card yesterday,

48
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,800
Here we go again.

49
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,560
Where is she?

50
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,279
It's still in the same private room.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, I got it.

52
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,639
You're here for spa treatment again.

53
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,399
My skin is a little short of water recently,

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,759
so I still need to take more care of it.

55
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,079
Have some fruit.

56
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sorry,

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,879
I just saw your WeChat message.

58
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,079
It's okay,

59
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,360
Tell your supervisor not to hide.

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,959
Today,

61
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,279
I have to return the card.

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,600
Chuchu,

63
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,360
can I discuss something with you?

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,920
This card

65
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,399
Can you return it next month?

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
Why?

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,600
To be honest,

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,759
our supervisor said,

69
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,079
As long as you don't return the card,

70
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,079
this order will be considered as my performance.

71
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,839
Actually, I was

72
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,120
in a relationship before.

73
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,680
After I graduate,

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll go back and marry him.

75
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,920
As a result, he cheated on me during the marriage,

76
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,639
and not only did I leave the house clean,

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,120
I have to pay him 2 million yuan.

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,959
I really had no choice

79
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,680
but to work in Shanghai.

80
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,000
So,

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,759
just do me a favor.

82
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,519
Okay?

83
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,519
For me, performance

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,720
is really important.

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,040
Please,

86
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,240
we're in the same boat.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,959
I also met a man,

88
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,600
I was with him for three months,

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,079
Only then did I know that

90
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,360
he was a liar.

91
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,519
He lied to me that

92
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,680
his card was frozen.

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,079
Then eat and wear my clothes.

94
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
In the end, I still owe more than 10 thousand

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
on my credit card.

96
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,839
I returned the card just to save the emergency.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
I see.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,279
All right,

99
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,319
I'll tell the supervisor

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,360
to return the card to you.

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Wait and see.

102
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,759
Hold on.

103
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,040
I know it's hard for you, too.

104
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Or don't return the card.

105
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,199
But isn't your money for emergency use?

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
I have other ways.

107
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,519
But I need you to cooperate with me.

108
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,920
What if it's done well?

109
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,519
Not only will I not return the card,

110
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,759
but I can also charge

111
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,839
tens of thousands more for you. Okay,

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,759
as long as I can help,

113
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll definitely help.

114
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,279
Okay. I'll contact you

115
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,800
tomorrow. Well,

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,759
Last time,

117
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,720
your cherries were not bad,

118
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,079
Give me another one.

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,399
Okay, just wait.

120
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,959
Here.

121
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,959
Hello.

122
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,800
Hello,

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,399
is this Ms. Wang Fen's house?

124
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,279
Yes.

125
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm Wang Fen's daughter.

126
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,439
What can I do for you?

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,480
We'd like to see your mother.

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you.

129
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
It can be considered as a fulfillment of my wish.

130
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,759
My condolences.

131
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,279
This is what we should do.

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,039
Du,

133
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,759
Life is too fast,

134
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,279
you must learn to cherish the people in front of you.

135
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,519
Don't worry.

136
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,759
Of course.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Let's go.

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,399
Ge Ge is back.

139
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,879
Come on. Have a seat.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
Are you tired?

141
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,399
I've prepared fruits for you today.

142
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,360
Eat more.

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
So happy,

144
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,279
Ge Ge,

145
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,519
Why did you give me the bank card?

146
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,320
Just keep it.

147
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,799
This is what I just did today.

148
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,799
Where is the password of this card?

149
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,960
It's your birthday.

150
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,320
As long as I have salary

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
and bonus in the future.

152
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll put them all in there.

153
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,399
I know there's no money in it now.

154
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,360
But one day,

155
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,399
I'll be able to pay back 2 million,

156
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,799
Okay,

157
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,279
I'll take it then.

158
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,120
It's such a time to celebrate.

159
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,279
I'll open a bottle of wine for you.

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
I can't help it

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,759
anymore. Go ahead.

162
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,120
Are you hiding something from me?

163
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
No.

164
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
I know everything.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,399
You haven't told me yet, have you?

166
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,639
Wait for me to take a bite,

167
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,320
and I'll say,

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,519
Actually.

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,279
I asked someone to charge

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,919
the first order you opened yesterday.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,279
What?

172
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
You're the one looking for someone.

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,519
I had a deal,

174
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,399
but I was quite happy.

175
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,240
I also feel that,

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,519
after all my hard work these days,

177
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,159
It finally paid off.

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
I didn't expect you to help me.

179
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,799
All my hopes for the future have been dashed.

180
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't.

181
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,600
If I do this,

182
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,720
Actually, I just want to

183
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,879
cheer you up.

184
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,519
To be honest,

185
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,559
do you think I can't do it?

186
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,639
No.

187
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,879
I think you've

188
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,200
improved a lot.

189
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,000
Got it.

190
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,840
All right,

191
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,200
I was wrong.

192
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,200
I shouldn't

193
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,679
have helped you in this way.

194
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,519
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

195
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,440
Swear,

196
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,519
don't hide it from me again.

197
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,559
I swear.

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,039
Pull the hook.

199
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,879
Whoever lies again will be a puppy.

200
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,799
Puppy.

201
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,840
Go ahead.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,399
What happened to your illness?

203
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,279
When did you know that?

204
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,840
That day,

205
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,919
when I brought you clothes,

206
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,320
I saw it by accident.

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
So,

208
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,879
the soya-bean milk machine,

209
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,720
Yes

210
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,600
I bought it out of my own pocket.

211
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,320
But you still spent so much money.

212
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,759
You bought me so many clothes,

213
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,559
I just wanted to

214
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,120
make you feel better.

215
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,279
It's not about

216
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,159
Ge Ge. It's such a big thing,

217
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,159
Why are you still hiding it from me?

218
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,919
What's the big deal?

219
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,320
It's not as serious as you said.

220
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Isn't it serious?

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
I've looked it up online.

222
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,159
According to the internet,

223
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,200
if the disease gets worse,

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,399
It's infertility.

225
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,840
You can't have a baby.

226
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,200
Gu Qiao,

227
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,600
according to the news on the internet,

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It's hard to tell whether it's true or not,

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,919
can we not believe the rumor or pass on the rumor?

230
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,600
Fine. I don't believe in rumors,

231
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
but what did the doctor say?

232
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Actually, when it comes

233
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
to women in the workplace,

234
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
It's quite common.

235
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,759
The doctor also told me that

236
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,759
I found it early.

237
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,519
As long as we cooperate with medication,

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,279
and have regular work and rest,

239
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,519
That's enough.

240
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,879
Really?

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
Okay,

242
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,879
no matter what,

243
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,799
I will face

244
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,039
this disease with you

245
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
We Shu Mei,

246
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,279
The contract with Star Media

247
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,440
will expire soon.

248
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,080
In the previous brand promotion,

249
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,159
I was the one who was in charge of it.

250
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,559
Now that we have the brand department,

251
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,960
of course,

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Mr. Du should be in charge.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
Then may I ask Mr. Du,

254
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,840
with regard to

255
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,519
Are we going to extend our contract with Xingkong?

256
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
What do you think?

257
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,840
I read

258
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,919
the company's previous promotion case,

259
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,720
As for the core idea,

260
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
Mr. Yuan has always been in charge of it.

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,759
Starry Sky is responsible for the execution.

262
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,159
But if you want to make

263
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,600
Li Juncheng bigger,

264
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,519
It's obviously not enough

265
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,679
to rely on our internal creativity.

266
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,320
I suggest changing the advertising company.

267
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,080
What's your opinion?

268
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,840
That's what I thought.

269
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Does Mr. Du have a target

270
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,000
for the advertising company he's working with?

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,159
Blue Eagle is good.

272
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
The resources are excellent,

273
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,759
and there have been many

274
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,720
successful cases in the past,

275
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,919
I asked around,

276
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,679
and their reputation in the industry

277
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,759
is also very good.

278
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,720
A good company's

279
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,440
asking price won't be too low.

280
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,000
Since we're going to transform,

281
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,679
the money we invested in the early stage,

282
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,960
There won't be any less.

283
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
We're fighting a time war now,

284
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,440
so Ge Zi,

285
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,360
You can give me

286
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,759
a more realistic budget,

287
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,120
At least let Bingwen know what to do.

288
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,639
The packaging and promotion

289
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,440
of all our Shumei products,

290
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,200
Along with Li Meng's

291
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,399
propaganda campaign,

292
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,519
The annual budget

293
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,039
can't exceed 15million.

294
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
15million?

295
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,200
For Shumei,

296
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
it's not a small amount,

297
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,320
Bing Wen

298
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,600
Is it difficult?

299
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,120
I'll do my best.

300
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,399
I'll make an appointment with Lan Ying and the others.

301
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,759
Let Yanxi help you.

302
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,039
In the previous commercial docking,

303
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,120
she was the one who did it.

304
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,559
And she is more familiar with

305
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,720
the domestic situation than you are,

306
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,399
Okay.

307
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,039
Gu Qiao,

308
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,799
I'm going to teach you

309
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,679
an urban

310
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
survival guide today.

311
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,720
You don't understand, do you?

312
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,960
I know what a survival guide is.

313
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I just don't know if we mean

314
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,559
the same thing, right?

315
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
What is a survival guide?

316
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,559
The competition between people,

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
on the surface,

318
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
is about houses, cars and tickets.

319
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,759
But in fact, the core competitiveness

320
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,679
is ability, resources and connections.

321
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,840
Especially his connections.

322
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,399
The circle around you

323
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,519
determines your height.

324
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
So the circle is very important.

325
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,759
What kind of person do you want to be?

326
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,240
What kind of circle do you want?

327
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,240
This is the survival guide.

328
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
I think what you said makes sense.

329
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
Of course,

330
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,200
the ancients said it well,

331
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,360
Birds of a feather flock together.

332
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
That's what I meant.

333
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
Ordinary people like us,

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,399
who want to gain a foothold in a metropolis like Shanghai,

335
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,399
You have to work harder than others

336
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,279
to manage yourself.

337
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,960
Look at me.

338
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
My dream is,

339
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,480
Within two years,

340
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,919
become the best female president

341
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,320
in Shanghai Bund?

342
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,840
So I have to work hard

343
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,120
to improve myself.

344
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
Get to know better people.

345
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,679
To create a better self.

346
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,879
Do you know how to break the circle?

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,159
Lang Da Byrne's

348
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,960
Law of Attraction,

349
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,919
Have you heard of it?

350
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,399
As long as you make yourself

351
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,639
a good person,

352
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,879
It will naturally attract

353
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,799
more effective contacts and resources.

354
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,440
But how to shape it?

355
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
I hired three teachers,

356
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,840
from the way of thinking,

357
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,399
When it comes to copywriting in Moments,

358
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,080
there are teachers who give you special guidance.

359
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,879
Time is limited,

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
let me tell you briefly.

361
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,559
What is this?

362
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,919
For an invitation to a business gathering,

363
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,559
I spent a lot of effort

364
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,840
to get it.

365
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240
When the time comes, you'll go with me,

366
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Me,

367
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,440
You have a good temperament,

368
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,279
and you know how to play it by ear.

369
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,000
I need you to cooperate with me.

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
No, no, I can't cooperate.

371
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,759
Here you are. Keep it.

372
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,079
You don't want to go?

373
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,559
I don't want to force you.

374
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,799
It's just that

375
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,039
I might have to return the card,

376
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,599
No,

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,079
I'll go.

378
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,559
I'll go. I'll go.

379
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,279
Okay,

380
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,240
The wine party is tomorrow night,

381
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,359
I'll give you

382
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,799
a simple training first,

383
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,359
The first step

384
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,559
is to learn how to set people up,

385
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,839
What about me?

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm a top student

387
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,119
who just graduated from Harvard,

388
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,160
And you, Master of Business Administration

389
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,920
from business school,

390
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,200
By the way,

391
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,799
this is the information.

392
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,559
I'll send it to you.

393
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,319
Recite it carefully.

394
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,799
I paid a lot of money

395
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,720
to buy this from the teacher.

396
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Internal information,

397
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,279
don't send it out.

398
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,480
I'll get going.

399
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,200
Goodbye.

400
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,839
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

401
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,119
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

402
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Thank you, Master.

403
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,319
What's going on? Aren't you

404
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,000
treating us

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,119
to afternoon tea?

406
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,519
Your name

407
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
is written on the takeout list I invited,

408
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:22,920
Take a look at this list.

409
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,559
This one looks good.

410
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,400
Fan Fan is right.

411
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,599
Mr. Yuan is really giving birth to

412
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,440
new shoots from old trees this time,

413
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,000
Dead trees bloom again.

414
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,319
Master,

415
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,039
I need you to sign a document.

416
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,880
Master,

417
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,799
are you really in love?

418
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,160
Master,

419
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,279
I thought you said that

420
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,519
women can only rely on themselves.

421
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,799
Can't we rely on men?

422
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,400
What did you say back then?

423
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,240
Tell me,

424
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Yeon-hee,

425
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,359
Only career is the most reliable.

426
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,960
So you have to spend all your time

427
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,759
at work.

428
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeon-hee,

429
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,359
you're still young,

430
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,240
It's not wrong to fight for a career.

431
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,480
But also put some energy

432
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,839
into life and love,

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,799
After all, work

434
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
is not the whole of life.

435
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,480
Okay, got it.

436
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
But what about myself?

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Or do you want to start a business before starting a family?

438
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,039
You're the one who gave me the dessert, right?

439
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,359
Do you still like it?

440
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,720
Yes,

441
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,079
thank you.

442
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,079
That's good. By the way,

443
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,440
this is for you.

444
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,519
What is this?

445
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,319
Thank you.

446
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,759
But you suddenly want to

447
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,799
give me a gift.

448
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,720
Is it because

449
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
I bought desserts for your friend,

450
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,880
So you want to make it up to me.

451
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,279
If you have to think that way,

452
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,880
it's not impossible.

453
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:25,960
Thank you.

454
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,400
Yuan Ge,

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,400
I have a party tomorrow night.

456
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,200
I'd like to invite you

457
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:45,920
with me. It's perfect.

458
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,680
I have a lot of friends

459
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,519
who want to know you,

460
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,559
What do you think?

461
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,200
Actually, I think

462
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,599
we're just friends.

463
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's go together.

464
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,200
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

465
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,079
That's right.

466
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I was too anxious.

467
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
You're thoughtless.

468
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,759
Yuan Ge, you know what?

469
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,279
Before I met you,

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,559
I didn't really

471
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,839
believe in love,

472
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,720
I don't have the courage.

473
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,759
To fall in love with someone,

474
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,079
I even think,

475
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,160
Dating is a waste of time,

476
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,160
but I'm

477
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,640
the only one who knows it.

478
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,440
It's just that

479
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't dare to take this step myself.

480
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
But all of this,

481
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,680
until I met you.

482
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,640
Only then did I realize that

483
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,200
you were the one

484
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,359
I wanted to wait for,

485
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,960
Because you're special

486
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,880
and unworldly.

487
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,680
I have my own ideas and opinions.

488
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,599
So I think,

489
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,599
I don't care what I do for you.

490
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,559
It's worth it.

491
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,680
I see what you mean.

492
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,559
But we just met.

493
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,200
I think

494
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
we need more time.

495
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,519
Let's get to know

496
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,720
each other better.

497
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,720
At tomorrow's cocktail party,

498
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,680
as a friend,

499
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,200
I'll join you.

500
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,279
Thank you.

501
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
Bingwen, what are you doing?

502
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,079
Why aren't you cooking yet?

503
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,279
I'm starving.

504
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
What are you doing?

505
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,559
Don't bother me.

506
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,519
I'll order takeout myself.

507
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,599
Hey,

508
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,079
What are you doing?

509
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,640
Can I help you?

510
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,920
Can't I call you

511
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
if I'm fine?

512
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,880
I'll hang up if it's okay.

513
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:12,720
Wait.

514
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,200
I know

515
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,400
a good restaurant,

516
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,599
Let's have dinner together tonight.

517
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,480
I have something to do. I'm driving.

518
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
You should go to that boring cocktail party

519
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,519
with that decent man.

520
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
If you're in a bad mood,

521
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,079
I'll open a bottle of red wine,

522
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:38,960
Drink with you.

523
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,839
Don't touch my wine.

524
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,359
Hurry up and order takeout.

525
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,200
Why are you still standing there?

526
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,759
I don't have money.

527
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,880
How have you been?

528
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,839
It's okay.

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,559
How are you?

530
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,039
I've been doing well recently.

531
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,480
Really?

532
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,759
-Long time no see. -Yes, long

533
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,839
time no see.

534
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,240

535
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
you're so beautiful today.

536
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,519

537
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,079

Let me introduce you.

541
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,319
This is my good friend Andy.

543
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,160
Hello, Andy.

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm

545
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,079

546
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,920
I've heard a lot about you. I've heard

547
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,920
Jinnan talk about you a lot lately.

548
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,119
I told you you're a good person,

549
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,119
coming to such an occasion,

550
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,200
I can't believe I'm not nervous at all.

551
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,079
I'm here,

552
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,599
mainly to get to know each other.

553
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,519
It's a bit complicated to say,

554
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
but in fact, it's just two words,

555
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,640
It's pleasing to the eye.

556
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,400
Look at that man over there.

557
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,839
About 35 years old,

558
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,079
with a good temperament,

559
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,440
The suit is custom-made,

560
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,279
and the watch is tasteful.

561
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,759
It's pleasing to the eye.

562
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
It's quite pleasing

563
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,440
to the eye. What's next,

564
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,519
We have to find a way to create opportunities.

565
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
To get to know him,

566
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,720
how can I cooperate with you?

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,119
Play it by ear.

568
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,400
Come on.

569
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,759
Hello.

570
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,200
See you later.

571
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,759
You look familiar to me.

572
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,359
Have we

573
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,359
met somewhere before?

574
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:10,960
Really?

575
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,680
Let me see.

576
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,519
Which party should it be?

577
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Or at a party.

578
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,720
Right, Gu Qiao? Yes,

579
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,599
he looks familiar.

580
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
Which company are you from?

581
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,720
After talking for so long,

582
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,960
I forgot to introduce myself.

583
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,319
My name is Chuchu,

584
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,640
Mayfly Feather.

585
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,519

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,160
is a good name,

587
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,680
Beautiful and charming.

588
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:39,920
This is my card.

589
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,960
Thank you.

590
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,599
Hello,

591
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,759
Mr. Zhu,

592
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,759
You can call me Alex.

593
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,759
Alex,

594
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,000
this English name is so foreign.

595
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,519
By the way,

596
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,440
today's reception

597
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,599
is held by the advertising

598
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,960
and art circles.

599
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,079
Which industry are you two from?

600
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,480
I just came back from abroad.

601
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,720
By the way,

602
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,119
this is my good friend Gu Qiao

603
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,039
Hello, my name is Gu Qiao,

604
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,519
It's business school Master of Business Administration,

605
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,000
Master of Business Administration,

606
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,720
Master of Business Administration,

607
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
I have a friend here,

608
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm from your business school.

609
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,480
Let me introduce you two to each other.

610
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,880
Hold on a second.

611
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
What should I do?

612
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,319
Why did you mention business school all of a sudden?

613
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
In the file you gave me,

614
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,240
that's what it says.

615
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,039
That's how I carried it.

616
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,079
What should we do now?

617
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,079
Let's go.

618
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,079
What else can I do?

619
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,640
Play it by ear.

620
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,680
Hi, I'm Andy.

621
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,960
I heard that you're also a business school student.

622
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,240
I'm Level 17.

623
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,720
What about you?

624
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,119
I … I'm 18.

625
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,480
Yeah, she's 18,

626
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,400
so I don't think you know her.

627
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,359
I don't know him.

628
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,279
What a coincidence.

629
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,079
I just met someone,

630
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,559
who is also in Grade 18.

631
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,680
She's right there.

632
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,799
Miss Yuan,

633
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
let's go.

634
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,599
Why did you suddenly raise Level 18?

635
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,119
I'm just saying, okay,

636
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,880
it's my fault this time.

637
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,640
As long as you don't return the card,

638
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,200
I'll cooperate with you in the future.

639
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,240
Let's go.

640
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,400
Later,

641
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,000
Gu Qiao,

642
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,759
Ge Ge.

643
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,000
What about this girl's Moments?

644
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,559
You look like a vain person,

645
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,279
I advise you to go with this kind of person,

646
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,720
You'd better keep your distance.

647
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,920
Why are you with her?

648
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,359
I'll wait for you in my room.

649
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,839
Then why are you with him?

650
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:17,799
You shouldn't be

651
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,839
with that man.

652
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,559
Zheng Jinnan and I,

653
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,920
it's not what you think.

654
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,319
He's not the kind of person you said.

655
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,960
What kind of person is that?

656
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,759
You told me,

657
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,119
there are no more secrets between us.

658
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,960
I put all my things,

659
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,279
all my weak side,

660
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,400
It's all in front of you.

661
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
But what about you?

662
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
You didn't tell me anything.

663
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,319
Do you think of me

664
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,599
as your best friend?

665
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,599
As for this matter,

666
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,200
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

667
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,559
I'll explain it to you

668
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,559
when I'm free.

669
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,279
Let's talk about you first.

670
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,720
Why are you

671
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,559
with Chuchu.

672
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,799
Didn't I remind you,

673
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,160
she is not a simple person?

674
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:01,839
Do you know

675
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,480
what she's doing?

676
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,960
You came with her,

677
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,640
in the eyes of others,

678
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,799
You are the same kind of people.

679
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,160
I can't help it.

680
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,400
I did it for my performance.

681
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,319
For the sake of performance,

682
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:13,880
for the sake of performance,

683
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,240
Can you take a shortcut?

684
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,319
For the sake of performance,

685
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,759
you can humiliate yourself like this?

686
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,079
Do you have a bottom line?

687
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,079
To humiliate yourself,

688
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,359
Yuan Ge, you always stand on

689
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,119
the commanding heights of morality and criticize me.

690
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,200
Have you ever thought for me

691
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,480
from my point of view?

692
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,559
Yes, you are a president.

693
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,960
You don't need to cater to others.

694
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,839
People are lining up

695
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,640
to curry favor with you.

696
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,640
But I'm different.

697
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm just a salesperson.

698
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,119
If I don't go with her today,

699
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,119
I'll lose my job.

700
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,839
As a salesperson,

701
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,960
did I do anything wrong?

702
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,839
Do you understand?

703
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,960
What am I talking about?

704
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,799
I brought you to Shanghai from my hometown,

705
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,640
not to let you

706
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,559
follow the old path,

707
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,680
That's how you look at me, right?

708
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,680
No,

709
00:33:59,359 --> 00:33:59,920
Me.

710
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,200
Where are you going?

711
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm sorry

712
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,480
for the number you dialed,

713
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,599
There's no answer for now.

714
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm honored.

715
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,400
As Party A this time,

716
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,320
Shu Mei can be so sincere,

717
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,679
I'm here to cooperate with Blue Eagle,

718
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,679
but Mr. Du is so kind,

719
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,199
We might not be able to take it.

720
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:41,880
Why did

721
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,039
Shumei buy Li Meng?

722
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,880
If you want to take a high-end route,

723
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
this is a risky move.

724
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,480
So in terms of resource allocation,

725
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,320
as Mr. Du said

726
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,599
in the email,

727
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,119
It must be top-notch,

728
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,400
and there must be no mistakes.

729
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,119
Blue Eagle is the leading

730
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,559
4A company in China,

731
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,800
In terms of resources,

732
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
I don't think you have to worry about it.

733
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,280
We don't lack resources,

734
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,559
but we won't be idle.

735
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,920
Waiting for Party A

736
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,960
to come to Mr. Du

737
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,159
to cooperate with us so rashly.

738
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,559
The time points given

739
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,440
are so close.

740
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,920
I think,

741
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,000
in any company,

742
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,280
It's impossible.

743
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,360
Unless we increase our manpower urgently.

744
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,639
Broaden the channels,

745
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,639
but that means,

746
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,760
The increase in cost,

747
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,280
Yes.

748
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,840
I really want to promote

749
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,920
this cooperation,

750
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,320
But the follow-up executive team

751
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,679
will have their own considerations.

752
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Mr. Du, if you find it difficult,

753
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,920
don't make it difficult.

754
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,480
Give me an offer.

755
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,000
Mr. Du, if you speak frankly,

756
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,519
I won't beat around the bush.

757
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,760
20million,

758
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
annual budget,

759
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,800
20million,

760
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,599
I'll solve the rest of the problems.

761
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,159
20million,

762
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,440
20million,

763
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,320
I was so scared

764
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,480
that I wanted to go to the toilet.

765
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,920
Go to the bathroom. Go ahead,

766
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,360
Mr. Du.

767
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,480
Please have some tea.

768
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,840
20million,

769
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,639
in that case,

770
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,519
It's quite different from what we expected.

771
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:30,519
I'll try my best to lower the price.

772
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,360
But how much can I press?

773
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,239
I don't know what to do.

774
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,480
I understand.

775
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,199
Bingwen,

776
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,960
don't put too much pressure on me.

777
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,679
I trust you.

778
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,719
Go ahead and talk about it.

779
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,519
Okay, got it.

780
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

781
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,119
Mr. Du, what do you think?

782
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,320
Here's the thing.

783
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,119
In general,

784
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,360
advertising companies,

785
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,159
It has to pass the bidding.

786
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,639
Then we can have

787
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,079
a formal partnership with our company.

788
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,159
What about the time?

789
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,360
It's usually one month or two months.

790
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,920
Some even take half a year.

791
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,440
I don't know.

792
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,039
Has Blue Eagle ever been

793
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,199
in such a situation,

794
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,559
Maybe

795
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,679
one month, two months,

796
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,039
half a year. After such a long time,

797
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,280
In the end, he became a running mate.

798
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
Nothing was collected.

799
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:27,760
Is there?

800
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,239
Does this have anything to do

801
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,159
with what we just talked about?

802
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,519
It's not a big deal.

803
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,880
If you can lower the price,

804
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,760
I can skip the bidding,

805
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,079
Just leave the contract,

806
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,519
Mr. Du has the final say on this matter.

807
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,639
I heard that

808
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,519
Mr. Yuan, the vice president of your company,

809
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,480
It's Dana.

810
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,079
Don't talk nonsense.

811
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,639
Our company has only one master,

812
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,480
Mr. Fu.

813
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:58,920
Okay,

814
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,599
1. 8thousand,

815
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,800
that's all I can do.

816
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,519
Can you lower it?

817
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,079
1. 8 Thousand can't lose even one point.

818
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,719
I just want to

819
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,639
make friends with you, Mr. Du,

820
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:14,880
Get ready to go back.

821
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
All kinds of preparations to brush your face and beg for help.

822
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,880
If you keep pressing my price,

823
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,760
there's really nothing I can do.

824
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,800
Okay,

825
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,159
1. 8thousand,

826
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,800
I won't press you on the price.

827
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,480
But I have one request,

828
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,960
all the promised resource allocation,

829
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,840
There is also a set time node.

830
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,599
We have to put it into the contract.

831
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,760
I'll fight for it,

832
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:46,599
Okay,

833
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,000
Wish us a happy cooperation.

834
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,960
Come on,
