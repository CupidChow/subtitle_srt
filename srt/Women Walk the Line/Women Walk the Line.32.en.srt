1
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,439
Mei,

2
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,920
if you don't drink the tea,

3
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
But it's getting cold.

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,759
Leopard,

5
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,759
how many years have you been with me?

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,360
It's been almost four years.

7
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,280
What's wrong, Mei?

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
It's been four years,

9
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
and I still remember when you came,

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
It should be the best time

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,919
for Shu Mei,

12
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,599
Shumei is fine now, too,

13
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,719
and with Li Meng,

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,680
So you think it's Shu Meihao?

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,919
Li Meng is better.

16
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,439
I think both of them are good.

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
It's all your hard work.

18
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,159
Yes.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,680
The palm of your hand is meat,

20
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,919
and the back of your hand is meat,

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,639
What if we have to choose one from the other?

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,199
Mei,

23
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,240
Actually,

24
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,400
Instead, I want you to choose one from the other.

25
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Over the years,

26
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,879
you've done so much

27
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,159
for Shumei.

28
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,159
Sometimes, I hope

29
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,520
you can think about yourself.

30
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,159
In this way,

31
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,000
you will have more time.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,080
You can stay with Baona.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
Do you know why

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,639
I'm in such a hurry

35
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,919
to send Li Yuan overseas?

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,039
Mei,

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
I don't know much about business logic.

38
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,479
But I think,

39
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,879
you want Baona to see it too,

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I really hope that one day,

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,920
she and her friends,

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,879
When I was shopping,

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,720
I saw Li Meng,

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,680
She can proudly tell people

45
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,079
that my mother did it.

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,959
Of course I will.

47
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,600
But to me,

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,519
Shumei means

49
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,480
something special.

50
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,720
It's my dream.

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,199
It's what I've been fighting for,

52
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
the goal for so many years,

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,839
A lot of people might think,

54
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,639
on that anniversary,

55
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,560
Everything I said was beautiful.

56
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,759
Back then, when I was Shumei,

57
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,720
I really hoped that I could,

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,959
All women can have

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,519
their own civilian makeup,

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,639
You know what?

61
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,560
In those days,

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,480
it was hard for a woman to break out.

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,079
Most people spend their whole lives,

64
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,680
All of them.

65
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,040
I dedicated myself to my family.

66
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,439
So I really want them

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,839
to love themselves a little more,

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Because of this,

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,560
Shumei is who we are today.

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,959
Let's put it this way,

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,720
actually, Shu Mei,

72
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,120
Just like me,

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
once

74
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,560
Brilliant.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,240
But after it blooms,

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
there will be bottlenecks.

77
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,680
You may even

78
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,120
have no other choice.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,519
In fact, in the past few years,

80
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,120
I know Ge Zi

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
has done his best,

82
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,920
If not,

83
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
when Shumei meets

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,560
so many competitors,

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
He died a long time ago.

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,079
So today, Li Meng,

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
it's hope,

88
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,639
I don't know. After

89
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,079
I missed this opportunity,

90
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,639
Wait for the next chance.

91
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,680
When will it take?

92
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,759
Mei,

93
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,040
in that case,

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,079
You've made up your mind.

95
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,800
Mr. Du,

96
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,879
let's talk,

97
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,319
It's a new dress.

98
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,920
It's beautiful.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
White,

100
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,160
I hate black the most,

101
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,560
Leopard Du Second Brother,

102
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,480
is Mr. Fu looking for me?

103
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Mr. Du, I said

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
it's Mr. Du.

105
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,279
Mr. Fu,

106
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Bingwen, come and have a seat.

107
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,039
Here's the thing.

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
I have a friend,

109
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,159
to introduce an

110
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,240
overseas channel,

111
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,600
I think it's a rare opportunity.

112
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,519
So I hope you can

113
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,360
help me investigate it.

114
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,159
Let's see if it's possible

115
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,360
to use this channel,

116
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
It can help Li Meng

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,080
expand overseas as soon as possible.

118
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,600
As for this matter,

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,279
I haven't told Gezi yet,

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
She's too cautious,

121
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,639
so I want you

122
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,840
to take a look first.

123
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll wait for you to come back.

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
We'll make a decision.

125
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
Here's the thing.

126
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,120
Where's Gu Qiao now,

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,159
We just settled Huamei Hotel,

128
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,799
and we want to enter

129
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,320
a high-end hotel chain in China,

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,200
Let Li Meng settle down at home first,

131
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,399
if he enters

132
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,840
the country rashly now,

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm just worried that I don't have enough energy.

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,960
We can't do well on both sides then.

135
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,840
Bingwen,

136
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,480
if Li Juncheng can settle abroad,

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,960
I believe our reputation in China

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,639
is bound to be higher.

139
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,279
Yes, that's for sure.

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
However,

141
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,440
we invested a lot of liquidity

142
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,919
in the early stage.

143
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,840
Even if there is a channel,

144
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,320
I think the financial pressure

145
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,399
is too great.

146
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,200
We might as well stabilize our country first.

147
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,759
Then we'll consider going abroad.

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,440
So I told you

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,559
to investigate first.

150
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes.

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,759
All right,

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
let's wait

153
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,320
until you're done

154
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,000
with the chain store.

155
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,679
Let's talk about it later.

156
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,399
Which side are you on first?

157
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,840
I said now

158
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,879
is not the time for us to take sides.

159
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,679
Now it's time for them

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
to make up quickly,

161
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
You think I don't want to?

162
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,120
But I talked for a long time,

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
but he didn't listen to me.

164
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,639
That's the only way.

165
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,879
Do you have any idea?

166
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,559
Well,

167
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,440
I'll book a place,

168
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,480
You bring your brother there,

169
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll bring my Ge Ge there,

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,200
Fine.

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,200
Sister-in-law, you're here.

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
Have a seat.

173
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,279
Here, here, here, here,

174
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
here,

175
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
here, here.

176
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Sit down.

177
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,559
My brother said,

178
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
Why aren't you here yet?

179
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,559
Isn't that it?

180
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,320
The steak has just arrived. It's hot.

181
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,159
Sister-in-law,

182
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,919
my brother asked you out for dinner today,

183
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,240
I just want to say sorry to you,

184
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,080
to say sorry,

185
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,840
Yes.

186
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,279
Ge Ge also said,

187
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,000
she will pay attention to it in the future.

188
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,639
Try not to make your brother jealous.

189
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,720
That's right.

190
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,320
So this is

191
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,120
a formal reconciliation, right?

192
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,279
Yes, we've made up. In that case,

193
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,000
let's touch one.

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,759
Let's touch one. Come on,

195
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,120
Touch one,

196
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,639
touch one, touch one, touch one,

197
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,080
You have to touch one.

198
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,639
Touch one.

199
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,480
Come on, let's go.

200
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,039
Ge Ge,

201
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,200
come on Sister-in-law

202
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,960
The medicine bottle is filled with vitamins,

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,600
Did Sun Bin say it himself?

204
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,960
If he's really sick,

205
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,320
why doesn't he dare to go for a check-up?

206
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,000
Tell me,

207
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,279
what is he

208
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,320
doing this for?

209
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,919
Then tell me,

210
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,600
he pretended to be sick,

211
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,440
And for what?

212
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,679
Because I like you,

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,639
pretending to be sick and pestering you,

214
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
You can't tell.

215
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
Let's not talk about him.

216
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,759
Aren't we going to have dinner today?

217
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,200
Right?

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,919
Yeah, I'm just happy

219
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,799
to eat out today.

220
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,480
For Kaixin,

221
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,559
didn't we make a deal, brother?

222
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,399
Do you believe me or not?

223
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,240
Of course I believe it.

224
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,759
Why are you still

225
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,679
saying that?

226
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,720
Will you believe it

227
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,799
only if he admits it in front of you?

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,279
Du Bingwen, can you do it?

229
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,440
Can you have a good meal?

230
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,639
Yes, you're right.

231
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,240
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat,

232
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,679
eat, eat,

233
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,519
Sister-in-law, have some.

234
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,000
Look,

235
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,320
it's okay if you see it.

236
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
That's it then.

237
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,279
Leader.

238
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,159
Well,

239
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
Leader,

240
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,960
Anything else?

241
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,879
A bucket of water is panting like this.

242
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,200
Sun,

243
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,919
you need to exercise.

244
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,600
I don't usually

245
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,559
have a chance

246
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,399
to exercise that,

247
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,320
If a leader like this

248
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,519
has this kind of tiring work in the future,

249
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
Leave them to me.

250
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,120
He asked me to exercise more.

251
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,799
If there's nothing else,

252
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,039
I'll get going.

253
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,159
Wait.

254
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,440
Sun,

255
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm going to meet a big client later,

256
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,240
Big client,

257
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,240
thank you for taking care of me.

258
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,639
It's not me. It's a client

259
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,080
who asked you to receive it.

260
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,759
You're lucky.

261
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,720
I've sent the address.

262
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,120
Make an appointment at six

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,440
o'clock. Come early.

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,240
Don't let him wait for you.

265
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Don't worry,

266
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,519
sir. Thank you.

267
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Thank you.

268
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:52,960
Hello,

269
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,879
sir. Hello,

270
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,320
It's not ready yet.

271
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,679
I arrived early.

272
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,120
You can sit in that room first.

273
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,679
Did you book that room too?

274
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
It's okay.

275
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,519
I'll just wait here.

276
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,159
Mr. Sun,

277
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,720
Mr. Du,

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
Why are you here?

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,919
Yes, it's me.

280
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,799
Then.

281
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,200
It's okay.

282
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,000
What do you want to eat?

283
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,639
Waiter.

284
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,120
Enjoy your meal.

285
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,799
Mr. Du,

286
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,399
you asked me to come here today.

287
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,360
Do you have something important to say?

288
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,120
I think Mr. Sun is great.

289
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,559
How did you do it that day?

290
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,880
As if

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,319
nothing had happened.

292
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,319
I know

293
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,599
what happened that day.

294
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,519
You were in a hurry that day,

295
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,200
but I didn't take it to heart.

296
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,359
I'm not mad at you.

297
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,880
We're the only ones here today.

298
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
Tell me the truth,

299
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,480
I admit

300
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,440
if depression is a good act.

301
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,480
Depression is fake.

302
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,640
You finally admit it.

303
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,359
Yes,

304
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,039
you're a client today,

305
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,599
What do you want me to say?

306
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,680
What did I say?

307
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,880
I have to cooperate.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
What else do you want to hear?

309
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,640
What do you mean? What do you want me to say?

310
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,759
What did you say?

311
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,759
I know.

312
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,839
You're aiming at me,

313
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,680
because you're worried

314
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,240
that I'll ruin your relationship, right?

315
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,200
But Yuan Ge and I

316
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,920
are just friends.

317
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,599
What's wrong?

318
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,359
If you're

319
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,279
really worried,

320
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:22,920
Okay,

321
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,599
I can

322
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,799
disappear from your world.

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,559
I can even

324
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,400
disappear from this world.

325
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
Are you schizophrenic?

326
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,079
Sorry,

327
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm not feeling well.

328
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,279
I need to take some medicine.

329
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,240
You admit that

330
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,160
you're not depressed anymore.

331
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,519
What else are you taking?

332
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,119
All right, Du Bingwen,

333
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,440
don't push him anymore.

334
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,079
I didn't force him.

335
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,079
Yuan Ge, why are you here?

336
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,599
Sun Bin, listen to me. Wait,

337
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,440
wait, wait,

338
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,240
Don't you want to take medicine?

339
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,799
Eat,

340
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,319
If you dare, eat all of them.

341
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,640
Du Bingwen,

342
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
Sun Bin, don't listen to him.

343
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't eat.

344
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,960
-Let him eat. -Sun Bin, don't

345
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,759
listen to him.

346
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
Sun Bin,

347
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,559
don't let him eat,

348
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,319
Du Bingwen, let go of me.

349
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,359
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

350
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,200
-He's hungry. -It's okay, Du

351
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,839
Bingwen. You've gone too far.

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
What can

353
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,759
vitamins do?

354
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,160
Sun Bin,

355
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,400
this is not a joke.

356
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,599
A lot of medicine!

357
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Du Bingwen, let go of me!

358
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,799
Don't be childish, okay?

359
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,519
Let go of me!

360
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,480
It's really okay. Let him eat.

361
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,400
Sun Bin,

362
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,559
Sun Bin,

363
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Are you okay?

364
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,079
Sun Bin,

365
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,920
don't you think it's good?

366
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
Du Bingwen, let go of me!

367
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,400
Sun Bin,

368
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,559
Yuan Ge,

369
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,279
It's okay.

370
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,079
It's vitamins.

371
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,960
Sorry,

372
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,480
I have to go now.

373
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,720
Did you hear that?

374
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,839
It's vitamins.

375
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,400
I told you

376
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,240
he's not depressed anymore.

377
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,559
He's just pretending to love acting,

378
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,400
but you've gone too far.

379
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,119
Sir,

380
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,920
Sir,

381
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,319
Sir, are you all right?

382
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,240
Sir,

383
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,720
why are you acting again?

384
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Excuse me.

385
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,480
Hang in there.

386
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't worry. We're at the hospital.

387
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,200
Family members, stay.

388
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,119
Don't worry.

389
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Doctor, how is he?

390
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,359
Luckily, it was delivered in time.

391
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,319
If it had been a little later,

392
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,519
The consequences are serious.

393
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,319
Oh my god.

394
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,359
Awesome.

395
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,119
Can you stop talking?

396
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,799
Is he a cow?

397
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,319
I'm impressed.

398
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,119
He risked his life

399
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,000
for you.

400
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,880
Do you think he's awesome or not?

401
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
Didn't you trick him out?

402
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,720
Didn't you force him?

403
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,039
He can kill himself if you don't force him.

404
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
What do you mean by forcing him?

405
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,119
No, he's lying there.

406
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,279
He's right, okay?

407
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,000
All right, Du Bingwen,

408
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,319
this is the hospital. Keep your voice down,

409
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,799
That's enough. Stop it.

410
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,279
Not only is he good at acting,

411
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,680
but he can also

412
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,680
risk his own life.

413
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm impressed.

414
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,880
I couldn't have done it.

415
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
It's enough for both of us.

416
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
What do you mean?

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,799
Break up.

418
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,079
How did Du Bingwen

419
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
break up just like that?

420
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,519
Does he think he's a three-year-old?

421
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,839
And you too,

422
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,880
I said you were at work,

423
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,119
You're quite vigorous,

424
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,079
why can't you be clear

425
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
when it comes to love?

426
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,559
Because of Sun Bin,

427
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
you two fought so many times.

428
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,599
How many times have I tried to persuade you?

429
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,079
I told you to stay away from him.

430
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,519
Have you ever heard of me?

431
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,799
You two are just ordinary friends

432
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
we met at the hospital,

433
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,400
Why does he keep pestering you?

434
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,839
Also,

435
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,079
this kind of person, on the surface,

436
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,519
He looks pollution-free,

437
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,720
looks innocent,

438
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
Actually, he's the most scheming.

439
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,279
All right. Don't drink too much.

440
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,200
Don't feel too bad.

441
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,160
Du Bingwen

442
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,720
must be angry,

443
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,640
So what I said to you was just angry words.

444
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,559
I'll go to the office tomorrow.

445
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
Talk to him.

446
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Don't think too much.

447
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,720
Come in,

448
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Mr. Yuan,

449
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,480
Mr. Du is not here today,

450
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
I can't reach him either.

451
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
This document is urgent.

452
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
Can you sign it for me?

453
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,599
Didn't Mr. Du come to work today?

454
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,880
Your phone is off too.

455
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

456
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,480
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Fu is looking for you.

457
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,119
Got it.

458
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,599
Ge Zi,

459
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,720
Mr. Fu, are you looking for me?

460
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,440
Yes.

461
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Here's the thing.

462
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Where's Bingwen,

463
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,720
He was sent abroad

464
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,440
to help me follow up

465
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,559
on Li Juncheng's matter,

466
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,200
So these days,

467
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Bingwen went abroad,

468
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,319
Yeah,

469
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,119
didn't he tell you?

470
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,640
Did you have a fight?

471
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,079
Is it because of work?

472
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,039
No.

473
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,920
Come on,

474
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,640
Come here.

475
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,880
Come here.

476
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,119
I want to have a good chat with you.

477
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,119
Sit down

478
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
I'm an experienced person,

479
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,519
so I'd like to talk to you.

480
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,119
It's a cliche. Don't think

481
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm annoying.

482
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,640
How could it be?

483
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,720
You know what?

484
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,759
In my time,

485
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,359
woman

486
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,720
If you're pretty and capable,

487
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,279
but you don't have any flaws,

488
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm sure it'll be magnified.

489
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,599
I still am.

490
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,720
It's often said on the Internet

491
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,319
that women are three tall,

492
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,839
It's hard for them to get married.

493
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,400
In the final analysis,

494
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,880
if a woman is too independent,

495
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,799
If you're too strong,

496
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,319
men will lose their sense of existence.

497
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,799
You have to know,

498
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,799
no matter where Bingwen is,

499
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,720
In fact, he is

500
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,279
a top-notch figure,

501
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,519
But the most rare thing is that

502
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,319
he has a good personality,

503
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,079
The one who can tolerate you must be strong,

504
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,440
This one

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,039
That's what you cherish the most.

506
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,000
Feelings are mutual,

507
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,680
and if either side

508
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,720
keeps giving unilaterally,

509
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,079
You'll get tired.

510
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,319
But don't worry too much.

511
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,559
After a while,

512
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
he will definitely come back.

513
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,559
When the time comes,

514
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
you can seize the opportunity,

515
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,119
Tell him

516
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,759
what's in your heart.

517
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,519
Mei,

518
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,440
thank you.

519
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,640
I'll get back to work then.

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Come on!

521
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,759
Okay.

522
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,519
You have no mood

523
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,559
at all.

524
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Even if you want to think about

525
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,839
our future?

526
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,480
Have you thought about it?

527
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,920
Of course I thought about it.

528
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
When we get married,

529
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,440
we don't have to live in the city.

530
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,640
We could move

531
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,240
a little farther from the city,

532
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,599
Build a small house.

533
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,279
The kind you decorate yourself.

534
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,880
Paint it yourself,

535
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,440
and bring our dad here.

536
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,720
Our dad lives on the first floor,

537
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,640
we live on the second floor,

538
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,880
Dad can do whatever he wants.

539
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,759
Raising flowers, grass,

540
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,119
cats, dogs and birds,

541
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,720
You can do whatever you want.

542
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,039
My girlfriend put it here.

543
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,680
Are you blaming my girlfriend?

544
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,559
Sorry,

545
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
the number you dialed

546
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,880
is not in service at the moment.

547
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,519
Please redial later.

548
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,319
Sorry,

549
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
the number you dialed

550
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
is not in service at the moment.

551
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Sun Bin,

552
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,640
why are you here?

553
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,640
Are you feeling better?

554
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,839
Much better.

555
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,960
I just want to apologize to Mr. Du.

556
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,639
But when I called him,

557
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,800
no one answered.

558
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm worried something will happen to him.

559
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,440
No,

560
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,639
he went abroad on business.

561
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,599
Maybe he's busy.

562
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,760
What's wrong with you?

563
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,119
It's okay. Maybe

564
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,360
I've been lying in the hospital for a long time,

565
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,519
My head hurts a little. Do you have hot water

566
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,760
at Yuan Ge's house?

567
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,480
Yes, you can come in first.

568
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,840
Be careful.

569
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,400
Drink some water.

570
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,599
Be careful it's hot.

571
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,639
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

572
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll make some.

573
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,360
No, thank you.

574
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,079
Aren't you feeling unwell?

575
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,159
Take a break.

576
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,800
you guys

577
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,360
Did you have a fight?

578
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:47,960
No.

579
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,079
You don't know

580
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,079
how to lie at all.

581
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,119
I know

582
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,360
you quarreled because of me,

583
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,840
If you're mad at me,

584
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,920
you can take it out on me,

585
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,159
If you have anything to say,

586
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,400
you can tell me,

587
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,440
Don't forget,

588
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
I promised you,

589
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,079
Make your tree hole.

590
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,199
It's okay,

591
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,440
You don't have to think too much.

592
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,400
We're fine.

593
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,920
maybe

594
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,840
When he comes back from his business trip,

595
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,079
we can talk about it.

596
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,679
But then again,

597
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,559
I can understand that he's mad at me,

598
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,000
But why do you think

599
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,760
he went abroad in a fit of pique?

600
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,079
By doing so,

601
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,519
he doesn't care about

602
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,800
your feelings, does he?

603
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,559
Have you ever thought about

604
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,400
Du Bingwen?

605
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,079
Too childish and childish,

606
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,079
but you are calm and restrained.

607
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,800
Is there a possibility?

608
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,000
you guys

609
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,760
It's not suitable at all.

610
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,639
Du Bingwen is not what you said.

611
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,800
Look at me,

612
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm dumb-mouthed,

613
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,039
I was just thinking about how to comfort you.

614
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,000
Sorry, Sun Bin,

615
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,519
I'm a little tired today,

616
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,119
I want to go to bed early.

617
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,719
I'll go back now.

618
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,000
If you want to talk to someone,

619
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,320
feel free to call me.

620
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,400
Go to bed early.

621
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,960
Hey,

622
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,400
Hello, Miss Gu,

623
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,760
Mr. Xiong's gastroenteritis,

624
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,920
I think he committed a crime.

625
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,679
He refused to go to the hospital.

626
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,280
Are you free now?

627
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,880
Can you come and talk to him?

628
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,800
He can't eat or drink

629
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,599
like this.

630
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,079
Okay,

631
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,039
I'll be right there.

632
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Come with me to the hospital.

633
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,599
Gu Qiao, why are you here?

634
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,559
Why are you trying to be brave?

635
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,119
Why don't you go to see a doctor?

636
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,480
It's okay.

637
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,360
It's an old problem, gastritis.

638
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,880
I've already taken the medicine.

639
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,119
I'll wait for you downstairs.

640
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,480
What do you think?

641
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,239
Are you feeling better?

642
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,320
I told you it's fine.

643
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,079
It's a waste of time to come to the hospital

644
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,440
and get an infusion.

645
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,559
Only when the doctor says it's okay is it okay.

646
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,079
No matter how capable you are,

647
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,639
can you cure yourself?

648
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,599
Have some water.

649
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,800
Thank you.

650
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Sister Chen told me that

651
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,840
recently,

652
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,039
I didn't even have a good rest.

653
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,320
No matter how busy you are at work,

654
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,639
you have to sleep.

655
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,199
I've been busy lately,

656
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,400
so I'll be fine in a few days.

657
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,679
Have a good rest.

658
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,679
It's a good thing there's nothing going on this time.

659
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,280
If anything happens to you,

660
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,239
what will happen to Ling Ling?

661
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,360
What about this big company?

662
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay, I'll listen to you.

663
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,440
Stay in the hospital

664
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,440
for a month

665
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,360
before going home.

666
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,159
What do you think?

667
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,360
You're still

668
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,760
in the mood to joke.

669
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,960
Drink the water.

670
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,800
Sleep a little longer.

671
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,119
I'll stay here with you.

672
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,079
Okay,
