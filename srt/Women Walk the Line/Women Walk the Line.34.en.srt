1
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,799
There are a lot of people here today,

2
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,480
so there are

3
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,959
a lot of follow-ups.

4
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,319
Mr. Yuan,

5
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,000
long time no see,

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,040
Long time no see Mr. Liang, Mr. Yuan

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Hello,

8
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,920
Hello,

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,359
everyone, please take your seats.

10
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,200
Mr. Yuan, please have a seat,

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,159
Ms. Zhang. Ms. Zhang,

12
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,079
Hello, Mr. Yuan. Long time no see.

13
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,280
Have a seat.

14
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,200
Thank you.

15
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,280
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Mr. Yuan,

17
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,879
to be honest,

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,400
I was supposed to sign a contract

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,439
with Li Ting today,

20
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,120
He was forcibly dragged here by Liang.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm curious to hear that

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,719
Shumei has made a big move,

23
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,479
What big move

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,360
do you have?

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,639
Tell us,

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,639
Yes,

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,599
If there's nothing new,

28
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,479
we'll find another way

29
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,319
to make money.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,039
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
That's right.

32
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,680
Ms. Zhang.

33
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,520
Thank you.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,400
Come on,

35
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,400
As we all know,

36
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,840
Shumei's position,

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,080
It's a cheap domestic product,

38
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,199
of course,

39
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,400
In the past,

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
our focus

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,400
was more on cosmetics,

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
But next,

43
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,879
Shumei

44
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,159
will make a breakthrough.

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,680
What breakthrough?

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,719
Mr. Yuan,

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
let's not talk about this,

48
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,759
Mr. Fu has been

49
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,400
focusing on building the Li family now.

50
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,919
Then Shumei's cheap domestic products,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,520
have they gone bad?

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,879
Yeah,

53
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,800
if that's

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
what you're saying now,

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm afraid

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
I can't listen to it now.

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,439
That's right,

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,080
Mr. Liang.

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Look,

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,599
so much foreign capital

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,159
has acquired Chinese brands,

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,639
Who suspects that their nature

63
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,639
has changed?

64
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
By the way,

65
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,800
Shu Mei is a Chinese company

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,639
born and raised.

67
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,840
We acquired a foreign brand,

68
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,840
and attacked jade with stones from other mountains.

69
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,240
Why not?

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,759
When you look at the plan carefully,

71
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,759
you will find that,

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
In fact, what Shu Mei wants to do

73
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,000
is not one,

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,319
Or a few brands,

75
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,439
but to complete

76
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,560
a complete set of cultural ecological chain.

77
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,960
Mr. Yuan,

78
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,719
the plan belongs to the plan.

79
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,240
But will it come true

80
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,599
in the end?

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
now

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,759
Isn't it still not a single word left?

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,199
Ms. Zhang,

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,360
I understand your concern.

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Actually, next Wednesday,

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,599
Shu Mei will hold

87
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
a big new product launch conference.

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,159
When the time comes, in addition to the release,

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,560
as mentioned in our plan,

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,080
In addition to the new products

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,039
associated with Guoman Culture,

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,960
He will also officially announce

93
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,319
Shumei's future plans,

94
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,520
We invited a lot of media,

95
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,319
to witness Shumei together.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,079
It can even be said that

97
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,600
the entire cosmetics industry,

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
For this initiative,

99
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,759
welcome Ms. Zhang.

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,600
And all of you, come and join us.

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Okay,

102
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,399
Let's

103
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,920
go to the press conference first.

104
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,560
Good for you, Mr. Yuan.

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
anyway

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,879
We're not in a hurry,

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
so let's open our eyes.

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
Okay,

109
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,519
Let's go and have a look.

110
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,120
No problem.

111
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,879
On behalf of Shumei Company,

112
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,800
welcome everyone.

113
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:42,959
Come on.

114
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,600
To Mr. Yuan, to Mr. Yuan, to Mr. Yuan.

115
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,800
Hello, Mr. Fu,

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,040
Okay.

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,519
Xia Meng,

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,279
when you pass by

119
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,079
Xintiandi tomorrow,

120
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,079
Remember to stop by

121
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,720
and check on the venue

122
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,680
over there. How is it going?

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Since you sat down,

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,839
you haven't even looked at me.

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,879
I'm sorry. I've been

126
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,639
really busy

127
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,680
these days.

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm so busy.

129
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,079
I don't mean to blame you.

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,160
I feel sorry for you.

131
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,920
It's busy and hard,

132
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,759
but I think

133
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm quite full.

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Most importantly,

135
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
it can help Ge Ge,

136
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,720
The feeling of the two of us

137
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
fighting side by side.

138
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,879
That's great.

139
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,800
It's good.

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,759
I heard from Shirley that

141
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,240
your activity this time,

142
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,319
I plan to re-activate

143
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,279
the copyright of Bai Xue,

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,439
It's been a long time

145
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,319
since Bai Xue plagiarized.

146
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
There should be no problem.

147
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,680
I strongly don't recommend

148
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,839
that you use her copyright,

149
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
After all, she had problems before,

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,759
and if there is another

151
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,800
public opinion storm,

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,800
It's not a good thing

153
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,800
for Shu Mei,

154
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,959
or for you.

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
But the truth is right there,

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
isn't it?

157
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,199
Even if some netizens

158
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,240
don't know what to say,

159
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,480
On the other hand,

160
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,079
it can also be said that this matter

161
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,360
has a hot topic,

162
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,480
Yes.

163
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,079
I have a friend

164
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,959
who also has

165
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,839
some good copyrights,

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,759
How about

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,480
I introduce it to you.

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
We had a deal.

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,839
We need to be clear about business. Besides,

170
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,360
we're running out of time.

171
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,839
Gu Qiao,

172
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,480
I don't think

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,399
it's urgent.

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,920
You should be cautious.

175
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,240
I'd rather postpone

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
the press conference. It's okay.

177
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,160
It's not like

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,639
your style of doing things.

179
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,800
Besides,

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,040
there's no problem with our copyright,

181
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,600
Right?

182
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,959
Of course not.

183
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,720
I just think,

184
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,360
okay,

185
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,399
I know you're doing this for my own good.

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,759
But I really don't have time.

187
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,439
As for the press conference,

188
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,639
we need more publicity

189
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,039
from you.

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,919
All right,

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
let's not talk about work,

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
When you're done with your work,

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,279
let's take Ling Ling on a trip.

194
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,480
Ling Ling told me before that

195
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,279
she wanted to see the snow,

196
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,720
We can find a place to have a look.

197
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,919
Okay.

198
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,919
You can decide when you're done.

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,840
Let's eat

200
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
-Okay. -You can't come

201
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,679
in. I got it.

202
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,000
Mr. Xiong

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,759
Qiming,

204
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
You may leave now.

205
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,480
What do you mean?

206
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,279
You told me.

207
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,120
As long as I find out the channel,

208
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,039
Fu Mei will let go.

209
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
But now Shumei

210
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
is holding a press conference

211
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
with great fanfare?

212
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
What kind of medicine are you selling?

213
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,320
Sit down

214
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
It's just a press conference.

215
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,240
It won't change anything.

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,039
Have some tea.

217
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,240
How can I not be anxious?

218
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,279
If this press conference

219
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,240
is successful,

220
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,679
Shumei's sales will soar.

221
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
How can I buy Shumei in the future?

222
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,679
Where is Fu Mei's centre of gravity now?

223
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,759
It's not on

224
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,759
Shumei anymore,

225
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,919
She held this press conference,

226
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,200
just to

227
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,559
raise the price.

228
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm telling you,

229
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,120
I don't have time

230
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,279
to bargain with her anymore.

231
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,799
Headquarters is giving me

232
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,519
an ultimatum now,

233
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,600
I have to buy Shumei this month.

234
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,039
This month.

235
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
This is the strategic cooperation agreement

236
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,679
between our company, Baolai Group,

237
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,080
and Guangke in the next three years,

238
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,399
How important is this cooperation?

239
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,960
I don't need to say more.

240
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't let me down.

241
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,360
What do you mean?

242
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,159
If you call Fu Mei right now

243
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,840
and tell her,

244
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,519
If we ask her

245
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,399
to cancel the press conference,

246
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,240
I'll sign and seal it right away.

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,960
and

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
I'll give you the first one right away.

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
In order to relieve the danger

250
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
of your Light Branch.

251
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,919
What if I don't agree?

252
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,240
I heard that at this press conference,

253
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Shumei is working with Bai Xue,

254
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,799
the national cartoonist who got caught in plagiarism, right?

255
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,799
You know that, right?

256
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,879
Bai Xue's plagiarism is fake,

257
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,799
which has been

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,440
clarified before.

259
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,559
It's not that simple.

260
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,960
Did I hear that the person

261
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,639
who broke the plagiarism is Jia Long?

262
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,240
He suddenly changed his mind and said that

263
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,919
he was hyped by the wave.

264
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,799
And she left Shi Wei.

265
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
What a coincidence,

266
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,759
Here you are. It must be strange

267
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,639
about your optical department.

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,080
I don't think

269
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,879
it's a problem.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Xiong Qiming,

271
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,519
you're smart.

272
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
I hope you can give me

273
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,960
a satisfactory answer as soon as possible.

274
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,600
Hello,

275
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,159
Mr. Xiong,

276
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,879
Mr. Fu,

277
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,159
now that you've sent Mr. Du

278
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,360
to the United States to connect channels.

279
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,120
Then why did you take the trouble

280
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,000
to hold such a big press conference

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
for Shu Mei?

282
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,240
Yuan Ge proposed

283
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,320
the press conference.

284
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,360
She has always been persistent in doing things.

285
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,000
As her boss,

286
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,919
I have no reason not to encourage employees

287
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,039
to work actively.

288
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,799
What's more,

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,799
if the press conference is done well,

290
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,919
Then Shu Mei

291
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,879
can sell it for a better price.

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,279
Don't you think so?

293
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,759
But the price from Baolai

294
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,080
is really sincere.

295
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,159
Mr. Fu,

296
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,639
about the press conference,

297
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
Please think about it.

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,000
Mr. Xiong,

299
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,720
you're a businessman too,

300
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,720
There's no reason why you don't understand me,

301
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,440
after all, Bao Lai

302
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,039
hasn't officially signed a contract with me yet.

303
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,240
Plus the channels in the United States,

304
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,679
will it work?

305
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,159
Du Bingwen

306
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,279
is still in the United States and he didn't give me

307
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,000
a definite answer

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,879
during the investigation.

309
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,919
Then I think,

310
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,000
if we can,

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,960
We can get one more chance.

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
There's no reason not to fight for it.

313
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,840
Mr. Fu,

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,879
but I think,

315
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,559
Mr. Xiong,

316
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,960
actually, right now,

317
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm still working,

318
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,399
so I won't talk to you anymore.

319
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
Why don't you have something to do?

320
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,879
After the press conference,

321
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,600
we'll talk about it,

322
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Okay,

323
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,679
Goodbye.

324
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
Sorry, Mr. Xiong.

325
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
There's a traffic jam,

326
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
Shelley,

327
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
How long have you been in the company?

328
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,519
Almost ten years,

329
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,879
ten years,

330
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,559
We've spent

331
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,799
so many years,

332
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,879
You've put so much effort into it,

333
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,960
so that Guangke,

334
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,080
Step by step

335
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,519
and climb to where you are now.

336
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,759
It's not easy.

337
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,240
It's really not easy.

338
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,600
Sherry,

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,159
you must be well aware of

340
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,240
the company's financial crisis.

341
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,799
I can't see

342
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,799
all my years of business results

343
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,440
go down the drain.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But Mr. Xiong,

345
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,080
we've tried to

346
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,639
turn the tide,

347
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,279
It's not that there's no other way.

348
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,720
Mr. Xiong,

349
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,200
You,

350
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,720
David

351
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,600
gave us

352
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,000
a three-year cooperation contract,

353
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,360
At least it can alleviate

354
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,639
the urgent need of Guangke.

355
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,039
Give the company more time

356
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,960
to resume normal operation.

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
Only when the company returns to normal operation,

358
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,960
can we have ten more years.

359
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,080
Whether it's David

360
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,279
or Fu Mei?

361
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,120
In front of me,

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
I want to maximize

363
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,799
all the benefits.

364
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,240
There are no absolute friends,

365
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
only absolute interests.

366
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,120
I see.

367
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,840
What do you need me to do?

368
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,519
Distinguished guests

369
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,360
and friends,

370
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Hello,

371
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,279
I'm the host of

372
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,879
today's press conference,

373
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,480
Gu Qiao.

374
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,759
First of all,

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,039
on behalf of all Shumei employees,

376
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,840
Thank you for coming today.

377
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,159
Everyone should know Shu Mei

378
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,120
very well.

379
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,080
And Mr. Fu,

380
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,360
the original intention of building Shumei.

381
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,200
I just want to make

382
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,240
a cheap skin care product

383
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,360
that can be used by women all over the country,

384
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,279
In the past ten years,

385
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,159
we have worked hard to achieve it.

386
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,320
Today,

387
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,519
the theme of our press conference is

388
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,360
Rise,

389
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,880
Shumei will

390
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,240
combine with intangible culture,

391
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
In addition to producing skin care products,

392
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,839
we will also launch a variety of cultural products.

393
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,079
At the same time, we will carry forward

394
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
our national culture.

395
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,799
Next,

396
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,400
please take a look at our promotional video.

397
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,519
Hello,

398
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm Jia Long,

399
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
I want to tell you something today,

400
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,680
my grandfather was an early comic book painter

401
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
in China,

402
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,440
Bai Xue's previous work

403
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,240
was indeed plagiarized

404
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,119
from my grandfather's comic book,

405
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,160
I didn't say it before,

406
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,720
because someone threatened me in Shumei,

407
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,440
What's going on?

408
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,440
I was afraid that they would hurt me

409
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
and my family,

410
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,640
So I didn't dare to come forward,

411
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,720
but today,

412
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,640
They even cooperated with Bai Xue,

413
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
and jointly held a press conference.

414
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm standing up now.

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
Declare this matter,

416
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,480
if you don't believe me,

417
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,559
I'll post

418
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,599
all the evidence online,

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,319
For their benefit,

420
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
Shumei threatened me in all kinds of ways,

421
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Forcing me,

422
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,680
not allowing me

423
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,720
to make such a statement,

424
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm going to do it for my grandpa

425
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,079
today. What's going on?

426
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,799
To get this justice back.

427
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,680
Mr. Fu Mr. Fu,

428
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,799
is what Jia Long

429
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,359
just said true?

430
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,319
How do you explain it?

431
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,559
President Fu

432
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,119
Threatening Jia Long to turn black and white upside down.

433
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,079
Working with plagiarists

434
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,960
to deceive consumers.

435
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,200
Is it the way

436
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,640
the company controls costs?

437
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,359
Gu Qiao Gu Qiao,

438
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,200
what's going on?

439
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Has Shu Mei really been

440
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,920
lying to the public?

441
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
Please give me an explanation.

442
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,880
Can plagiarism be considered as a national culture?

443
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,559
I'm sorry,

444
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,319
everyone. Calm down,

445
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,079
Please answer

446
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,720
our question directly,

447
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,200
We will explain this matter to you

448
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,240
as soon as possible.

449
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,640
As for this matter,

450
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,559
we still need time to investigate.

451
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,039
Please trust Shumei.

452
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,960
If you don't answer directly,

453
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,720
is it because you feel guilty?

454
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,680
How long is it as soon as possible?

455
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,599
Is it now?

456
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,559
What about the loss of shareholders

457
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,200
this time?

458
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,240
What is the truth?

459
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,200
Please explain to us,

460
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
can you answer

461
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,240
our question directly,

462
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Give us an explanation.

463
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,480
-Yes. -Explain it.

464
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,319
Answer our questions

465
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,799
formally

466
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,920
and give us an explanation.

467
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,759
Mr. Xiong

468
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Bao Lai's contract

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,039
has been sealed.

470
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,000
The finance department said that the first payment

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
has been paid.

472
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,440
Got it.

473
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,400
Mr. Fu,

474
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm sorry,

475
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,720
About Jia Long,

476
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,599
it's my fault.

477
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,759
But what Jia Long said

479
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,960
is not true.

480
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,160
We still have a chance.

481
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,119
Mr. Fu,

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,599
I'm also responsible for this.

483
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,160
We'll find a way to make it up to you.

484
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,839
None of your business.

485
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,160
Now that this matter has turned into

486
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
what it is today,

487
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
I know

488
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,920
you don't want to see it either.

489
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,519
For the rest of the work,

490
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,279
I'll ask Zhang Wei to handle it.

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

492
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,480
Mr. Fu,

493
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,440
have you decided

494
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,759
to sell Shu Mei?

495
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,200
Ge Zi.

496
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,440
You should also learn

497
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,319
to let go of your obsession.

498
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,160
It's not obsession,

499
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,839
it's a dream you gave me.

500
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,079
In the year I graduated from college,

501
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,079
I became Shu Mei with you,

502
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,119
I've made this

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,279
my dream

504
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,440
all my life.

505
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
Didn't you also tell me that

506
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,240
Shumei is also

507
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,279
your dream in this life?

508
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Ge Zi,

509
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,039
we've done our best.

510
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
As a boss,

511
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,279
dreams are not enough.

512
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,319
I have to be responsible for the jobs

513
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,759
of hundreds of people in the whole company,

514
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,799
You can afford it.

515
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,359
What about everyone?

516
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,839
As you know,

517
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,359
Shumei has been stuck

518
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,400
in a bottleneck

519
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,759
for a long time.

520
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,799
I'm sorry,

521
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sorry,

522
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,319
Mr. Fu,

523
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,359
I know you want to be Li Wen Chang.

524
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,400
But Li Juncheng

525
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,480
is the brand we acquired,

526
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,039
And Shumei

527
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,400
was founded by you.

528
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,480
It's our own brand

529
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,519
in China,

530
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
Do you really have the heart to do that?

531
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,799
Put it in the hands of

532
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,519
foreign capital?

533
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,240
Mr. Fu,

534
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,279
I know.

535
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
This press conference

536
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,920
will have a big impact on us.

537
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,079
Can you give me another chance?

538
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll do everything I can.

539
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,680
That's enough.

540
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,920
I've made up my mind.

541
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,440
I know it's been hard

542
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,759
for you two these days.

543
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,279
Go back

544
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,680
and rest for a while.

545
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,039
Get out.

546
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,160
It has already happened.

547
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,799
Don't think too much.

548
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,839
Go home first.

549
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,880
What's going on?

550
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,960
I don't know either.

551
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,640
But aren't you always

552
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
in charge of backstage?

553
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,480
I was in charge before.

554
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,079
But then Shirley

555
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,920
insisted on using her people to control it.

556
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,599
I don't think it's urgent.

557
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,119
You should be cautious.

558
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,400
It doesn't matter

559
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,240
if we postpone the press conference.

560
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
There's nothing wrong with our copyright,

561
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,039
right?

562
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Of course not.

563
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,519
Are you helping me

564
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,640
with Jia Long's matter?

565
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,759
I did help you last time.

566
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,759
After all, I know Mr. Wang,

567
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,839
but this has nothing to do with me.

568
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
You may leave now.

569
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,599
Okay.

570
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,680
Put it on.

571
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,079
You'll catch a cold.

572
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,799
Don't you have anything to say to me?

573
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,920
What do you want to hear from me?

574
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,160
Okay,

575
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,039
Then let me ask you,

576
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,039
why did Jia Long clarify it?

577
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,240
He said it was all a misunderstanding.

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,559
What happened today happened.

579
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,599
I knew you would come to me.

580
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes,

581
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,759
I'm the one looking for Jia Long,

582
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,359
I'll exchange my position as a manager

583
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,160
with him.

584
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,480
I asked him to clarify on his own initiative.

585
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,960
I asked you before,

586
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,880
but you said you had nothing to do

587
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,799
with this matter.

588
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,519
Why did you lie to me?

589
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
Because I don't want to see

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,240
you bear an unwarranted crime.

591
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,519
I don't want to see you

592
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,319
squatting in front of Bai Xue's house every day,

593
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,640
I can't accept it.

594
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,839
You were under so much pressure,

595
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,880
but I didn't do anything about it.

596
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,720
Okay,

597
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,440
Okay, you did it for my own good,

598
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,480
but that's totally different.

599
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:24,920
You know what?

600
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,200
That was Mr. Jia's

601
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,359
painstaking effort all his life.

602
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,359
Just because you're nice to me,

603
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,240
you can't put your pain

604
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,599
on someone else.

605
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,519
I don't think I did anything wrong.

606
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,200
I didn't force Jia Long.

607
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,160
He did it voluntarily.

608
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,759
I only gave him one choice.

609
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
But Jia Long is a person

610
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,119
who does nothing for profit.

611
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,359
But you know what?

612
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,039
If Jia Long

613
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,079
hadn't been bribed by you.

614
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,240
Bai Xue

615
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,160
You will be punished.

616
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
And Shumei will work

617
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,599
with Mr. Jia,

618
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,400
To save the situation back then.

619
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
It wouldn't have

620
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,599
ended up like this.

621
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,440
Sorry,

622
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,000
that's not important to me at all.

623
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,400
But what I did today,

624
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,359
I did it for you.

625
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,559
Yes.

626
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,839
It's all for me.

627
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,000
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

628
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,160
Even if you think

629
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,480
it's Jia Long's own choice.

630
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,559
But what about the press conference?

631
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,079
Who planned the press conference?

632
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,680
You arranged this too, didn't you?

633
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,160
Do you know

634
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,279
what Shu Mei means

635
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,160
to Yuan Ge and me?

636
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,000
You know how important

637
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,759
this press conference is to Shumei.

638
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,720
But what about you?

639
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
You'd better work with Jia Long

640
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,559
to embarrass Shumei

641
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,319
at the press conference,

642
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,160
Why?

643
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,119
Because Guangke

644
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,319
is in a big financial crisis.

645
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,880
Borai wants to buy Shumei?

646
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,440
They're looking for me.

647
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,319
They want my help?

648
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,319
They promised me that

649
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,880
they could help me solve my crisis.

650
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,000
In order to save Guangke,

651
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
I saved my years of hard work.

652
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,119
I have no choice.

653
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,319
I have no choice.

654
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,599
So you ruined

655
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,839
Shu Mei's reputation for yourself?

656
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,599
Bao Lai knew

657
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,519
Jia Long existed for a long time.

658
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,160
They are determined to win the acquisition.

659
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,039
Even if I didn't do it today,

660
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,400
Shumei would end up like this.

661
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
It will still be the same.

662
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,559
So,

663
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,759
you'd rather be Borai's promoter

664
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,599
and help them, right?

665
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,880
Even if you don't have Shu Mei,

666
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,920
you still have Li Meng,

667
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,240
I've helped you get

668
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,599
Li's overseas channel.

669
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,279
Gu Qiao,

670
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
it's not

671
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,319
as bad as you think,

672
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,279
Okay?

673
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,119
No.

674
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,440
You have no idea.

675
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,400
You don't even know

676
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,079
the difference between Li Meng and Shu Mei.

677
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,640
Do you know the meaning

678
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,960
of Shu Mei?

679
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
This is a national brand

680
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,359
that has worked hard for ten years,

681
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you know what it will face

682
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,079
if it falls into

683
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,400
the hands of foreign capital?

684
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes.

685
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,599
Maybe for you,

686
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,799
the word "national brand",

687
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,960
It's just a publicity stunt.

688
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,599
The publicity stunt,

689
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,079
everything I did,

690
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,720
It's all for you.

691
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
Don't you get it?

692
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,839
If I hadn't used Jia Long,

693
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,359
you would have been fired by Shumei.

694
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
If I don't let Jia Long

695
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,599
bite back,

696
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,440
My Guangke will disappear too.

697
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,039
If I'm indecisive and hesitant

698
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,640
in the mall,

699
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,240
I can't climb to

700
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,480
where I am today.

701
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,200
Gu Qiao,

702
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,359
in this world where the weak

703
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:27,960
are prey to the strong,

704
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,079
I don't trust anyone.

705
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,839
I can only protect myself.

706
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,359
Yourself,

707
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,039
so everything you do,

708
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,119
It's all for yourself.

709
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,240
Then why are you

710
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,119
with me,

711
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,480
Is it because you think

712
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I can take care of Ling Ling?

713
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,079
Or do you think I'm just like you?

714
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,880
When I'm with you,

715
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,839
I'm doing it for myself.

716
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,279
Let me tell you,

717
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,519
I'm different from you.

718
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,720
Yuan Ge is right,

719
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,839
you are a businessman,

720
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
Interest

721
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,519
is always your first choice.

722
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,719
Gu Qiao,

723
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,280
it's not like that.

724
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,920
Let me explain.

725
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,760
Let's call it

726
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,880
a day.

727
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,559
Well,

728
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,440
in order to thank you for taking the time

729
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,599
to celebrate Ling Ling's birthday with her,

730
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
It's

731
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:04,679
a gift from me.

732
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,679
It's just a small memorial.

733
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,880
Gu Qiao is going to

734
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,480
have dinner with us today,

735
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,079
Are you happy?

736
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,400
Kaixin,

737
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,519
it would be better if Gu Qiao

738
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,800
could stay at my house every day.

739
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,519
In your heart,

740
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,880
apart from being Ling Ling's father,

741
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,639
And the boss of Guangke,

742
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,519
is there anything else?

743
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
before

744
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,639
I hesitate and struggle too.

745
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
But I've figured it out.

746
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,239
If two people really like each other,

747
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,239
they should cherish this relationship.

748
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,440
In the year I graduated from college,

749
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,679
I became Shu Mei with you,

750
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,079
I've made this

751
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,360
my dream

752
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,440
all my life,

753
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
Borai wants to buy Shumei?

754
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,079
They're looking for me.

755
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,000
They want my help?

756
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,000
They promised me that

757
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,400
they could help me solve my crisis.

758
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
In order to save Guangke,

759
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,519
I saved my years of hard work.

760
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,519
I have no choice.

761
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,159
In this world where the weak

762
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:11,719
are prey to the strong,

763
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
I don't trust anyone.

764
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,079
I can only protect myself.
