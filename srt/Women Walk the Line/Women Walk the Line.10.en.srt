1
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,030
Come in.

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
It's a little hot.

3
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,150
Thank you.

4
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,430
Have you applied medicine?

5
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,310
Yes.

6
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,590
Mr. Du,

7
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,710
I have something else to do.

8
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,560
Something personal.

9
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,750
Do you have time after work?

10
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,120
Tell me now.

11
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,430
I have time now,

12
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,310
now,

13
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,280
Sure

14
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,030
Be mentally prepared.

15
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,310
It's not a good thing.

16
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,400
I saw a real man

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,030
with a little girl

18
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,710
at the Wellcome Hotel,

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,710
And then?

20
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,750
And then,

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,430
they held hands,

22
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,710
He behaved very intimately.

23
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,870
It doesn't look like

24
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,150
a normal relationship.

25
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,750
You think I'm lying to you?

26
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Blue Eagle's men were there that day.

27
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,000
If you don't believe me,

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
you can go to Weilai's surveillance camera.

29
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,560
Mr. Du, is that all?

30
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,360
You can go back now.

31
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,590
You knew it already.

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,710
Why are you like this now?

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
Even if you can't find a boyfriend,

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
you shouldn't belittle yourself.

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
I'm looking for such a thing.

36
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,750
You're pretty

37
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
and in good shape,

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,800
With good skin,

39
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,910
economy and independence,

40
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,960
What kind of boyfriend are you looking for?

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
Zheng Jinnan and I have broken up.

42
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,190
It's my fault.

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
It had nothing to do with me.

44
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,750
Sister, come with me. Don't say

45
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,000
that I don't repay your kindness.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,950
I'm here to bring you medicine.

47
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,430
You're popular,

48
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,000
aren't you?

49
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,040
Play on your own.

50
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
The color just now is not so good.

51
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,920
I think it's pink.

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,630
Okay.

53
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,190
How about this?

54
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,360
It's okay. Where are you doing your

55
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,830
online shopping?

56
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,240
No.

57
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,830
I heard you asked for leave yesterday.

58
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,600
What are you doing?

59
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
I have something personal,

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Gu Qiao,

61
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Don't blame me.

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,480
I didn't remind you.

63
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,630
It's taboo for a new employee

64
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,830
to ask for leave in the company.

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
Since it's a probation period,

66
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,070
you have to show

67
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,720
your enthusiasm for the company's work,

68
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,390
Play less with your phone,

69
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,870
work more,

70
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
Thanks for reminding me.

71
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,510
If you have nothing to do,

72
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,750
can you copy two documents for me?

73
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,830
Okay, no problem.

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,600
Thank you.

75
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,750
Miss Gu Qiao,

76
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,040
can I help you?

77
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
This shows a paper jam,

78
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,510
but I don't know how to do it either.

79
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,920
This machine

80
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,950
is not working well recently.

81
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll get someone to fix it later.

82
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,750
What do you want to copy?

83
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,430
For last month's sales report,

84
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,000
it must be Wang Mei's job for you again.

85
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,750
Then you can assign me

86
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,070
some serious work.

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
It's better to be able to

88
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,120
help your master. Master said,

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,390
Your first priority now,

90
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,240
is to get familiar with the company's environment,

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't worry.

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,390
I'm with her.

93
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,160
Okay, thank you.

94
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,120
Call me if you need anything.

95
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Go shopping later.

96
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Let's have a meal together.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,950
Xia Meng is gone.

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,510
Let's go.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
I can't do anything.

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,510
You're working overtime after we leave.

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,270
What are you doing?

102
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,920
That's funny.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Yanxi, we're leaving.

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,430
-I'm leaving. -Slowly.

105
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,750
Goodbye.

106
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,600
Goodbye. Goodbye.

107
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,160
Eat whatever you want.

108
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,160
I don't know.

109
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,870
Master, I'm leaving.

110
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,120
Goodbye. Goodbye.

111
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,240
Miss Gu Qiao,

112
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,430
Master

113
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,390
should be there for a while,

114
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,870
It's okay. I'll wait for her.

115
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,680
Anyway, when we go back,

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
we have to wait for her to have dinner together.

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
I'll get going then.

118
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,160
Be careful.

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Goodbye.

120
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,870
The chef is finally cooking.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,870
What are you going to do today?

122
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,840
Where have you been these days?

123
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
I just.

124
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,030
Go to play with my brother. What's wrong

125
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,840
with your mouth?

126
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,150
Who hit you?

127
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,390
Get off.

128
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,030
If you fight with someone,

129
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,030
no one dares to beat you.

130
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,000
Shanghai is our territory.

131
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,120
Don't worry,

132
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
I know a lot of friends in Shanghai,

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,870
so I'll avenge you.

134
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320
Don't worry. I'm not beaten.

135
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
For women.

136
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,550
How do you know?

137
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,630
How is it going?

138
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Let me ask you a question.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,150
Forget it. It's no use asking.

140
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,840
Come on, brother.

141
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,840
The so-called authorities are obsessed,

142
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,670
The onlookers are clear.

143
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,790
It's about two people

144
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,870
working together to solve the problem.

145
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,150
It'll be faster and more efficient.

146
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,960
It's not over yet.

147
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Almost there.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,870
Do I know how you got here

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,320
all these years?

150
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
You too.

151
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,910
You have to be mentally prepared.

152
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,440
I won't let anyone down

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,360
if I work hard.

154
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,600
That makes sense.

155
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Tell me,

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,910
does anyone in our company

157
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,870
like Mr. Du?

158
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
What do you mean?

159
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,630
Isn't Du's mouth

160
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,670
hurt?

161
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,150
As an old classmate,

162
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,550
I went to offer my condolences.

163
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,630
I bought some medicine,

164
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,030
and I found out,

165
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,390
Someone already courted me

166
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,200
earlier than I did.

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
What's so strange about that?

168
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,600
As the director of the company,

169
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,390
he goes in and out of the company every day with injuries,

170
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,630
If it's bad for the company's image,

171
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,550
maybe some colleagues

172
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,750
can't stand it anymore, right?

173
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
I see. What else

174
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,910
can I do?

175
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,360
Let's go home.

176
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,910
I see.

177
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,550
The woman you like,

178
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,960
was cheated on.

179
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,390
But she still

180
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,550
doesn't care about it every day.

181
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,510
And I can go to and from work normally.

182
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,080
Am I right?

183
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,630
First of all,

184
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,480
I'm very happy for you.

185
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,840
Trust your mom.

186
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,360
When my aunt knows it,

187
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
she'll be very happy.

188
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,270
But at the same time,

189
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm also worried about you.

190
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,080
It's hard to have a crush on someone.

191
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,360
Listen,

192
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,750
what about a girl

193
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,150
who seems to be strong?

194
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,320
The more vulnerable your heart is.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,720
But it happened to be this kind of man.

196
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
This kind of man,

197
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
the more he can please this kind of girl.

198
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,440
So, Bingwen,

199
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,630
give up.

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,550
Change the target.

201
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,550
Tell me,

202
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,960
will there be such a situation?

203
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,150
She doesn't like

204
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,960
that man at all,

205
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,630
Or maybe she likes work

206
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,630
more than men.

207
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,960
Because she is

208
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,790
a kind of

209
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
strong woman,

210
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,670
People's design will collapse.

211
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,120
Listen,

212
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,910
as our

213
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,910
psychology teacher said,

214
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,390
What about ordinary people?

215
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,390
When you encounter

216
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,000
that kind of

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,320
special psychological difficulties,

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
There are often

219
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,720
five stages of reaction,

220
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,240
Which five?

221
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,750
The first denial

222
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,630
avoids the fact that

223
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,270
something has already happened

224
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,720
by diverting attention,

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,790
Second, anger

226
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
is often

227
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
a seemingly insignificant thing,

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
can be the reason for her anger.

229
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,200
The third entanglement.

230
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,670
Like my

231
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,000
roommate's ex-girlfriend,

232
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,360
It was that woman

233
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
who initiated the breakup.

234
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,510
But what happened later?

235
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,390
After they broke up,

236
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,270
they begged me

237
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,320
to be their peacemaker.

238
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Let them get back together.

239
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,030
Okay, we're back together,

240
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,000
but what's the result?

241
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,630
Two days after they got back together,

242
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,910
they broke up again.

243
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,720
She blocked my roommate again.

244
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
This woman, anyway,

245
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,670
is very tangled.

246
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,750
Let's go on to the fourth place.

247
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,390
I forgot.

248
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,790
Master, you wanted to see me,

249
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,510
Yanxi,

250
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,750
Hasn't Starlight replied yet?

251
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,550
Not yet.

252
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,390
We can't wait any longer.

253
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,320
How about this?

254
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,840
You compare everything with Starlight,

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,750
Make a list of shopping malls

256
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,840
with similar layout,

257
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,870
In the same way,

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,870
we'll contact each other separately.

259
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,870
Understood.

260
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,270
Mr. Du.

261
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,360
Are you hungry?

262
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Call Gu Qiao

263
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
and let's have dinner together.

264
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,360
I don't have time.

265
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,550
I know you've been in a bad mood lately.

266
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,080
But you still have to eat.

267
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,550
You.

268
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,200
First, denial

269
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,910
avoids the fact that

270
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,000
it has happened

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
by diverting attention.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Second, anger

273
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,630
often seems to be

274
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,720
an insignificant thing,

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,030
can be the reason for her anger.

276
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Third,

277
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,150
it's very tangled anyway.

278
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
Hello, Mr. Wu.

279
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,510
Yes, I'll be right there.

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,870
Deny it.

281
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,870
Anger,

282
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
ambivalent

283
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,960
Oh no.

284
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,550
All of them are matched.

285
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,840
What's the matter, Gu Qiao?

286
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,630
This format can't be modified.

287
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,670
Accept this.

288
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,670
Or you can refuse.

289
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,270
I tried, but it didn't work.

290
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,390
Let me take a look at it for you.

291
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,910
Okay.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,390
Do you think age and seniority

293
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,440
are the same thing?

294
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
Really?

295
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,670
What's wrong?

296
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
I'm fine.

297
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,960
All right,

298
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,440
thank you.

299
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,070
You're welcome.

300
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,480
Miss Gu Qiao,

301
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,440
if you're not familiar

302
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
with computer operation,

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,590
Leave it to me.

304
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,400
You can take these questionnaires,

305
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,880
do market research,

306
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,880
All right,

307
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,270
go for it!

308
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,110
After careful consideration,

309
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,270
we made a unanimous decision,

310
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,960
You can put the open space

311
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,790
next to the bathroom,

312
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,880
I'll set up a counter for you,

313
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,070
but the price can't be lowered.

314
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,920
Be the same as other counters,

315
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
otherwise we won't be able to explain

316
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,830
to other brands.

317
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,720
No problem.

318
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,440
One more request,

319
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,240
you and Guangke,

320
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,550
There can't be any problems.

321
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,240
Otherwise,

322
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,270
I'll be a joke

323
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
in Starlight.

324
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,070
Mr. Wu, don't worry,

325
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,270
I, Yuan Ge,

326
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,440
always keep my word.

327
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,480
Okay,

328
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll ask the legal department

329
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,960
to issue the contract as soon as possible.

330
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm racing against time.

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
Can I do it now?

332
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,030
Now,

333
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,640
Yes.

334
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,550
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

335
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
I've long heard that Mr. Yuan

336
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,640
is decisive,

337
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,590
I saw him today.

338
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,880
Hold on.

339
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,030
Have you searched all of them?

340
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,310
Didn't I ask you to stay with her

341
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,200
24 hours a day?

342
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,640
How could I get lost?

343
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay, I got it.

344
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,200
Can you do a questionnaire survey?

345
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,750
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

346
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,110
Can you do a questionnaire survey?

347
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,680
Excuse me,

348
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,510
we're going to the front.

349
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,880
Hello,

350
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,270
can you do a questionnaire survey?

351
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,110
Sorry,

352
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,030
we have to go to other places

353
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,590
to have a look.

354
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,110
Kid,

355
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,310
why are you here alone?

356
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,440
Where are your parents?

357
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Can I sit next to you?

358
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,270
These are your parents.

359
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,000
Is your name Ling Ling?

360
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,110
Alright, stop crying.

361
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,480
Ling Ling, what's wrong with you?

362
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,350
Tell me,

363
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,720
I'll help you.

364
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,640
You keep crying,

365
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,590
but I don't know

366
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,310
how to help you, do I?

367
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,030
Then.

368
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm leaving.

369
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
I'm really leaving.

370
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,480
I miss you.

371
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,310
I want to see my mom.

372
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,270
Yuan Ge,

373
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,310
Tiantai,

374
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,880
Business?

375
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,160
What business?

376
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,830
How is it? Isn't it beautiful?

377
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't tell me.

378
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,160
You've been in Shumei for so long,

379
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,110
but you haven't been here.

380
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
What exactly do you want to talk to me about?

381
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,750
I just want to take you to relax.

382
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,350
Look,

383
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,830
you've got a wider view.

384
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,750
Do you feel better now?

385
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,750
Du Bingwen,

386
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,200
just say what you want to say.

387
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,880
Don't beat around the bush,

388
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm just saying

389
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,750
what I mean.

390
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,830
Can you stop

391
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,160
making people so complicated,

392
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,160
You see,

393
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,110
the world is vast,

394
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,070
There are many choices in life,

395
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,960
more than we think.

396
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,640
There are some things,

397
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,590
you have to be persistent when you need to be persistent,

398
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,070
But there are some things

399
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
that seem precious,

400
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,030
In fact,

401
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,960
it's just a passing sight.

402
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,350
When you lose it,

403
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
you won't feel sorry for it.

404
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm just expressing my feelings.

405
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,880
I don't mean anything else.

406
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,680
Thank you.

407
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,790
For what?

408
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,200
When you first came to Shumei.

409
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,310
I really don't like

410
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,510
the way you do things,

411
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,440
But after everything I've been through,

412
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,000
I realized,

413
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,110
You do have

414
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,960
your ability.

415
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,830
So, from now on,

416
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,750
we will cooperate sincerely.

417
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,310
Let's make Shu Mei

418
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
better together.

419
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,640
Can you stop saying that

420
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
you can't live without work.

421
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,030
Can we talk about something else?

422
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,790
What do you want to talk about?

423
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,590
I want to talk.

424
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,590
Look,

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,480
look at the sunset,

426
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
What does it look like?

427
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,960
In my eyes,

428
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,590
it's like a salted egg yolk,

429
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
When I eat meat dumplings and moon cakes,

430
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,550
I have to have salted egg yolks,

431
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,070
What about you?

432
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,790
I don't like salted egg yolks,

433
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,680
so I don't like them either.

434
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,880
Miss Gu,

435
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,400
thanks to you today.

436
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,200
I also happened to meet Ling Ling,

437
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,880
Ling Ling doesn't usually

438
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,310
talk to strangers,

439
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,790
I didn't expect that

440
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
I would give you my number.

441
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,680
We've met before,

442
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,240
so it's kind of fate.

443
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,030
By the way,

444
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,550
the last time you came to the company to see me,

445
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,440
Please forgive me

446
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,440
for being rude.

447
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,640
If you need any help,

448
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,510
just let me know.

449
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,920
I will do my best to help you.

450
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,830
If there's nothing else,

451
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,790
you can stay with Ling Ling.

452
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,640
I'll get going.

453
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Goodbye

454
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,000
Amazing.

455
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,030
As far as I know,

456
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,200
there are no expired counters

457
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,110
in Shanghai recently,

458
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,400
Mr. Yuan,

459
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,310
in such a short time,

460
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,200
I was really surprised

461
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,550
to get Starlight's entry contract.

462
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,110
How did you do that?

463
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,510
It all depends on human effort.

464
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
The contract can't be fake anyway.

465
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,550
On my side,

466
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,750
as long as the counter is designed,

467
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,070
You can settle in anytime.

468
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,310
Then we can

469
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,070
move forward

470
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,160
with our cooperation.

471
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,640
Of course.

472
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,590
I told you about my situation,

473
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,510
time is running out,

474
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,070
So I drew up

475
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,240
a cooperation contract first,

476
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,880
The specific requirements and conditions

477
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,000
are in the terms,

478
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,350
I've shown enough sincerity.

479
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,310
Next,

480
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,680
it depends on the sincerity of Guangke.

481
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,110
Mr. Yuan,

482
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,200
the delivery time of some resources

483
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
may change temporarily.

484
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,160
It's not good to

485
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,480
put a specific date in the contract,

486
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
We're racing against time

487
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,830
to do this. We have to

488
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,200
make it clear in black and white.

489
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,720
How about this?

490
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
I'll take you to see Mr. Xiong.

491
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,480
If you can convince him,

492
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm sure there will be no problem.

493
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,550
Okay.

494
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,720
Where's Mr. Xiong?

495
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I'm on a business trip.

496
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,070
When will you be back?

497
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,070
It'll take a week at the earliest.

498
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,400
A week?

499
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,350
Where is he going?

500
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,270
I'm going abroad anyway,

501
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,590
so I'm not sure about the details.

502
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,270
Mr. Yuan,

503
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,480
let me go back to your company

504
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,160
and explain the situation

505
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,350
to your boss.

506
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,110
Can you tell me

507
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,510
Mr. Xiong's flight number?

508
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm sorry,

509
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,830
because it's a temporary trip,

510
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,270
So I'm not sure.

511
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,400
Shirley

512
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
Hello, Ge Ge, where are you?

513
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm starving.

514
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
Didn't you say you'd come back for dinner

515
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,880
after signing the contract?

516
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,030
You can eat it yourself.

517
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
Something came up,

518
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,830
and I'm on my way to the airport, right?

519
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,200
Why are you going to the airport?

520
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,160
Xiong Qiming, the boss of Guangke,

521
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,550
suddenly went abroad for something.

522
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,480
He won't be back

523
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,270
until a week later.

524
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,240
Without his approval,

525
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,350
the contract can't be signed

526
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,960
for a week,

527
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,240
Isn't the one-month period

528
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,920
between you and Mr. Fu over?

529
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,400
I wish I knew

530
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,880
his flight number now.

531
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,960
Forget it. I'm driving.

532
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,830
I'll hang up now.

533
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,480
Okay. Don't worry. Be careful.

534
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,030
Goodbye, Miss Gu.

535
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,200
Hello, Ge Ge, Xiong Qiming is leaving for New York at 4:

536
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,750
00,

537
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,070
I'll find a way to stall him for you.

538
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Keep up the good work.

539
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,680
Goodbye.

540
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,350
Sir,

541
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,750
could you please drive faster?

542
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,070
How can it be faster?

543
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,510
We can't fly either.

544
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,640
Attention, passengers on flight 7381

545
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,750
to Beijing,

546
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,790
Mr. Xiong,

547
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,270
sorry to bother you.

548
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,200
A lady named Gu Qiao

549
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
contacted our customer service and said,

550
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,880
She's your family.

551
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,830
I need to talk to you urgently,

552
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,240
but I couldn't reach you.

553
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,240
But she's

554
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
on her way.

555
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,200
I hope you can wait for her.

556
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,790
I got it.

557
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay.

558
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,790
Ge Ge, where are you?

559
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,790
I'm at the airport.

560
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm stuck in a traffic jam,

561
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,400
so I think it'll take a while.

562
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,350
Okay. Take your time.

563
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,750
Don't worry.

564
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,880
I'll stall him for you.

565
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,880
Thank you.

566
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,550
Goodbye.

567
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,030
Miss Gu,

568
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
tell me,

569
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,480
You're my family.

570
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,750
She … She must have made a mistake.

571
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,510
Why would I say

572
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,790
it's your family?

573
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,720
I came to see you today,

574
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,960
because of Ling Ling.

575
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,480
Didn't you say

576
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,350
Ling Ling is introverted,

577
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,590
Don't you like to talk?

578
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,270
When I was little,

579
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,030
No.

580
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah. When I was little,

581
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
my friend was also very introverted.

582
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,830
But because,

583
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,000
because of her mother's death,

584
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,750
So,

585
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,550
that's how she is.

586
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,110
When I was little, my classmates said

587
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,550
she was a strange Miss Gu.

588
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,550
You came to meet me

589
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,960
at the airport in such a hurry.

590
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,880
That's why you want to tell me.

591
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,830
Actually, what I want to say is,

592
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,310
at Ling Ling's age,

593
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,640
In fact, I really need

594
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,000
the company of others,

595
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,590
But as busy as you are every day,

596
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,830
flying around,

597
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,680
I don't have much time for her.

598
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Miss Gu,

599
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,880
thank you for reminding me.

600
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,880
I'll spend some time with Ling Ling.

601
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,590
But

602
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
I'm really in a hurry now,

603
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
so let's talk about it

604
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,070
when we get back.

605
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,070
Mr. Xiong.

606
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,880
My shoelaces are untied.

607
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,550
Thank you.

608
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,510
Have some water.

609
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,400
I'm not thirsty.

610
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,680
Mr. Xiong,

611
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,550
Miss Gu,

612
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,750
What's the matter with you?

613
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,680
Actually, I'm here

614
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,400
for work,

615
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,960
You want me to introduce you to a job?

616
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,920
No, no.

617
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,880
Or for money?

618
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
Not really.

619
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,790
Miss Gu,

620
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,750
if it's not urgent,

621
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,960
Let's talk about it when I'm back.

622
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm going to board the plane now.

623
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,270
Okay?

624
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,480
Bear

625
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,160
Ge Ge,

626
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,510
Go after him

627
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,270
As for this matter,

628
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,440
it's up to you to handle it yourself.

629
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,960
That's it.

630
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,790
I've told Xueli, you can talk to her this afternoon

631
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,590
about the matters

632
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,790
related to Li Juncheng after the contract,

633
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,200
She will do it herself.

634
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,720
Thank you so much, Mr. Xiong.

635
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,550
I wish you all the best.

636
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,270
-See you later. -See

637
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,160
you later.

638
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm here.

639
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,150
How did you

640
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,190
and Xiong Qiming meet?

641
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,280
I don't think

642
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,000
I've mentioned anything about him

643
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,320
to you before, have I?

644
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,510
Even his secretary doesn't know.

645
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,920
About his private schedule,

646
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,230
how did you find out about it?

647
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,030
It doesn't matter how I found out.

648
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,480
It's important that we enjoy

649
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,760
our highlights,

650
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,190
Everything else is just a small matter.

651
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,670
Let's touch it.

652
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,880
Don't drink too much.

653
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,840
Maybe you're right,

654
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,000
There are some things

655
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,400
that need to be humane.

656
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,760
If it weren't for you,

657
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,960
I might not have had a chance

658
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,070
to see Xiong Qiming.

659
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,400
Don't be polite to me.

660
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,840
Hope

661
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
We will be better and better in the future.

662
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,110
We will get better and better.

663
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,590
But I feel like,

664
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,630
I have to work hard to make money now,

665
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,230
You should take good care of yourself,

666
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,320
and solve

667
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,440
your life-long problem.

668
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,280
Do you know that?

669
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,070
Every time I hear you say that,

670
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,880
I feel like,

671
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,360
You're like my mother,

672
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,190
a good daughter,

673
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
Find me a good son-in-law,

674
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,590
Du Erer. How's it going?

675
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,150
It doesn't matter how Second Brother Du is,

676
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,440
it's enough to have you as his best friend.

677
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,880
I like to hear that.

678
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,400
Cheers!

679
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,280
Cheers!

680
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,320
Where's the contract of Guangke?

681
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,590
Mr. Yuan, it's all over.

682
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,230
I'll follow up on the follow-up work.

683
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,760
Look,

684
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
do you have anything else to tell me?

685
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,000
With you connecting with them,

686
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,960
I can rest assured.

687
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,710
As for this cooperation,

688
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,880
it's all Mr. Yuan's credit.

689
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,630
I'm just taking care

690
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,000
of the scraps,

691
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,510
Don't get me wrong.

692
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,630
I'm stingy with Ge Zi's praise.

693
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,230
Because when she does things,

694
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,070
she never lets me down.

695
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,440
Recently, everyone

696
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,590
has been working hard.

697
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,320
Why don't we

698
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
finish our work for a few days,

699
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,590
You set up a team building.

700
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,070
Let's have fun together.

701
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,590
Okay.

702
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,440
What do you want to play?

703
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,360
Master, you wanted to see me?

704
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,630
Come in.

705
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,630
It's nothing serious.

706
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,800
Just to let you know,

707
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,070
the matter of Guangke has been solved,

708
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,030
Mr. Du

709
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,440
He said he wouldn't hold you accountable.

710
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,110
Yanxi,

711
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,360
I brought you out.

712
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,630
I hope that in the future,

713
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,190
you can think carefully,

714
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,440
Don't make mistakes

715
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,510
like this again.

716
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,760
I got it.

717
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Thank you, Master.

718
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,880
You don't need to thank me.

719
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Thank Gu Qiao.

720
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,280
She helped me a lot

721
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,440
with the matter of Guangke.

722
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,070
Gu Qiao,

723
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,760
go ahead.

724
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,590
Okay.

725
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,670
Gu Qiao,

726
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,480
Morning,

727
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,840
Where did you go yesterday?

728
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,030
Exactly

729
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,510
You ask for leave every three days.

730
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,070
You don't look like a newcomer at all.

731
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,150
I had something to do yesterday,

732
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,030
but I was so kind

733
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,840
to mention it before

734
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,550
that you just put it in vain.

735
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,510
It's hard for you to get a full-time job.

736
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,320
Manager Zheng is your leader.

737
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,550
You didn't even say hello.

738
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,760
She just left.

739
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,670
Are you bullying her?

740
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,800
Is she younger than you?

741
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,550
I asked her for leave.

742
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,880
Manager Zheng,

743
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,510
she said she asked you for leave.

744
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,110
Really?

745
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,760
Did you?

746
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,150
Why are you still lying?

747
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,880
I called you but you didn't answer,

748
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,360
so I sent you a WeChat message.

749
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,150
My phone is broken these days.

750
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,030
I didn't receive it. Sorry.

751
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,880
Let me help you.

752
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,710
Thank you.

753
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,030
Where should I put this?

754
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,630
Just put it in the printing room in front.

755
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,150
Okay,

756
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,360
Are you new here?

757
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,550
Yes, my name is Hao Shuai.

758
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,590
I'm a new intern.

759
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,030
My name is Gu Qiao,

760
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,150
Gu Qiao,

761
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,800
You … How old are you? Just call me sister.

762
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,920
I was born in 2001,

763
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,710
so I should call her sister.

764
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
You came out to work at such a young age.

765
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,440
He's not young anymore.

766
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,280
To Gu Qiao,

767
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
do you know where Zheng Yanxi

768
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,150
and Manager Zheng are?

769
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,590
That's her work station.

770
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
She's not here,

771
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,150
I'll take you there

772
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,000
to find her later.

773
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,630
Okay,

774
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,400
Well,

775
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,440
Here,

776
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,070
Okay,

777
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,800
Thank you.

778
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,480
I'm fine.

779
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,070
Your name is Hao Shuai?

780
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,550
Yes.

781
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,400
When I was born,

782
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,070
my dad thought,

783
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,070
I didn't ask you

784
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,440
about this appointment. When will you report for duty?

785
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,840
I was a little late at 9: 00. It's already

786
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,630
11: 00.

787
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,590
You're two hours late.

788
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,360
Is it for a while?

789
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,360
I played the game too late yesterday.

790
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,670
And then I couldn't get up in the morning,

791
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,590
so I was late.

792
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,710
You're quite honest.

793
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,880
I'm just honest, reliable and stylish.

794
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,070
Okay,

795
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,880
For the sake of your honesty,

796
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,670
it's your first day at work,

797
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,510
I won't give you a hard time.

798
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,590
It won't happen again.

799
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,030
Okay, Yancy,

800
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,000
come with me.

801
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay.

802
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,320
After that, sit here.

803
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,070
Okay,

804
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,230
Hello.

805
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,030
That boy is so handsome.

806
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,280
There hasn't been a boy in our company

807
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,510
for a long time.

808
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,480
And he's so handsome.

809
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm going to treat Sister Wang to milk tea,

810
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,800
but I can't believe

811
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,360
I've assigned

812
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,070
such a good-looking intern to our department,

813
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,960
You like it?

814
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,070
I like it too.

815
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,510
Hello, I'm Wang Mei.

816
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,630
My name is Xia Meng.

817
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,960
Hello.

818
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,920
Sweet dreams.

819
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,150
Give him to me.

820
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:36,920
No, I won't.

821
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,190
We have to compete fairly.

822
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,400
This bag.

823
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,190
He's yours now.
