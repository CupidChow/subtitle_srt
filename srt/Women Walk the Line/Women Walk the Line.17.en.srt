1
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,079
What are you doing, brother?

2
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,400
Can't you see what I'm doing?

3
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,519
Let me ask you something.

4
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,560
The boss of Guangke

5
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,760
is Xiong Qiming,

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,879
What is he like?

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,799
He's quite tall.

8
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,560
What's wrong?

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,159
No.

10
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm just asking.

11
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,560
He pretended to be decent

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
when he came to our company last time.

13
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,680
He's really that good.

14
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way,

15
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,199
his child,

16
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,759
The tutor is Gu Qiao,

17
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,960
Gu Qiao is so busy,

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,879
She can also be a tutor?

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You … Play with me for a while.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
I need to go to the toilet.

22
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,919
Hey,

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,280
Hello,

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,599
are you Mr. Xiong Qiming?

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,080
Yes.

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,120
Who are you?

27
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm Gu Qiao's boyfriend.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,879
There's something

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,719
I want to ask you in person,

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Okay.

31
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,560
Tomorrow at 3: 00 p. m., I'll see you at the coffee shop downstairs.

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,719
Shumei

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,439
Okay.

34
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,919
Ge Ge,

35
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,560
why are you here?

36
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
Why are you here?

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,960
There are so many libraries in Shanghai,

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,400
why did you come here?

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,080
This house is the closest to home,

40
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,759
where can I come if I don't come here?

41
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,040
But you,

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,759
why did you come to the library early in the morning?

43
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm fine.

44
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,560
Come out and read a book.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
I was wrong.

46
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
What did you do wrong?

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,399
We've known each other for so many years,

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,759
what do I think?

49
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,800
How could you not know?

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I admit it.

51
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,800
What about you,

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
I hate that iron can't be made into steel.

53
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,959
But that's the family,

54
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,279
the harshness towards the family,

55
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,759
The reason why I'm in such a hurry,

56
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,720
is because I hope,

57
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
You can improve quickly.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
Because I've never

59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,959
disliked you.

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
And I won't believe you.

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,680
I hope you can really do it

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,439
more than anyone else.

63
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,839
Now you trust me?

64
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,600
When did I not believe you?

65
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,240
Silly girl.

66
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,279
But you're still being mean to me.

67
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,199
Is it true that you made a mistake?

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,759
When someone bullied you at the dinner party last time,

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,439
I can stand up for you in public.

70
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,839
If you make a mistake this time,

71
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,240
I can criticize you in public.

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,959
In the future, in the company,

73
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,560
others will look at you

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,439
with a normal heart,

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,279
Am I right?

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
That's all for now.

77
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,800
Why is it like this?

78
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,519
Are you unwilling to forgive me?

79
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,120
Am I

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
that stingy?

81
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course not.

82
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,879
Gu Qiao is the most generous,

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
and he even bought me books.

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,240
Du Bingwen asked you

85
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,519
to give a lecture on Li Juncheng's knowledge.

86
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,560
Although I'm still busy this week,

87
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,240
I'm willing to be busy.

88
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,000
Give me some time.

89
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,079
I can handle it myself.

90
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,759
Really?

91
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,639
That's great.

92
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,639
I'll go home then.

93
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,720
No, no, no.

94
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm just saying this,

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,920
but you just listen to it.

96
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Give it to me.

97
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,480
Actually, I've made

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,399
the big framework.

99
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,720
It's just some details.

100
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,879
I'm not sure yet.

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm not sure

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,199
about

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,399
this part.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,120
Let me

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,439
take a look at this part.

106
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,199
What's in front of and behind you?

107
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,720
Mr. Hao is

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,639
Miss Gu's colleague,

109
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,679
Gu Qiao and I are in an underground relationship,

110
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,440
but we haven't made it public.

111
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,360
You just graduated from college.

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,399
What are you doing in Shu Mei?

113
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,919
Intern,

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,720
Wait.

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm looking for you.

116
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,879
I'm not asking you to interrogate me.

117
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,399
Today,

118
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,720
I have something to tell you.

119
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,360
Mr. Hao, it doesn't matter if you say it.

120
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,200
Gu Qiao and I love each other,

121
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,279
as you know,

122
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,240
Nowadays, all women in the workplace

123
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
like handsome guys.

124
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,240
That's me,

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Sunshine Handsome,

126
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,360
You're funny

127
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,519
and energetic.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,960
Mr. Hao,

129
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,679
come straight to the point.

130
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,600
Okay,

131
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,279
Anyway, what I'm saying

132
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
is that I want to tell you,

133
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,000
You'd better stay away from Gu Qiao.

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
Does Miss Gu know you're doing this?

135
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,120
She'll let you interfere with her.

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,360
The freedom to make friends,

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,039
she doesn't need to know.

138
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm in charge of our affairs.

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,840
Aren't you supposed to

140
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,960
listen to your sister?

141
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,639
As far as I know,

142
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,320
Miss Gu is still single.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
What do you mean?

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,080
What do you think of her?

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't have to report to you.

146
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,519
Even if there is,

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
we can still compete fairly.

148
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,480
Competing,

149
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,159
You admit that you like Gu Qiao?

150
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,000
Is there a problem?

151
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
Coffee is on me.

152
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,759
What is this?

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,960
This is,

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,879
you can see here that

155
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,080
the writing on this page

156
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,360
is the same as this page.

157
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,919
Hey,

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Where are you?

159
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,159
I'm outside.

160
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,360
Outside,

161
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,080
with Gu Qiao,

162
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,480
That's right.

163
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,519
The two of us are together,

164
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,519
Second Brother Du,

165
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,279
We've made up.

166
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,279
All right,

167
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,039
good news.

168
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,240
Let me treat you two to dinner tonight

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
to celebrate.

170
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,320
Where are you going?

171
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,679
I'll send you the location later.

172
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay.

173
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,840
See you later.

174
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,759
See you later.

175
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,360
Du Bingwen said.

176
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,919
When he invited us to dinner tonight,

177
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,000
he obviously wanted to invite you to dinner,

178
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,360
You two are going on a date,

179
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm not going.

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
I don't want to be a third wheel.

181
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
I won't go if you don't go.

182
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,480
I said,

183
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,399
are you willing to give up?

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,320
You have to eat more.

185
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,720
Look at how thin you've been lately.

186
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,279
Don't show off your love

187
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,799
in front of me.

188
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,879
If you keep doing this,

189
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,639
I'll leave.

190
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,879
You can leave now.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,960
The more you act like this,

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
the more I want to stay.

193
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
Come on, Gu Qiao.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,320
Thank you, Ge Ge.

195
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,399
Are you done?

196
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,159
You don't have hands, do you?

197
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,480
Good for you,

198
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Bingwen. You're a two-timer,

199
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You're quite moist.

200
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,919
What do kids know?

201
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
You talk so sour.

202
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
Sit down and eat.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
What are you doing?

204
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,919
No,

205
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,759
let go of me.

206
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,000
What are you doing?

207
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,440
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,279
Hao Shuai has grown up.

209
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,320
I know how to create space for my brother.

210
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,240
What's wrong with them?

211
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
What are you doing?

212
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,639
Let go of me!

213
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,159
Gu Qiao,

214
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
let me remind you,

215
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,559
Stay away from Xiong Qiming.

216
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,120
He's not a good guy.

217
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,159
Listen to me.

218
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,320
Quit your tutor.

219
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,480
Aren't you short of money?

220
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,840
You want me to earn it for you?

221
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,720
Brother,

222
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,240
I said you just drank a drink,

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,840
It's not wine. What nonsense

224
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,600
are you talking about here?

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Don't laugh.

226
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm serious.

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay,

228
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,200
Tell me

229
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,679
Think about it yourself.

230
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,919
He's so rich,

231
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,519
why doesn't he

232
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,600
find a professional tutor,

233
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,879
If I have to look for an amateur like you,

234
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,399
he'll be drunk instead of drinking.

235
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,279
Uneasy and kind.

236
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,799
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

237
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,279
Before I met Xiong Qiming,

238
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,320
I knew his daughter.

239
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,519
There are a lot of coincidences,

240
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,399
which you don't know.

241
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,240
What coincidence?

242
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
It was premeditated.

243
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:01,960
If it weren't

244
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,000
for your brother's sake,

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
I'll beat you up.

246
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,000
Believe me,

247
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,200
he admitted it himself,

248
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
He just has feelings for you.

249
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,639
You went to see Xiong Qiming.

250
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,720
That's right.

251
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,159
I have to meet him.

252
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:16,879
I can't let you get cheated

253
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,639
when you get married,

254
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,679
You must be fooled by your second marriage.

255
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,120
Are you crazy?

256
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
What's going on?

257
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,480
Me

258
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Why don't I let you

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
eat lunch at home?

260
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Go after her.

261
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
I'll get the car.

262
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,720
Gu Qiao,

263
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,559
sorry,

264
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,039
Gu Qiao, wait.

265
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,000
Gu Qiao,

266
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,960
you didn't understand

267
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,799
what I meant just now,

268
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,879
Gu Qiao, wait.

269
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,559
Gu Qiao,

270
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,799
listen to me,

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay,

272
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,240
I'll tell you one more time,

273
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Hao Shuai,

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
I've always regarded you as my younger brother.

275
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
Don't complicate the relationship.

276
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,000
And Xiong Qiming and I,

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,480
nothing happened.

278
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,799
Don't disturb others.

279
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,919
Then tell me,

280
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,080
what kind of man do you like?

281
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,039
What kind of man do I like?

282
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,120
What does it have to do with you?

283
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,919
Besides, I don't want to

284
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,759
think about it now.

285
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,080
All I want to do now is to make money

286
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,960
and pay off 2 million yuan.

287
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,960
Will you be with

288
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,559
Xiong Qiming for money?

289
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,799
I might not marry a rich man.

290
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,919
But I know,

291
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,159
I won't marry a kid

292
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,799
who hasn't graduated yet,

293
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Do you understand what I said?

294
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,720
I didn't expect you

295
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
to be such a realistic person,

296
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,399
Yes.

297
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,879
That's how realistic I am.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
So don't follow me anymore.

299
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,960
You have nothing to ask me.

300
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,240
No.

301
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,279
I believe you can handle

302
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,440
all these things well.

303
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,480
Do you really believe me?

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,679
Mr. Xiong,

305
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
sorry,

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,039
I heard that my colleague Hao Shuai

307
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,799
went to see you.

308
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,160
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

309
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,680
Where is it?

310
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,240
We're at this point.

311
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,559
Here,

312
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,359
should we

313
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,440
look for a blue one,

314
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,480
Blue,

315
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,319
Blue,

316
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,200
And then find a yellow one.

317
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,160
Let's look for it.

318
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Where is it?

319
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,319
Miss Gu is here.

320
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,079
Yellow.

321
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,519
I knew Hao Shuai made it up,

322
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,119
but fortunately I deleted that message.

323
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,319
Did you find it?

324
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,279
Found one,

325
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,759
two,

326
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,680
Where is the brown one?

327
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,119
-Is it in

328
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
this? -No.

329
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:04,880
Miss Gu,

330
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,960
have a cup of tea.

331
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,640
Thank you.

332
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,440
Dad,

333
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,799
I want some tea, too.

334
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
Children are not allowed to drink tea.

335
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,079
No, I want to drink it.

336
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,359
It's so bitter for you

337
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
to drink my tea.

338
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,279
That's right.

339
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,279
Then why do adults

340
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,799
like to drink tea.

341
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,240
Because adults think

342
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,119
life is hard,

343
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,480
If you take a sip of bitter tea,

344
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
life won't be so bitter.

345
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,359
I see.

346
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,400
Sister,

347
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,359
Sister,

348
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,920
Do you think my spelling is right?

349
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,039
That's right.

350
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,920
So smart.

351
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,440
Miss Gu,

352
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,319
what's on your mind?

353
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,680
Actually, it's nothing.

354
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,839
Some people in the company don't like me,

355
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
and think I got in through connections,

356
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,160
That's why you always wear shoes for me.

357
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Dig a hole for me.

358
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,519
Actually, in my opinion,

359
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,200
networking itself is a kind of strength,

360
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:32,880
A smart and capable woman

361
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,319
like Mr. Yuan,

362
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,480
I can see you as my bosom friend.

363
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,240
Well

364
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,079
It's enough to show your value.

365
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,359
Remember,

366
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,279
make good use of your connections.

367
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,799
When one day you break the cocoon and become a butterfly,

368
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,799
no one will remember it.

369
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,279
You used to be a caterpillar.

370
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,279
Thank you, Mr. Xiong,

371
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,440
for comforting you.

372
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,799
Okay,

373
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,119
Did you find it?

374
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,079
No.

375
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,160
We haven't found him yet.

376
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,119
By the way, where are you going?

377
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,759
Miss Gu,

378
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,680
if you're free tonight,

379
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,559
Stay for dinner.

380
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,119
I still have some work to do.

381
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,720
Maybe another day.

382
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:09,680
Okay,

383
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,680
Alright then.

384
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,079
This is the one down there.

385
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,680
There are only

386
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,359
two blue dots here.

387
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,640
Good morning, Gu Qiao,

388
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,079
Morning.

389
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,400
Everyone,

390
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,960
at 10: 30, I'll give you the brand training of Li

391
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,359
Meng,

392
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,400
Specifically,

393
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,960
I've sent it

394
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,000
to the company's email address.

395
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,039
You can have a look,

396
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,640
I hope you can arrange

397
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,599
the work at hand,

398
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,000
Try to get everyone involved.

399
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,839
Thank you.

400
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
With this aura,

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,799
which brand director

402
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,000
do you think he is?

403
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,519
What kind of assistant do you look like?

404
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
Don't be jealous

405
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,079
with her.

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,920
For a kid,

407
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,359
it's not worth it.

408
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,200
Master, you wanted to see me?

409
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,799
As for Shumei's advertising resources,

410
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,759
I heard that Gu Qiao

411
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,039
has revised it again.

412
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,720
Is there any problem?

413
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
I don't think so.

414
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,720
No

415
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,359
Brand and market are integrated.

416
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,359
We are all doing things for Shumei.

417
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,759
What's the problem?

418
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,200
You must communicate clearly in advance.

419
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,400
What happened last time,

420
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,880
I don't want it to happen again.

421
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,000
Master,

422
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,119
I really didn't.

423
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,680
All right,

424
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,079
you've called me Master for three years.

425
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:47,799
I don't know either.

426
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,880
What can I teach you?

427
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
But today I want to tell you,

428
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,720
don't blindly compare yourself with others.

429
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Be a man and do things,

430
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,039
but be worthy of your heart.

431
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:01,960
All right,

432
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,960
go back to your work.

433
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,720
I know all of you here,

434
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,880
you've been working in Shumei

435
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,759
for longer than me.

436
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,440
It's training,

437
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,519
but it's actually to help you consolidate

438
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,079
Li Meng's brand culture,

439
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
Make the best preparation

440
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
for Li Juncheng's listing.

441
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,880
Let's get started.

442
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,200
Okay,

443
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
First of all, let's talk about

444
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Li Meng's brand story,

445
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,799
It's actually

446
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,160
a Swiss skin care brand,

447
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,640
We all know that.

448
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
In fact, Switzerland's skin care brands

449
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,079
will be used

450
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,519
by many celebrities.

451
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,039
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Fu is looking for you.

452
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,559
I see.

453
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,599
It contains pure water from the Alps.

454
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,440
So?

455
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
Its anti-aging effect

456
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,200
is very good.

457
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,359
It's also

458
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,000
our main product.

459
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:25,960
Ge Zi,

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,640
come here.

461
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,119
Mr. Fu,

462
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,160
what can I do for you?

463
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
You tell me,

464
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,119
Sit down

465
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Yahya is particularly optimistic about the Chinese market

466
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,759
and is prepared to target Chinese users,

467
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,440
And set up a high-end brand.

468
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
Is the information accurate?

469
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,279
Since I was a kid in Yahua,

470
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,359
they've started to lay it out.

471
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,160
As for the acquisition of Li Junmei by Shumei,

472
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,799
Yaqin must have heard about it,

473
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,519
In this situation,

474
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,319
they still decided to enter China.

475
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,039
It must be fierce.

476
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,279
But in terms of popularity and resources,

477
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,720
we and Yahyun,

478
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
There's no comparison at all.

479
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,079
Mr. Fu,

480
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,279
we have to deal with it.

481
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,759
I think we should increase the proportion of Li Juncheng

482
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,920
and the domestic market

483
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,039
and the advertising investment.

484
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,720
Actually, I'm not too worried

485
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,519
about the commercial.

486
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,960
The optical department has always been in charge of it.

487
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,960
But the problem is,

488
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,279
we only have one

489
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,480
offline store.

490
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,799
The original plan was to increase the number to 10

491
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,000
within a year,

492
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,119
It seems necessary now.

493
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,200
One more time.

494
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
Open 10 stores in advance in a short time.

495
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,000
Mr. Fu,

496
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
actually, ten

497
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,000
is not enough.

498
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,680
We have to make sure,

499
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,319
at least until Yahyun

500
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,480
enters China,

501
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,759
In every first-tier city,

502
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,920
and quasi-first-tier cities,

503
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
You can see the store of Li's Mansion.

504
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,599
Mr. Fu,

505
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,839
the biggest problem

506
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,759
we're facing right now

507
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,960
is that we're pressed for time,

508
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440
Because once Yahyun decides

509
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,240
to work for that advertising company

510
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,240
in China,

511
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,440
Optics must be the first choice.

512
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,240
If they have reached a cooperation,

513
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,839
it will be a heavy blow to Li Meng.

514
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,480
Let me think about it.

515
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,839
Next,

516
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,559
what we talked about,

517
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,119
It's our brand design.

518
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,720
What's going on?

519
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
If you're not well prepared,

520
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
you might as well dismiss the meeting.

521
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,000
Gu Qiao didn't

522
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,160
make the presentation herself.

523
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Forget it yourself.

524
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,240
People are nervous. It's normal

525
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,319
that they don't remember.

526
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,079
For all luxuries,

527
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,680
the design process and details

528
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,599
will be emphasized very much.

529
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,319
In summary,

530
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,599
it is not difficult to find that,

531
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,640
All luxury goods

532
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,799
care about three things very much,

533
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
The first product design,

534
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,880
the second manufacturing process,

535
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,359
The third detail,

536
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,640
this detail,

537
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
Not only the product itself,

538
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,599
but also

539
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,559
our service level,

540
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,200
I hope to pass

541
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,039
today's training,

542
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,640
You can have a better understanding

543
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,839
of Li Meng's brand positioning,

544
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,559
In the future,

545
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,359
I hope you can

546
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,640
do your best,

547
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
To serve our customers.

548
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,480
Let's take a ten-minute break.

549
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,920
We'll talk later.

550
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,680
Now you don't even

551
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,519
do superficial skills anymore.

552
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,160
Is that necessary?

553
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,839
You're right.

554
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,119
I joined the company because of your master

555
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,119
and transferred my post because of your master,

556
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,279
You did a good job in this presentation,

557
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,599
because of your master,

558
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,319
But your master

559
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,480
is willing to be nice to me.

560
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,559
What else can we do?

561
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,920
Come on.

562
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,279
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

563
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm here.

564
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,079
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

565
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,519
Brother,

566
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,079
You're back.

567
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,279
It's my treat today.

568
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,119
Take-out will arrive later

569
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,559
Let's go Let's go

570
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,240
Come with me.

571
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,160
I'll show you the score.

572
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,839
If you play games so well,

573
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,039
you can play professionally in the future.

574
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Professional?

575
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,079
No, no, no.

576
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm too old to play professionally

577
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
at my age.

578
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,960
You can do whatever you want

579
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,359
in the future.

580
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,960
What?

581
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,960
Why do you ask?

582
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,920
Such a serious question.

583
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,599
Did you quarrel with your sister-in-law again?

584
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,000
Your school sent me an email.

585
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,359
I sent it to you first.

586
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,240
You didn't reply.

587
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
So you found me.

588
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,400
Good for you.

589
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,039
Being dropped out of school is such a big thing,

590
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,079
how dare you hide it from me

591
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,880
Me,

592
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,359
I wanted to say it before,

593
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,839
but I didn't have a chance.

594
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,240
I have a chance now.

595
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,359
Tell me.

596
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,160
What's going on?

597
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,640
Anyway, I was wronged,

598
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,319
and other clubs in our school,

599
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,680
He always bullies us.

600
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,440
We finally formed

601
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:50,920
a

602
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Panda Warrior Interest Alliance,

603
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,240
So they came to the scene on purpose.

604
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,920
Smash the field and make trouble,

605
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,759
and then hit people.

606
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,240
Then I'll,

607
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,680
Well,

608
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,119
Just one punch.

609
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,319
I didn't know he was admitted to the hospital.

610
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,240
Just one punch.

611
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,240
Sure.

612
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,279
Pretty good.

613
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,920
Since you were wronged,

614
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,680
why did you accept the punishment

615
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,640
without saying a word.

616
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,799
What's the use of telling me?

617
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,039
The school won't believe me.

618
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,759
Don't worry about

619
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
it. The school believes you now.

620
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,160
Ask you to go back to school,

621
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I'll buy you a plane ticket,

622
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:35,559
Go back.

623
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,359
It's good.

624
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,640
Go to the company

625
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
and quit your job tomorrow.

626
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,440
Where are you going to say goodbye to your friend?

627
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,519
Say goodbye.

628
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,880
After you go back, study hard,

629
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,519
and come back to serve your country.

630
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,519
I'm not going back.

631
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,680
What's the use of me

632
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,519
going back to a school like that?

633
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,519
What can it teach me?

634
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,920
What can you do if you don't go back?

635
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,319
College degree,

636
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,359
high school diploma,

637
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,079
What kind of job

638
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,119
do you think you can find?

639
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,319
Alright,

640
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,319
let's go back.

641
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,920
Just do it for your parents.

642
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,559
Have they thought about it for me?

643
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,200
I don't want to go abroad at all.

644
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,759
Is studying abroad

645
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,759
the only way to make a difference?

646
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,640
Of course, studying abroad

647
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
is not the only way to make a difference.

648
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
If you can get into a domestic school,

649
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,119
you won't be allowed to go abroad.

650
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,759
I won't go back.

651
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,839
Where are you going?

652
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,200
Hao Shuai,

653
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
where are you?

654
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,480
Can you talk to me?

655
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,039
I'm in the office.

656
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,559
Interns waste the company's resources

657
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,839
and neglect verbal education,

658
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,920
Or you'll be fired.

659
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,400
You know what?

660
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,079
Sis, you're finally here.

661
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,119
I'm starving.

662
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
Now that you're hungry,

663
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,079
what did you do just now?

664
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,720
Sis, do you want some?

665
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,599
Go ahead.

666
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,119
Okay.

667
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,599
Thank you.

668
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,880
Hao Shuai,

669
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,119
can you tell me,

670
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,800
Why don't you want to go back to school?

671
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,599
Are you here to help my brother?

672
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,159
I'm just curious.

673
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,079
What do you think?

674
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,079
Did he tell you,

675
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,880
Why did my school

676
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,719
let me go back to school?

677
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,519
He said it was because

678
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,519
you hurt your classmate

679
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,599
at school,

680
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,320
Later, they found out that

681
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
you acted in self-defense.

682
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,800
They've been looking into it for a long time.

683
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,840
But before,

684
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,599
I was a nobody,

685
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,760
They don't care at all.

686
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,079
Now,

687
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,480
we Panda Hero Interest League,

688
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,639
After winning a grand prize internationally,

689
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,000
he can't see me as the leader of the Alliance.

690
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,639
You were dropped out of school for no reason, right?

691
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,239
So I didn't go back on purpose.

692
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,360
I want to see

693
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,400
how they hit themselves in the face?

694
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,880
What is

695
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
the Panda Warrior Interest League

696
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,679
you mentioned just now?

697
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,239
This alliance

698
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,039
is an interest group

699
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:11,920
that I set up,

700
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,199
What's our purpose?

701
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
is to gather people

702
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,719
who love Chinese traditional culture,

703
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,440
Call on everyone to promote traditional culture,

704
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,679
and let those foreigners know,

705
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,000
What's the cultural achievement

706
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,559
of Chinese 5thousand year?

707
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,840
Awesome, right?

708
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,480
Great.

709
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,079
Your idea

710
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,239
is indeed very good.

711
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,000
Really?

712
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,920
You didn't coax me, did you?

713
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,039
Do I look like

714
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,719
someone who can cajole people?

715
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,039
If you don't go back to school,

716
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,119
what about your alliance?

717
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,880
Your allies,

718
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,280
aren't they leaderless?

719
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,199
If I were you,

720
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,199
I would go back to school,

721
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,880
Because I want to use

722
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,760
the Chinese culture I carry,

723
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
To infect more foreigners.

724
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:01,800
Sister, sister, sister-in-law,

725
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,239
no, sister-in-law,

726
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
I didn't expect you to know me so well.

727
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
You know me better than my brother.

728
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,320
We are the same kind of people.

729
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,719
Come on.

730
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,559
A soldier dies for a man who knows his own heart.

731
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,440
Sister, here's to you.

732
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,519
No,

733
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,760
I drove here.

734
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,519
I'll thank Sister-in-law for you

735
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,440
and have some more.

736
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,920
Okay,

737
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,360
Sister-in-law,

738
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,239
have some. Eat more.

739
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,920
Okay, I'll eat it then.

740
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,639
This is a stubborn donkey.

741
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,239
Did you convince him?

742
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,480
Yeah,

743
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,679
maybe it's because,

744
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,599
I'm stubborn, too.

745
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,679
Baby, you're amazing.

746
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,639
I … I … I … I … I … I

747
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,480
will send him away first.

748
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,920
I'm leaving.

749
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:42,679
Goodbye.

750
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,159
Goodbye.

751
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
Let's talk about it.

752
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,800
I called you last night,

753
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,159
but why didn't you pick up?

754
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,320
I don't want to answer it.

755
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,400
How about we have dinner together tonight?

756
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,960
At least we're colleagues.

757
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:32,880
I'm leaving.

758
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,920
Just a meal.

759
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:38,960
I'll make a deal

760
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,320
tonight.

761
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,920
Eight o'clock in the evening,

762
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,039
I'll send you the address later.

763
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,559
Little kid.

764
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm treating you to dinner today.

765
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,679
I just want to tell you that

766
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
I like you.

767
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,760
I've turned the page.

768
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:03,599
From now on,

769
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,480
we'll be friends.

770
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,039
Anyway, I'm so handsome,

771
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,159
there are a lot of people waiting in line.

772
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm leaving.

773
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,039
You have nothing to say to me.

774
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,639
I've known you for so long.

775
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,760
I've seen this before.

776
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
The wisest choice you've made,

777
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,519
you haven't seen me

778
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,239
when I was in college,

779
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,000
All-powerful

780
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
and handsome.

781
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,239
I'm telling you,

782
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,119
I'll show you the photos,

783
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,159
You will regret it.

784
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,480
Not bad.

785
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:49,599
Is that okay?

786
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,280
Sure

787
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,480
No,

788
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,000
this is a prank by my friend.

789
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:58,960
I forgot to delete it.

790
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,480
But to be honest,

791
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,000
you surprised me.

792
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,599
Of course.

793
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,400
In the future,

794
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,679
I will make you look at me with new eyes and ears.

795
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,280
What happened after I graduated from college?

796
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,400
Start a business as soon as you come back.

797
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,239
I promise.

798
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,679
Within three years, the company will be listed,

799
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,480
and within five years, it will be among the top 500 companies in the world,

800
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,360
Don't believe me.

801
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:15,679
Of course

802
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,599
I do.

803
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,480
So?

804
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,039
Go back and study hard.

805
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:19,679
Eat well,

806
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,400
don't skip class,

807
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,239
Most importantly,

808
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,840
don't fight with others.

809
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,199
I graduated smoothly.

810
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,519
Will you wait for me?

811
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,480
Good luck.

812
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,719
Everything is going well.

813
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,679
I met Gu Qiao.

814
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,199
Say goodbye to Gu Qiao.

815
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,840
Have you packed your luggage?

816
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,679
If you don't want to go back and meet your parents,

817
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,119
no need.

818
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,559
I don't need to see you off,

819
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,719
and you don't need to see me off.

820
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,960
I can take a taxi myself.

821
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,800
I'm not going to give you a ride.

822
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,360
You won't miss me

823
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,000
if you're loyal.

824
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,320
The mountain has no edges,

825
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,039
the heaven and earth are united,

826
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,440
That's why I dare to break up with you.

827
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,159
Brother is affectionate,

828
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,480
brother is righteous,

829
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,800
You won't leave?

830
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,000
I won't give up.

831
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,840
Take it.

832
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,679
When I graduated,

833
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,840
my mom gave it to me.

834
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,440
I'm giving it to you in advance.

835
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,440
Think of it as a graduation gift.

836
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,119
Really?

837
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,320
My brother,

838
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,960
I will never fight in the future.

839
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,760
I must study hard.

840
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
They hit me on the left side of the face,

841
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,840
I told him to hit me on the right face.

842
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,920
Nice.

843
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,440
So,

844
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,119
what do you think about

845
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,199
Xiong Qiming?

846
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,239
It's endless. Why?

847
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm telling you,

848
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,880
the person sitting in that position,

849
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,159
He's very shrewd,

850
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,039
don't look at his usual life,

851
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:16,760
Polite,

852
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,480
seems to be smiling at everyone,

853
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,719
What's on your mind?

854
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,000
No one knows,

855
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,480
like Mr. Fu,

856
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,440
You always say what do you think

857
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
during the meeting?

858
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,280
What do you think?

859
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,800
She's the one who makes the final decision.

860
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,719
What are we talking about?

861
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,800
It's just an opinion.

862
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,000
I really listen to you.

863
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,880
Can't you guess

864
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,719
what they're thinking?

865
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,440
Don't think about it.

866
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,599
So you don't think

867
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,199
Gu Qiao is suitable to be with him.

868
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:41,639
Right?

869
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,039
Gu Qiao is a grown-up now.

870
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,480
You don't have to worry about her.

871
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,719
She can make her own decisions.

872
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,480
Didn't you

873
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:49,800
just say

874
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,840
he's shrewd?

875
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,280
Then.

876
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,159
No matter how smart Gu Qiao is,

877
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:53,800
she's still a woman.

878
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,239
She'll get hurt easily.

879
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,320
A cognitive mistake,

880
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,079
a shrewd man,

881
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,719
It doesn't mean you'll hurt Gu Qiao.

882
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,239
Don't think too much.

883
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,800
When you go abroad,

884
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,199
play less games,

885
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,199
Read more books

886
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,599
and graduate as soon as possible.

887
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,960
I came back to serve my country.

888
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,960
Brother,

889
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,760
Open another bottle of red wine.

890
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,519
Let's drink together.

891
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,320
Stingy,
