1
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,799
I thought you were going to see him off.

2
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,519
Children don't like

3
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,680
parting scenes.

4
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,680
I won't go.

5
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,920
Like his style.

6
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,200
Back to work,

7
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
What if Mr. Fu

8
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,439
agrees to Yuan Ge's plan?

9
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,120
In that case, Shu Mei's next focus,

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,319
will definitely invest most of her

11
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,439
manpower and financial resources

12
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,840
in the promotion and operation of Li Meng,

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,680
Then Shumei's original market

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
will shrink rapidly, right?

15
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,599
The only thing that Guangke liked

16
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,719
was Li Yuan.

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,080
If Shu Mei wants to be with Li Meng

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,240
and blossom together,

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,919
Shumei, you have to rely on yourself.

20
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,000
But Ge Ge is actually more interested

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
in Shumei's cheap market,

22
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,240
In the past two years, cheap domestic products,

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
that's the beauty

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,240
of Baihua Qifang,

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
And the market share

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,360
is getting lower and lower.

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
I don't know how to help her.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Not bad.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
You know how to analyze the market,

30
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,800
are you complimenting me or hurting me?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,039
When I first came to Shumei,

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
I had a successful joint name

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,159
with Divanon Weiss,

34
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,439
I think successful experiences

35
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,439
can be replicated.

36
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,479
Are you interested?

37
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,439
Me,

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,199
I can't talk about it.

39
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,479
For a big brand like Divanon Weiss,

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,159
a joint name is not necessarily

41
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,599
a joint name

42
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,319
between brands.

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,599
You can expand it,

44
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,280
think about it,

45
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,280
It can also be co-branded

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,039
with other things.

47
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,159
Of course,

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
good ideas take time.

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,639
If you're interested,

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
I can wait for you.

51
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,919
I'll leave now.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,919
I've finished typing the information for you.

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,439
Take a look.

54
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Why isn't Hao Shuai here?

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,840
The handyman on the desk is also gone.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,439
If you don't know,

58
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,520
how would I know?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
Hao Shuai resigned.

60
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,759
Resign,

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why?

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,599
Isn't that what kids do now?

63
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,800
I quit if I say I don't want to.

64
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,000
This is so heartless.

65
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,000
I was so nice to him,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,479
and I didn't even tell him to resign.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
You deserve better.

68
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,840
As for President Fu's skills,

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,039
among all the female players

70
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,199
I know,

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,319
One of the best. Why are there

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,439
men and women in the arena?

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,600
Anyway, I just have to

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
admit that I've lost.

75
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,519
Please have a seat.

76
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,759
Thank you.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
Mr. Xiong is such an elegant person,

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
it's really hard to think of him

79
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,240
as Guangke,

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,279
A calculating boss,

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,720
will this be called

82
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
hiding something from others?

83
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,439
Then I'll be Mr. Fu.

84
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,319
Are you complimenting me?

85
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,519
Recently, I heard some rumors

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
that Yahyun is going to enter China.

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,800
Rumor has it

88
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,360
that

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,319
Mr. Xiong has contacted them.

90
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,399
Yes,

91
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,000
we have always used

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
the most

93
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,439
sincere attitude,

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
Working with Guangke,

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
in our cooperation,

96
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,480
Exclusivity is not required.

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,839
It's because I thought Mr. Xiong

98
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,680
was also devoted to it.

99
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
I hope that Li Juncheng can be made into.

100
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,680
The first top-end skin care brand

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
in the country,

102
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,560
Mr. Fu, you flatter me.

103
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,759
After all,

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,079
I'm just a businessman.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,959
On the premise of

106
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,759
abiding by the contract,

107
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,160
Of course, I will maximize

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
all the benefits.

109
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,120
Mr. Xiong, what you mean is,

110
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,040
as long as Yayuan gives you

111
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,319
a proper price,

112
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,360
You're just as cooperative as they are.

113
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,759
Mr. Fu,

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,000
I understand your concern.

115
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,439
But even if I promise you now,

116
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,240
I can serve the two

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,759
competing companies equally.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,120
But Mr. Fu,

119
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,439
you may not believe me.

120
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,720
If Mr. Fu wants me

121
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
to say no to Yahyun,

122
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,480
In fact, it's very simple. I'd like

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,439
to hear more about it.

124
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,199
Let me see,

125
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,040
Li Meng's determination to become

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
the first high-end skin care brand in China.

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
I've also heard about

128
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,279
Mr. Fu's career path,

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,439
As I'm sure

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,639
you're well aware,

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Shopping malls are like battlefields,

132
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,199
and sometimes what we need,

133
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,759
is the courage

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
to give it a shot,

135
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,920
Don't you think so?

136
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,839
Okay,

137
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,199
Let's make

138
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,439
a gentleman's agreement now,

139
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,480
As long as you

140
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,480
refuse to cooperate with Yahyun,

141
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm willing to

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,519
double Li's advertising budget

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,839
every year,

144
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,040
And then add another three years.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,800
A cooperation plan

146
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,079
with Guangke.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,879
You're indeed Mr. Fu.

148
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,240
You're so bold.

149
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,319
Then we wish you

150
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,360
a happy cooperation.

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,519
Happy cooperation.

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,439
For the next month,

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,879
you have to be mentally prepared

154
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,680
to work overtime,

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
Mr. Du and I will implement

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,839
the relevant matters of the store as soon as possible,

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,680
Yanxi,

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
do a good job in the market of each city,

159
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,959
According to the actual situation,

160
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,160
plan the store activities,

161
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,920
Yes.

162
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr. Zhang,

163
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
all categories of Li Meng,

164
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
We must ensure sufficient quantity of goods.

165
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,759
I don't need to emphasize

166
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,480
quality control anymore, do I?

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,920
Understood.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,639
I'll talk to the factory.

169
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,560
Sister Wang,

170
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,920
this way,

171
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,680
For the specific needs,

172
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
check with Yanxi. "

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,240
Okay,

174
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,800
Sister Kwon,

175
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,879
it's urgent to follow the authority,

176
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,079
I hope the Finance Department,

177
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,879
can set up a special team

178
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,160
for Li Meng,

179
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,920
All the money involved in Li Jingzhi,

180
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
you can give priority to it.

181
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,759
Okay.

182
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,199
All right, time is running out.

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
That's all for today's meeting.

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,319
Come on, guys!

185
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,879
Come on!

186
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,120
Come on, come on!

187
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,399
Dad,

188
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,639
Uncle,

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
why are you here?

190
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,399
Why didn't you

191
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,440
call me in advance?

192
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,360
Me

193
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,399
The company organized retirees to travel,

194
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,000
so I followed them.

195
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,759
Look at you.

196
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,720
I came here specially for you

197
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,159
for more than two months,

198
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,759
You didn't even contact your family.

199
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,720
Your parents are worried sick.

200
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,440
You didn't answer my calls

201
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,519
or text messages.

202
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,960
Look at you, kid,

203
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,279
Dad,

204
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,480
Let's talk inside.

205
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,440
Your parents

206
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
brought you bacon.

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,279
Uncle,

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,039
Come on

209
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,799
Have some water. It's too hot outside.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Uncle,

211
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,080
what do you think of this house?

212
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,960
Ge Ge participated in the design.

213
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,639
Is it awesome?

214
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,399
Really?

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,159
That's great.

216
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,120
Okay,

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,639
Ge Ge By the way,

218
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,519
change the bed sheet

219
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,559
and quilt cover in my room,

220
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,399
Let uncle stay.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
No need.

222
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,080
I'll sleep on the sofa.

223
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,039
Just sleep for one night,

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,639
and tomorrow I'll meet up

225
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,519
with the big army.

226
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,039
Well,

227
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,679
how can you sleep on the sofa?

228
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,200
Besides,

229
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
it's not easy for you to come here,

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,120
Let Ge Ge take you out

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,279
for a walk.

232
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,080
Well

233
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,919
Hey, Yeon-hee,

234
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,639
tell me,

235
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,279
Got it.

236
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,320
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

237
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,679
Check carefully.

238
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,279
Look how busy she is.

239
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,879
How can you have time to go shopping with me?

240
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,639
If I have time,

241
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,440
can I go shopping with you?

242
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll go with you.

243
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
No need.

244
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,559
I can't delay

245
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,840
the work of you young people,

246
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,279
What kind of delay is this?

247
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Just stay here

248
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,559
and watch TV first,

249
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,039
I'll cook for you.

250
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,440
Let me tell you,

251
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,639
I learned a new dish recently,

252
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,480
It's called Coke Chicken Wings.

253
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,559
It's delicious.

254
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,399
What else do you want to eat?

255
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
I've already done it.

256
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,240
I love everything you make.

257
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

258
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,679
Come on,

259
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,480
Yuan Ge

260
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,279
Gu Qiao really impressed me.

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
In such a short time,

262
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,279
you've cooked so many dishes,

263
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,919
That's amazing.

264
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,679
Then you can eat more.

265
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,639
Come on, have a drink.

266
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
I don't drink.

267
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,679
Have you given up drinking?

268
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,360
No.

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,879
You're old,

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,879
so you should be self-disciplined.

271
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,720
You can't be as indulgent as you were

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,639
when you were young.

273
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,080
-I'll replace wine with tea. -Okay.

274
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,240
Come on,

275
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,559
Come on,

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,000
Come on,

277
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,039
Touch it,

278
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,279
touch it,

279
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
The three of us are so happy to see each other.

280
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,200
Gu Qiao,

281
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
I should thank you too.

282
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
With Yuan Ge,

283
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,919
without you,

284
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,720
She has to eat takeout every day.

285
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,240
She can't cook.

286
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,519
Uncle, please don't say that.

287
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,440
If it weren't for Ge Ge,

288
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,759
I'd be living on the street.

289
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,759
What you said is so tragic.

290
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm glad to see you this time.

291
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm so happy.

292
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,799
In Shanghai,

293
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,720
you two support each other,

294
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,840
Help each other.

295
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,639
I can rest assured.

296
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm really relieved.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,919
Uncle,

298
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,639
Do you have something

299
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,639
to tell us,

300
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,399
Me

301
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,919
Tell me,

302
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,799
Didn't I just tell you?

303
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm just traveling with the team.

304
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,039
What can I do for you?

305
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,559
By the way, I came to see you.

306
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,799
Come on. Dad, try some chicken wings.

307
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
Gu Qiao,

308
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,639
this is the Coke Chicken Wings

309
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,080
you mentioned,

310
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
It's delicious.

311
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,720
It tastes different.

312
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,440
Eat more then.

313
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,399
Who will marry Gu Qiao in the future?

314
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
That's a blessing.

315
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,399
Gu Qiao didn't learn

316
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:29,919
to cook

317
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,960
to be a housewife,

318
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,200
Yes

319
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,519
Who cooks well

320
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,919
or badly,

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,480
I didn't mean it

322
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,679
because of my uncle.

323
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,039
Uncle,

324
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
What kind of person

325
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,919
do you want Ge Ge to find?

326
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
What are you looking for?

327
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
What can I ask for?

328
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
As long as you understand her

329
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
and can

330
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,600
take care of her.

331
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,759
Don't be like me.

332
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,360
I don't need others to take care of me.

333
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,440
Gu Qiao,

334
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,960
Uncle,

335
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,399
Are you used to living here?

336
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,759
Are the sheets and quilts okay?

337
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,679
It's good.

338
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm fine. Thank you.

339
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,519
Well,

340
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,240
my parents,

341
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,399
We see each other a lot,

342
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,480
Your mom

343
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,039
It's good.

344
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,159
Everything is fine.

345
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,600
Okay, go to bed early.

346
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,639
Gu Qiao,

347
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,279
what's wrong?

348
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,039
A few days ago,

349
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,879
your dad went to work at a construction site,

350
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,679
He said he was paying off your foreign debt,

351
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,159
result

352
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,519
I sprained my waist.

353
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,159
It's quite serious.

354
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,559
He didn't go to the hospital.

355
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,159
Me,

356
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
I told him several times but he wouldn't listen,

357
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,360
so I sent him some plaster,

358
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,559
She might feel better now.

359
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,240
Call me later and ask.

360
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,519
Uncle,

361
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,120
Go to bed early.

362
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,399
Are you still busy?

363
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
Can I have a word with you?

364
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,600
It'll be fine in a while.

365
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,320
Just a few words.

366
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,960
Just listen to me.

367
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,200
I know you've always had a knot in your heart.

368
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,679
It's about the relationship

369
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,039
between your mother and me,

370
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,559
I regret now that

371
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,080
I was too young,

372
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,160
You have a bad temper,

373
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,119
and your work is not going well.

374
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,839
I don't have much life experience,

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
and I didn't take good care of your mother and daughter.

376
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,759
Especially.

377
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,119
I didn't give you

378
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,079
the fatherly love you deserve.

379
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,319
You blame me for this,

380
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,400
I understand.

381
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,720
But in my opinion,

382
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,359
you can't let these problems

383
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
affect your own views

384
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,680
on marriage.

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,319
I regret it now.

386
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,720
After all these years,

387
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
You don't have a boyfriend,

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,039
you don't have a relationship,

389
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,880
I feel guilty.

390
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
I think what you're doing now,

391
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,519
it's all my fault.

392
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,799
Yes.

393
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,839
I... I'm sorry

394
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,759
for your mother and daughter.

395
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,799
Especially you.

396
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,039
If at the beginning,

397
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,279
I could have solved

398
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,160
the relationship problem with your mother,

399
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,359
I'll give you the fatherly love you deserve.

400
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
Maybe you've been living a life

401
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,880
like your peers,

402
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,319
A family life with both children and children.

403
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,240
Dad,

404
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,759
Did something happen?

405
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,640
No.

406
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
Nothing happened.

407
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,720
I just want to tell you,

408
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,039
you are very strong and outstanding.

409
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,680
In Shanghai,

410
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,200
you broke into a world.

411
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,319
I'm proud of you.

412
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,720
But I also hope that

413
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,119
your relationship

414
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,839
can be supported as soon as possible.

415
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,920
That's all?

416
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,319
Why did you come back so late?

417
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,559
He didn't answer your calls.

418
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,079
I was going to look for you.

419
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,960
The boss said,

420
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,119
work more and pay more,

421
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,279
So I worked overtime for a while.

422
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,079
But you can't work so hard.

423
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,440
All right, let's eat.

424
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll heat up the dishes for you.

425
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,559
I'm so worried.

426
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:44,839
Qiao Qiao.

427
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,079
I'm hanging up.

428
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,079
Hey,

429
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,160
Qiao Qiao,

430
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,680
You,

431
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,880
Why did you hang up

432
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,839
when you called me?

433
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,079
I want to talk to you.

434
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,200
Don't hang up.

435
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:32,960
Where's Mom?

436
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,880
I didn't do it well,

437
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,559
but do you know

438
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,759
why I did it?

439
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,559
I just think,

440
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,279
where's Luan Yu?

441
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,720
Their family is well-off.

442
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,319
If you go with him,

443
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,359
You can suffer

444
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,799
a lot less.

445
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,279
You can take your brother with you,

446
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,200
but now it seems,

447
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,759
I'm being selfish.

448
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
I'm not okay.

449
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,039
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,640
I won't say anything.

451
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,279
What about you?

452
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,039
Live a good life

453
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,440
and work hard,

454
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,039
Where's your dad and I?

455
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,720
We've all found new jobs,

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
rich people,

457
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
With your dad,

458
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,319
we can save thousands of yuan

459
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,319
in retirement salary every month.

460
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,160
Save the money,

461
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,720
and we'll keep it for you.

462
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,359
We'll pay the bill

463
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,680
with you.

464
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,039
Okay,

465
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,279
I got it.

466
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,559
Well,

467
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,839
My dad,

468
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,160
how is his waist?

469
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,279
Your dad,

470
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,200
it's nothing.

471
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,400
My waist just flickered a little.

472
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,400
It's okay.

473
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,359
Don't worry about it.

474
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,279
We're all fine.

475
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,200
As long as you are well.

476
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,240
Okay,

477
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,799
it's too late.

478
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm hanging up.

479
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm hanging up.

480
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,640
I called your mom.

481
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,359
I did.

482
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,119
Then.

483
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,039
How is

484
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,440
your waist injury?

485
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
Much better.

486
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,359
I just need some rest.

487
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,599
In fact,

488
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
even if your parents

489
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,240
did something wrong before,

490
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,799
As juniors,

491
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,279
we should pay more attention to them.

492
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,400
I know.

493
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,400
You're still talking about me,

494
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,119
aren't you doing the same thing to me?

495
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,039
Our families are in a different situation.

496
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,119
I think Uncle has changed a lot

497
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,880
since he came here this time.

498
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,400
He's so old,

499
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,519
you should

500
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
talk to him later.

501
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,920
Actually, I don't blame him anymore.

502
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,759
It's just that

503
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,559
we haven't had any feelings for each other.

504
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,720
So now you don't know

505
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,759
how to get along with each other?

506
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,160
He's retired,

507
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,680
and he's all alone.

508
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
There's no one to talk to.

509
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,920
Actually, I think

510
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
he came to me this time,

511
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,119
There must be something wrong.

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,039
But when I asked him,

513
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,079
he wouldn't tell me,

514
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,960
If you think too much,

515
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,160
what can happen to me?

516
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,599
He must miss you.

517
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,759
So, during this period of time,

518
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,359
you should cultivate your relationship

519
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,279
with uncle.

520
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,480
Let him stay

521
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,880
for a few more days.

522
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,440
Dad, Gu Qiao

523
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,519
is out for dinner.

524
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,319
Ge Ge, you guys eat first.

525
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,039
I'll be right there.

526
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,920
Dad, breakfast is ready.

527
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,359
You can eat now.

528
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,880
Dad,

529
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Dad.

530
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,960
Time to eat.

531
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,839
I'm going to meet up with the army.

532
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,839
Retired cadres

533
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,039
should also obey organizational discipline.

534
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,839
Pay attention, both of you.

535
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,119
Work and rest,

536
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,039
remember,

537
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,240
Work is not the whole of life.

538
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,240
Just leave as you say.

539
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,119
Did you really do it?

540
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,319
Yuan Ge didn't make it for you.

541
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,400
Absolutely not.

542
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,880
I'm really impressed with you.

543
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,759
Combine Shumei

544
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,920
with Guoman and the post-00s.

545
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,640
This idea,

546
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,160
I like it,

547
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:48,880
Really?

548
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,319
You didn't make me happy, did you?

549
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,359
There's no need.

550
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,720
If you want to coax Yuan Ge,

551
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,519
Shangdao

552
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,839
Okay, not bad.

553
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll leave it to you.

554
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,559
Okay,

555
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,759
Recently,

556
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,680
I've been very optimistic about

557
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,079
a popular Chinese manga artist,

558
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,960
Her name is Bai Xue.

559
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,960
What about her work?

560
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,839
It's all from Chinese

561
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,759
traditional culture,

562
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,119
Draw some inspiration,

563
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,920
and then combine with

564
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,119
the most popular comics,

565
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,559
For creation and adaptation.

566
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,720
post-00s likes it very much,

567
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:15,759
and she has

568
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,799
a lot of "fans" overseas,

569
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,279
If we can

570
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,079
work with her,

571
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,319
Maybe he can get famous out of the circle.

572
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,000
Although I don't quite understand

573
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,920
what it means to get famous out of the circle?

574
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,720
But it doesn't matter.

575
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll leave it to you.

576
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,839
But be careful,

577
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,000
you must pay attention to the details.

578
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,799
Put an end to future troubles.

579
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,359
Don't worry.

580
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,599
Go ahead.

581
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,119
Mom,

582
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,799
Bin Sun

583
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm here.

584
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,599
Is Uncle back?

585
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,119
You're back.

586
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,279
Uncle is back.

587
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,680
Sun, you're here.

588
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,960
By the way,

589
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,559
I've made you one, too.

590
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,319
I put it here.

591
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,039
You prepared it for me?

592
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,000
Thank you.

593
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,680
Did you see your daughter yesterday?

594
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,400
I didn't see her

595
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,839
on a business trip,

596
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,279
How are you feeling today?

597
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm fine.

598
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:15,759
Okay,

599
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,559
Did you get in touch with your daughter?

600
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,440
For your surgery,

601
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,160
you need to hurry up and do it.

602
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,559
Dr. Li, can you please make an exception for me?

603
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,720
My daughter went abroad.

604
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,880
She won't be able to come back for a while.

605
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,400
This hospital has a hospital policy,

606
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,519
without the signature of family members,

607
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,359
We really

608
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,319
can't operate on you.

609
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,319
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

610
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,319
But for my own business,

611
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,599
I should decide for myself.

612
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,319
I'll sign it.

613
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,240
if

614
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,200
What's wrong with the surgery?

615
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
It has my signature.

616
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,680
My daughter won't

617
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
hold you accountable.

618
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,720
You'd better

619
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,960
make an appointment with your daughter.

620
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,319
When you come to the hospital to sign your name,

621
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,519
I can arrange the surgery for you.

622
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,079
Your illness can't be delayed.

623
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,400
Okay, hurry up

624
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,400
and have a good rest. Would you like

625
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,359
to try it?

626
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,240
Don't you want some?

627
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,960
Enjoy your meal.

628
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,160
I'll have another one later.

629
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,039
Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-Deputy,

630
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,839
Vice of what?

631
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,759
Deputy cadre,

632
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,759
tell me,

633
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,319
No matter how busy you are, you can be as busy as you want.

634
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,440
His own father,

635
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,519
you said he was living in the hospital,

636
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,079
You didn't even bring it to have a look.

637
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,519
I'm not a deputy cadre.

638
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,559
He's the vice president,

639
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,960
the second-in-command of the company.

640
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,680
I heard from my colleagues,

641
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,519
Shumei is

642
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,480
a very big company,

643
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,119
Maybe his daughter is really busy,

644
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,519
son,

645
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
No matter how capable this woman is,

646
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
we can't marry her.

647
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,079
Why do you think a woman like this

648
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,799
should put filial piety first?

649
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,640
If a person

650
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
is not dutiful,

651
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,039
You're just not kind.

652
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Am I right?

653
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,920
Mom, you eat first.

654
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,039
I'll wash some fruit for you,

655
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,400
Okay.

656
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,640
Brother Sun

657
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,160
is here.

658
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,759
Uncle.

659
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,319
Here's an apple.

660
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
Thank you, Sun.

661
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,279
You think of my uncle

662
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,640
for everything,

663
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,920
Did your daughter

664
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,279
really go abroad?

665
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,039
To tell you the truth,

666
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
she's just too busy with her work,

667
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,319
This is another minor surgery.

668
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,680
It's not a big deal.

669
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,440
I'm afraid it'll delay her work.

670
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,240
So,

671
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,759
Uncle,

672
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,759
I have to say something to you.

673
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,359
Between father and daughter,

674
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,920
there's nothing that can't be delayed.

675
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,720
Let's not talk about whether the disease is serious or minor,

676
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,839
even if it's a minor illness,

677
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,640
Then you have to let her know,

678
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,599
because,

679
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm a child.

680
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,400
I think no matter what,

681
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,640
you have to tell her,

682
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,359
What do you think?

683
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
You're right.

684
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,440
Let me think about it.

685
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,319
I'll take a walk in the garden.

686
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,680
Drink it when you're back.

687
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,880
For the chicken soup you made for me,

688
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,799
slow down.

689
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,680
Mr. Yuan,

690
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,559
the receptionist downstairs said,

691
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,039
Mr. Sun wants to see you.

692
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,599
Mr. Sun,

693
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,680
Yes.

694
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,640
Hello,

695
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,240
are you Mr. Sun?

696
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,119
Hello,

697
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,599
my name is Sun Bin,

698
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,200
Are you Yuan Ge, Miss Yuan?

699
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,359
It's me.

700
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,440
There's one thing

701
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,000
I want to tell you.

702
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,119
It's such a big thing,

703
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,240
why didn't you tell me?

704
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,680
It's just a pimple, isn't it?

705
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,160
It's not a big deal

706
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
to have an operation,

707
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
The doctor said,

708
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,839
if you don't operate again,

709
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
If your tumor compresses your nerves,

710
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,200
you'll be paralyzed.

711
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Don't listen to the doctor.

712
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,200
They always exaggerate,

713
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,960
do I ask you

714
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,160
to have a physical examination every year?

715
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,079
You've been perfunctory with me every year,

716
00:33:59,079 --> 00:33:59,720
but now it's fine.

717
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,440
Something's wrong, right?

718
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,400
My own body,

719
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,640
I know it in my heart,

720
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,799
Are you trying to

721
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,119
piss me off?

722
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:05,839
Old Yuan,

723
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,319
you kid,

724
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:06,720
You,

725
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
She … She is your daughter.

726
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,280
This is my daughter,

727
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,920
Yuan Ge,

728
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,360
This is Aunt Sun?

729
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,199
This is Aunt Sun's son,

730
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,159
Sun Bin.

731
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,679
Hello. Hello.

732
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,199
All right, it's my own business.

733
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,039
I can handle it myself.

734
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:27,960
Go back to the office.

735
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,960
If you can handle it,

736
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,480
can I stand here now?

737
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,239
Son,

738
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,079
you can't talk to dad

739
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,119
like that,

740
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,079
You can't do that.

741
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,840
I'll be like this for the rest of my life.

742
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,119
You're the only one who can educate others.

743
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,800
You never listen to me.

744
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,639
Have you ever thought about

745
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,599
my feelings.

746
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,960
If anything happens to you,

747
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,440
what will you do if I'm alone?

748
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,679
I'll get the doctor to sign it.

749
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,960
Miss Yuan.

750
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:40,840
Thank you.

751
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,119
Well,

752
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm sorry,

753
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,480
My mom is

754
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,559
a straightforward person,

755
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,239
Don't take

756
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,480
what she said to heart.

757
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,920
Actually, Auntie is right.

758
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,239
I can't be a daughter like that.

759
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,920
His father was ill in the hospital,

760
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,639
and he didn't even know it.

761
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,559
It's not your fault.

762
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,440
I don't want to affect your work.

763
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,760
I kept it from you on purpose.

764
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,880
Mr. Sun,

765
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,880
thank you all the same.

766
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,480
If it wasn't for you,

767
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,679
I wouldn't know until now,

768
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,480
And I heard from the nurse,

769
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,599
during my dad's stay in the hospital,

770
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,000
Thanks to you taking care of him.

771
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,199
Thank you so much.

772
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,440
You're too kind.

773
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,039
Actually, I didn't do anything.

774
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,039
It's just a little thing

775
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,280
that I can do,

776
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, right.

777
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,599
This is my business card.

778
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,559
I haven't been busy with work lately,

779
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,719
so I come to the hospital more often,

780
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,280
If there's anything

781
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
I can do for you.

782
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,360
Just tell me.

783
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,360
Thank you.

784
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,760
I'll get going then.

785
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,000
Yuan,

786
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,199
Come on,

787
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,880
Eat an apple to calm down.

788
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,079
Thank you.

789
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,840
Sorry to make you laugh.

790
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Every family has a difficult experience.

791
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,519
Besides, it's not easy

792
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:38,840
being a child.

793
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,880
I think your daughter

794
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,159
is actually worried about you.

795
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,000
She doesn't understand me.

796
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm afraid it'll put more burden on her.

797
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,679
It's not a burden

798
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,199
for a family.

799
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,679
She's your daughter.

800
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,880
She has to take care of you.

801
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,039
Yuan,

802
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,480
I think,

803
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,239
Sometimes we don't think for ourselves,

804
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
but you have to think for your children.

805
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,039
People they don't know,

806
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:03,960
they really think you're alone,

807
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,079
Lying in the hospital,

808
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,599
the child is not dutiful?

809
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Am I right?

810
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,000
According to what you said,

811
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,840
it's my fault,

812
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,199
You have to learn from me

813
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
that we have children and adopted daughters,

814
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,719
You mean most of your life?

815
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,480
You're already in the hospital bed.

816
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,760
Shouldn't you be more open-minded?

817
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,559
Uncle,

818
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,159
you should have told me earlier.

819
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,199
When Ge Ge told me about it,

820
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,159
he scared me to death.

821
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,880
It's okay.

822
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,320
Don't worry.

823
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,280
Do you think it's okay?

824
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,440
What do you think of Ge Ge?

825
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,159
Ge Ge,

826
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,079
you're the last family left.

827
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,159
If anything happens to you,

828
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,039
what do you want her to do?

829
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,400
Now,

830
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,679
the medical level is so high,

831
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,239
It's okay. Don't worry.

832
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Listen,

833
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,719
you have to think more about Ge Ge.

834
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,920
Ge Ge is worried about you.

835
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,440
Yes

836
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,440
The bed in the hospital is thick enough,

837
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,599
so you don't need to bring that blanket.

838
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,159
Isn't it comfortable to live in your own room?

839
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,119
This is my patient, Auntie Sun. Hello,

840
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,280
Auntie,

841
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Hello,

842
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,320
Yuan Who is this?

843
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
This is my daughter's good friend,

844
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,280
Gu Qiao,

845
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,800
Gu,

846
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,000
this kid

847
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,159
is beautiful,

848
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,000
You're quick at work.

849
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,719
Do you have a date?

850
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
I just met my parents.

851
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,239
Let me get you some water.

852
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,079
Aunt Sun,

853
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,079
this is your medicine for tonight.

854
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,840
I'll leave it here.

855
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,480
Thank you.

856
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,719
Brother Sun is not here.

857
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,000
He works in a bank,

858
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,320
You're so busy.

859
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,320
-Be busy. -Okay, Uncle

860
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,239
Yuan.

861
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,280
This is your medicine for tonight.

862
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,440
Your surgery is tomorrow.

863
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,599
After ten o'clock tonight,

864
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,559
no food is allowed.

865
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,119
The doctor told me I know.

866
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:33,920
Thank you.

867
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,559
Have a good rest.

868
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,960
Uncle,

869
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,920
be careful. It's hot.

870
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,960
A little nurse

871
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,480
still misses my son,

872
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,360
Uncle Yuan.

873
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,159
Sun Bin.

874
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,800
Why did you buy so many fruits?

875
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,239
I don't like it.

876
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,679
What a waste. I didn't

877
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,400
buy it here.

878
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:04,400
Yuan Ge bought it

879
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,079
for you,

880
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,159
For me?

881
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,360
Why?

882
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,079
Yuan Ge said,

883
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,480
thank us.

884
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,880
I've been taking care of Uncle Yuan,

885
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:18,760
Old Yuan,

886
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,239
Your daughter is a bit of a stranger.

887
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,840
What are you doing?

888
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,800
We're living

889
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,079
in the same ward,

890
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,880
We just take care of each other, don't we?

891
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,119
Yes, yes.

892
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,960
Son,

893
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,639
go wash some apples.

894
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,119
Wash one for Uncle Yuan, too.

895
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:34,960
Hurry up.

896
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,360
I'll wash them all.

897
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,440
You … You.

898
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,719
Yuan,

899
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,239
call you daughter,

900
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,000
You can't do this in the future.

901
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,719
Okay, okay, okay.
