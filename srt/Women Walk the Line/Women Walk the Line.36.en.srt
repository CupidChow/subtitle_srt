1
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,870
It won't be.

2
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,150
Young man,

3
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,190
look for someone,

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes.

5
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,680
Hello,

6
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,560
is this Gu Qiao's house?

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,710
Yes, I

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,150
… I'm Gu Qiao's colleague.

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Welcome.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Sit down.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,680
I'll go get her.

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Okay,

13
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710
Gu Qiao,

14
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,710
Gu Qiao,

15
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,310
You have a colleague looking for you,

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,030
colleague,

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,750
I'll go take a look.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Who is it?

19
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,280
Hao Shuai,

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
why are you here?

21
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,840
I came to Anhui on a business trip these two days,

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,560
so I wanted to drop by to see you.

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,630
Let's go inside. Let's go.

24
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,030
No, no, I'm in a hurry.

25
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,910
I'll leave soon.

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,470
Why don't we sit here and talk?

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Okay.

28
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,030
You guys go ahead.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,630
I'll make you some desserts.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,310
Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

31
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,630
Have a seat.

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Why are you in such a hurry this time?

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,520
I've booked a ticket.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,400
Your hometown is quite comfortable.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
There are mountains and water.

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,310
I came back from a business trip some time ago,

37
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,840
only to know that

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
so many things have happened recently.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Why are you so silly?

40
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,190
Take all the responsibility on your body.

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,310
I just told the truth.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,120
I don't want Shu Mei

43
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,840
to bear the stigma.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,150
But to be honest,

45
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,800
it's too impulsive of you to do so.

46
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,750
But if you don't

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,910
come forward and clarify,

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,400
Shumei might really be doomed.

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,750
So looking at it from another angle,

50
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,120
I admire you.

51
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,070
If it were me,

52
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,390
Me

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,310
Not as brave as you.

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,120
I know.

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,750
Are you here to comfort me?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,950
Don't worry.

57
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm not as fragile as you think.

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
What about you after that?

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,830
What's your plan?

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,950
Are you going back to Shanghai?

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
I haven't decided yet.

62
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,560
Let's calm down for a while.

63
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,750
What about you?

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,510
How have you been?

65
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,070
Me

66
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,630
In addition to visiting you today,

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,830
main

68
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,480
I want to say goodbye to you.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Say goodbye.

70
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,160
Where are you going?

71
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,120
Didn't I go on a business trip some time ago?

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
The boss is quite satisfied

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
with my project.

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,190
So,

75
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,360
you're going to give me a chance,

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Studying abroad

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,630
will take

78
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,160
about half a year,

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,430
That's good.

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Congratulations.

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
It's almost time.

82
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
I should go now.

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,950
By the way,

84
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,680
I brought you some gifts.

85
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,190
Leave it to uncle

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,720
and aunt. Let's go.

87
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,720
Everything is going well.

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,600
Come on!

89
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920
Gu Qiao,

90
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,870
I really want to

91
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,920
say goodbye to you this time.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,950
Because I finally understand,

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,870
the infatuation of not being loved,

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,270
I'm just moved by myself,

95
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,240
if I have a chance to see you again in the future.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
I hope at that time,

97
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
we will pursue each other in both directions.

98
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,870
Mr. Fu,

99
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,240
we've made a deal

100
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,830
that you want to live in a house

101
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,750
near Baona's house,

102
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,630
After you land,

103
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,920
just go there and sign the contract.

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,390
That's great.

105
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,870
Hello.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,310
What?

107
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,870
What do you think?

108
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,910
Look,

109
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,000
under this Weibo,

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,150
There are still a lot of anti-fans

111
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,870
who jointly boycott Shumei.

112
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
This year's netizens are too picky.

113
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,270
You said it's time for us

114
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,840
to pay compensation.

115
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,270
The one who should apologize should apologize.

116
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,390
What else do you want us to do?

117
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,390
Do you have to

118
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,270
beat us to death?

119
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,910
That's good.

120
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,270
It's much better than I expected.

121
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,750
I've talked to

122
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,600
the logistics company.

123
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,120
The customer can deliver the goods within half an hour

124
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
after placing the order.

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
Users from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai

126
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,750
will receive express delivery tomorrow morning.

127
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
Thank you for your hard work.

128
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Xia Meng,

129
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
let's go live.

130
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,080
Hello, babies.

131
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,910
Hello,

132
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,910
I'm Xia Meng,

133
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm the part-time lead anchor today,

134
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,000
but I haven't sold any goods.

135
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,030
So today

136
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,480
can be regarded as a sharing of

137
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
my personal interests

138
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,910
and hobbies,

139
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,390
Usually,

140
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,670
I like watching Guoman,

141
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,200
In the national comics circle,

142
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,390
it's kind of a little bit famous.

143
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,960
When she was young and ignorant,

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,910
she also helped Bai Xue

145
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,360
run her support club.

146
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,320
But now,

147
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm totally devoted

148
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
to our lovely Mr. Jia,

149
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,150
Now let me

150
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,320
introduce to you,

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,670
Jia Lao's new work,

152
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,390
this is it.

153
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Luxury makeup kit.

154
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,630
Where's this kit?

155
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,320
It's a new work

156
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,960
created by Jia Lao and Shu Mei.

157
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,790
So,

158
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

159
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
As long as you buy

160
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,390
Shu Mei's products,

161
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,960
You'll get

162
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,480
Jia Lao's new work for free,

163
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,670
Of course,

164
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,910
we have more than this one.

165
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
There are more styles

166
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,390
for babies.

167
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,550
Today, I'm going to give you

168
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,870
a surprise to reveal the secret.

169
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,600
Go get it.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,120
Okay,

171
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,200
This time,

172
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,120
we've prepared

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,240
four styles for you to choose from.

174
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,360
As a national brand,

175
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Shu Mei has been well received by many consumers.

176
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,910
Moving this Shu-Mei alliance,

177
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,150
Jia Laoguoman's new work is coming strongly,

178
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,320
And popular copyright,

179
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,750
to create the perfect makeup.

180
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,790
Look at our packaging box,

181
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,630
which is the latest pattern

182
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,080
drawn by Mr. Jia,

183
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,000
Look at

184
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,960
these beautiful colors,

185
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,630
It's all in our color plate.

186
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,790
We can match

187
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,150
different colors.

188
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,150
That's great.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yuan,

190
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
we sold them out.

191
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,630
All of our models are sold out.

192
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,270
Mr. Yuan, your plan is great. Thank you

193
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,080
for your hard work today.

194
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
Keep working hard tomorrow.

195
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,510
Come on!

196
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,630
Keep a low profile, keep a low profile,

197
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,550
keep a low profile.

198
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,390
Thank you for your hard work.

199
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,750
Night snack.

200
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,080
Thank you, sister.

201
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
You don't need to thank me.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,870
Thanks to Gu Qiao.

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,550
Welcome.

204
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
It's such an important day,

205
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,910
How can I be missing?

206
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,440
Am I right?

207
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,550
By the way,

208
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,960
Gu Qiao was called back by me,

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,150
Because Shumei was able to

210
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,120
get out of the predicament this time.

211
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,200
Thanks to Gu Qiao.

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,510
No,

213
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,030
If I ask Gu Qiao to come back this time,

214
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,440
everyone will have no problem with it, right?

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,270
No problem.

216
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,360
Welcome, Gu Qiao.

217
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,720
All right,

218
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,270
in order to celebrate Shu Mei's

219
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,120
initial success.

220
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,510
And when Gu Qiao comes back to Shu Mei,

221
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,270
I'll invite you to sing tonight,

222
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,510
Let's go.

223
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,670
-Let's go. -Come on, let's

224
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,600
go. -Sister

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Quan.

226
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,150
Let's go.

227
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,790
Let's go.

228
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
Another toast.

229
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't drink so much

230
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
in the future.

231
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,790
Aren't you happy?

232
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,960
Gu Qiao is back.

233
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,150
You made up with Gu Qiao,

234
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,960
and it's all settled.

235
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,790
Du Bingwen,

236
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,550
you know what?

237
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
Before.

238
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,030
You broke up with me.

239
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,080
When I went abroad alone.

240
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
Do you know how sad I am?

241
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,550
At that time,

242
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,790
you didn't reply me when I called you

243
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,360
or sent you WeChat messages.

244
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,960
I don't know where to find you.

245
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,750
I'm home alone every day.

246
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,480
I don't even know what I'm doing.

247
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,880
Then one day.

248
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,110
One night, I was drunk.

249
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,030
I thought you were back.

250
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,000
It's like a dream.

251
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,110
I don't want to wait any longer.

252
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,070
I don't want to either.

253
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,200
Every day when we get off work,

254
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,070
we have to say goodbye to each other.

255
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,200
I want to get up and go to

256
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,960
work with you every day.

257
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
Let's get off work

258
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,240
and go home together.

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,110
Let's eat together.

260
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,960
You're drunk.

261
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,070
You can lie in my arms like this.

262
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,720
I'll take care of you.

263
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
I've been through so much.

264
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,240
I think

265
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,750
I'm different from before.

266
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,830
Every time I thought about marriage.

267
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,880
When I think of my mom,

268
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,400
I feel anxious.

269
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,350
But now I think,

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
life is so short.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
I don't want to wait any longer.

272
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,440
Du Bingwen,

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,240
why don't you propose to me?

274
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,440
Are you serious?

275
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,790
I propose to you.

276
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,590
Do you mean now?

277
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,350
But now,

278
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,030
I'm not prepared

279
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,400
for anything.

280
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,640
I've prepared it for you.

281
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,030
So special.

282
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,960
She can only marry me.

283
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,510
Great, Gu Qiao.

284
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,880
We were worried about him.

285
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm afraid you won't go back to Shanghai.

286
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,030
When you came back with me yesterday,

287
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,790
I was quite surprised,

288
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,400
I thought

289
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,640
you were going back to Mr. Yuan's place?

290
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,790
When I heard a voice last night,

291
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,880
I said you were back,

292
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,350
Tell Yang Lei that he won't believe

293
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,550
me. I'm sorry,

294
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,640
I came back too late last night.

295
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,590
Sorry to disturb your sleep.

296
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,270
It's okay.

297
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,350
Youyou means,

298
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,440
welcome home.

299
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,920
Actually, we all like you.

300
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,030
Look at Xu Ling'er,

301
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,550
although she had a fight with you before,

302
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,070
But while you were away,

303
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,070
she chased us every day

304
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,960
and asked about your news,

305
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't ask every day.

306
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,480
I think if there's one less person,

307
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,270
the water and electricity costs will be even more.

308
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,510
Anyway,

309
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,790
thank you all.

310
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,720
Living with you?

311
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm really happy.

312
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,550
We're happy, too.

313
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,750
By the way,

314
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,400
they bought a new house.

315
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,830
Are you free tonight?

316
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,960
Let's celebrate together.

317
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,160
Really?

318
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,680
Okay, okay, okay,

319
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,310
Congratulations,

320
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,030
Finally, I have a home of my own

321
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,310
in Shanghai,

322
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,350
Originally,

323
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,960
I wanted to save some money to buy a new house,

324
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,070
But it's too late now.

325
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,310
Youyou is pregnant.

326
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Congratulations.

327
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,070
It doesn't matter whether the house is old or new,

328
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,880
the main thing is,

329
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
The landlord who sold our house

330
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,640
is also good,

331
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
He gave us a lot of furniture.

332
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,830
I saved a lot of money.

333
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,400
That's right.

334
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,790
You're

335
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,590
so happy.

336
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,240
I wanted to start a career before,

337
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
but now I see you like this,

338
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
I think it's good to have a home.

339
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,640
Come on,

340
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,160
We'll use porridge instead of wine

341
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,270
to bless you.

342
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,000
Come on,

343
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,480
bless me,

344
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Cheers! Cheers!

345
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,440
Gu Qiao,

346
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,590
you're here so early,

347
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,830
I happen to be making breakfast.

348
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,550
Let's eat

349
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,030
some songs together,

350
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,240
Come here.

351
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,110
Let me tell you something.

352
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,270
What is it?

353
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,590
So serious?

354
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,590
This is.

355
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,440
Here's your 2million.

356
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,070
Where did you get so much money?

357
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,510
My parents sold the house,

358
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,830
but they never

359
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,110
lived in an apartment.

360
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,400
You look greedy,

361
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,830
but you're actually living in an old house,

362
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,440
They can grow vegetables and flowers,

363
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,750
and they feel comfortable.

364
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,270
What about Gu Liang?

365
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,830
He

366
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,830
does a decent job in doing business,

367
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,000
I hope he can

368
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,790
keep it up.

369
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,160
Okay,

370
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,110
I'll take the money then.

371
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,200
Shu Mei won't sell it anyway.

372
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,030
There are plenty of places to use money in the future.

373
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,030
Sister is here.

374
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,960
Good morning.

375
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,960
Morning

376
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,920
Alright, let's go to work.

377
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,510
Honey,

378
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,830
I'm going to work.

379
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
Honey.

380
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,720
I gotta go, Mr. Fu.

381
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,440
All right,

382
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,920
Thank you for your hard work.

383
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,590
Shumei is fine now.

384
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,510
Mom's dream for so many years,

385
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
is still there.

386
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,160
As soon as you wake up,

387
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,070
I'll take you back to have a look.

388
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,640
Baona,

389
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,590
do you know that

390
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,960
when I come back this time,

391
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
I just want to stay here for a long time,

392
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,110
to stay with you.

393
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,680
You must wake up.

394
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
I want to watch you go to college.

395
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,830
I really regret it.

396
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,590
I think I really

397
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,310
neglected you before.

398
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,510
Baona,

399
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm sorry.

400
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,510
You must wake up.

401
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,550
Do you know?

402
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,270
As long as you can wake up,

403
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,310
I can do whatever you want.

404
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,960
Got it?

405
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,640
Doctor,

406
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,720
Doctor.

407
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,790
Doctor, how is my daughter?

408
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,880
It has stabilized.

409
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
Don't worry.

410
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,790
Gu Qiao,

411
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,790
where are you?

412
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,160
Ge Ge,

413
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm on my way.

414
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,440
But don't worry,

415
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,680
I'll be able to attend

416
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,270
your wedding

417
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,310
and wait for me.

418
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,880
Okay,

419
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,350
Be careful on your way.

420
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,160
I'll wait for you.

421
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,400
Yuan Ge,

422
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,160
Baona,

423
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,720
How is your recovery?

424
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,920
I feel like I'm fine now.

425
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,000
Everything is fine.

426
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
Why are you back?

427
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,070
You didn't even tell me.

428
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,310
Your wedding is such a big deal,

429
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,510
can we not come back?

430
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,310
My mom

431
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,880
specially booked

432
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
a flight ticket for last night,

433
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,440
I wanted to give you a surprise.

434
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,200
But I can't wait.

435
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
I want to see the bride first.

436
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,590
What about your mom?

437
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,350
I told you,

438
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,750
don't tell anyone.

439
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,830
I said it.

440
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,590
She said

441
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,270
she would be the emcee of your wedding,

442
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,640
I want to witness your happiness.

443
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,880
Really?

444
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Of course.

445
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,480
Look,

446
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,030
The outside is almost ready.

447
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,070
Let's go there.

448
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,310
Listen,

449
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,590
I saw Uncle Bingwen

450
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,960
outside just now.

451
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,480
Uncle Bingwen,

452
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,310
why do you call him uncle?

453
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Hello,

454
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,550
my name is Fu Mei,

455
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,510
I'm Yuan Ge's master,

456
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,790
and also her friend.

457
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,270
I'm also the leader of

458
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,880
the bride and groom today,

459
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,750
I remember,

460
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,720
when I first

461
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
met Yuan Ge,

462
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,830
She is also a student

463
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,270
who just graduated from college,

464
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,070
All these years,

465
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,880
I've been watching her,

466
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,030
You're getting better and better.

467
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,160
Mature,

468
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,720
she has

469
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,110
her own career now,

470
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,200
I met my own love again.

471
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,550
Yuan Ge is a very honest

472
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,350
and kind person,

473
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,680
She's simple,

474
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
and she's a

475
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
hard-working girl.

476
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,200
In fact, in our time,

477
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
the better a woman,

478
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
The harder it will be.

479
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,400
It's hard to balance

480
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,750
career and marriage well.

481
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,720
Now,

482
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,510
Yuan Ge has done it.

483
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,550
She can balance the two successfully.

484
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,030
Not only because of

485
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,200
the progress of this era,

486
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I believe that

487
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,550
she has also put in

488
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,110
a lot of efforts,

489
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,110
That's why we've achieved what we've achieved today.

490
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,830
Today, here,

491
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,160
I can witness with my own eyes

492
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,240
that she can enter the marriage hall.

493
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,750
I'm really happier

494
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,400
than a mom.

495
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,510
Here,

496
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,510
I'd like to thank you again

497
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,510
from the bottom of my heart.

498
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400
Bridegroom and bride,

499
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,350
thank them for their great help.

500
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,400
Because of their hard work

501
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,510
and hard work,

502
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So that we can keep our company

503
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,720
in order.

504
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,750
If it weren't for them,

505
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,310
I wouldn't have made a decision

506
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,350
and made the time,

507
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,160
To share family happiness

508
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,110
with my daughter.

509
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,030
So here,

510
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
I sincerely wish you,

511
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,030
The bride and groom,

512
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,310
Hundred,

513
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,720
Wish you a harmonious union in a hundred years,

514
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,110
and tie the knot forever.

515
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,240
Now, please give us

516
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,590
a big round of applause,

517
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,680
Welcome the bride and groom!

518
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,070
Bingwen,

519
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,400
hurry up, too.

520
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,760
Please exchange rings with the bride and groom.

521
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,920
Yuan Zong Hua,

522
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,070
Thank you.

523
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,920
Honey.

524
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,150
You know what?

525
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,880
Actually,

526
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,760
I've always been grateful.

527
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,280
Be nice to me unconditionally.

528
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,030
You like me unconditionally.

529
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,550
Because sometimes I'm so grateful.

530
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,550
So instead,

531
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,920
I don't know

532
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,800
how to express it to you.

533
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,630
Obviously, most of the time,

534
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,320
it's cute to see you being silly.

535
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,840
But I always

536
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,190
dislike you so much.

537
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,000
I think

538
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,070
I really want to be with you forever.

539
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,840
But I'm always duplicitous.

540
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,960
He said I love work more.

541
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,840
Thank you.

542
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
You can tolerate my character.

543
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,480
Thank you.

544
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,670
It can help me

545
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,070
learn how to love,

546
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,150
who has never known how to love.

547
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,360
Thank you.

548
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,400
to appear in my life.

549
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,230
Do you still remember

550
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,800
the confession of the end of the world?

551
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,960
At that time, you told me,

552
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,880
can

553
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,400
Spend the last minute

554
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,230
in the world

555
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,440
with the one you love,

556
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,070
is the most romantic.

557
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
But today I want to say,

558
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,800
Mr. Du,

559
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,190
For the rest of my life,

560
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,320
I can have every second of you.

561
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,920
are the most romantic

562
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,360
Okay,

563
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,630
Okay, okay.

564
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,190
Okay,

565
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,920
Okay, okay.

566
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,440
There used to be an old saying,

567
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,440
"Give a rose to a person. ",

568
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,760
My hands have lingering fragrance.

569
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,360
Now let's ask the bride

570
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,400
to hold the beautiful flower in her hand,

571
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,800
Share it with everyone.

572
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,670
I hope she can

573
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,030
continue her happiness.

574
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,480
Keep passing.

575
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,840
Let's go,

576
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,880
Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yuan,

577

580
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,360

00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,110

Here, here.

585
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,400
Give me a minute.

586
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,440
Give it to me this time.

587
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,070
Hurry up.

588
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,510
Don't take it from me.

589
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,760
Look at us.

590
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,840
This way.

591
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,000
Here,

592
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,800

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,440
This way.

594
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,280
Come to me.

595
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,230
Here, Mr. Yuan.

596
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:29,760
Mr. Yuan,

597
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,840
Mr. Yuan, here,

598
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,320
This way

599
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,000
Who is it?

600
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,070
back

601
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,760
Who is it?
