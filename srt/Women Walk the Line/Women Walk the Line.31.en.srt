1
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,840
Tell me why

2
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,959
he didn't even say hello.

3
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,799
So I left.

4
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,560
Maybe something happened?

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,799
Then you should answer the phone.

6
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,079
Since I've been looking for him for a long time,

7
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,959
maybe he didn't

8
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,040
want to trouble you.

9
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,959
I took him to the hospital.

10
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,560
There's no need to bother.

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,879
What a strange guy.

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,319
What did the doctor say?

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,599
He said that next week,

14
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,960
he had to have a review,

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Don't worry.

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll take him there.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,919
Thank you, Mr. Du.

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
You know how hard it is for me,

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
so I'll deal with it with instant noodles,

20
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,919
What do you want?

21
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,039
Okay,

22
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,240
As for the cooperation of the hotel,

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
let Gu Qiao report it.

24
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,400
I've submitted

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
my proposal

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
to the person in charge of Huamei Hotel.

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,879
But he has a problem,

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
that is, the shower gel

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,159
and body lotion of the hotel,

30
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,759
Its demand,

31
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,240
in fact, is greater than skin care products,

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,039
What about

33
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,319
the brands they want to work with?

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,599
It can be done in one step.

35
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,000
I think

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,840
according to

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
the demand of Huamei Hotel,

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,639
We're launching a body series,

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Gu Qiao,

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
You know a product,

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,319
from R & D to launch,

42
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,439
How long will it take?

43
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,400
And do you know how much manpower,

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
material resources

45
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,800
and financial resources are involved?

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,919
We're not going to

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
target a collaboration,

48
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,000
To develop a product that is not

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
within the scope of the plan at all,

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,599
Not only that, but from R & D

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
to testing,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
This is a lot of money.

53
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,240
Besides,

54
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,039
it's very likely that the cost

55
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,840
will hit Shui Piao.

56
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,800
Body building is really not

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
what Li Meng is good at,

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,000
We're not planning

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,039
to get into bodybuilding either,

60
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,759
What if we find

61
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,000
a big-name factory agent?

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
I don't recommend it.

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,080
Since Li Meng

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,319
wants to take the high-end route.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Then we have to be responsible for

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
all our product lines,

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,960
I don't really recommend finding a factory label,

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,960
because if

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,319
something goes wrong with the quality,

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,879
Instead, we lose more than we gain.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,039
I've thought about

72
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,080
everything you said.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,840
So,

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,759
I came up with a plan,

75
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,680
You can have a look.

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,800
This is a comparison of the ingredients

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,079
of a big-name facial cleanser and shower gel,

78
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,000
And the following one,

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
is the composition comparison

80
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
between the anti-aging series lotion

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,079
and the high-end body lotion,

82
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,399
In fact, from the comparison chart,

83
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,240
we can see that

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
the difference between these two ingredients

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
is not particularly great.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,839
So I'm

87
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,079
known to all,

88
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,199
Facial cleanser can be used

89
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,040
as shower gel.

90
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,240
But the question is,

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,759
what is the price of facial cleanser?

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,279
What's the price of the shower gel?

93
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,480
If the ingredients of shower gel

94
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,399
and facial cleanser

95
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,319
are the same,

96
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,839
Everyone went to buy shower gel.

97
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,800
Who will buy our facial cleanser?

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,439
It saves money and effort in the short term,

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,519
but in the long run,

100
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,360
It's not worth the loss.

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,079
Gu Qiao, what do you mean?

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Adjust the ingredients of facial cleanser

103
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
slightly.

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,759
It can complete the R & D to test phase in the

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
shortest time,

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,800
Yes,

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I did some research,

108
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,319
Where are all the big names?

109
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,600
After the brand matures,

110
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,279
they will launch their own skin care products,

111
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,439
or make-up series,

112
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,199
they don't do it to cut leeks,

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
But to occupy the relevant market.

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,079
It's also to prevent our own users,

115
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,600
because they use

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
other brands of make-up,

117
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,680
I think it's easy to use.

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,839
So as to choose

119
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,399
some skin care products of other people's families,

120
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,000
I lost my original client.

121
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,920
Of course,

122
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
this series,

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,279
It's impossible to launch it right away.

124
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,560
I'll get in touch

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,519
with the hotel first,

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,439
Let's give the customer feedback first.

127
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,839
And then there will be a period of

128
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,959
hunger marketing,

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,079
It depends.

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,439
We are slowly launching

131
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,040
our Li Meng Body Series.

132
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,519
I think this is a good direction.

133
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,839
What do you think?

134
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,959
If that's the case,

135
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,600
let's cooperate fully.

136
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,560
Hello, Manager Zhen,

137
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,879
our proposal,

138
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,920
The leader agreed.

139
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
I didn't expect Miss Gu

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,959
to be so efficient.

141
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,800
This is what I should do.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,439
When

143
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,759
do you have time?

144
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,519
You can visit

145
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,279
our company.

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,240
Let's talk about the contract.

147
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,879
Okay,

148
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll let you know

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
the exact time later.

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
Okay, bye.

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Gu Qiao,

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
you're amazing.

153
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,879
Gu Qiao,

154
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,680
what's wrong?

155
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
Xia Meng

156
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,199
told me just now,

157
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,759
As soon as your proposal came out,

158
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,879
even Mr. Yuan and Mr. Du were shocked.

159
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,439
In such a short time,

160
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,240
you've come up with such a good plan.

161
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,079
This is my job.

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,279
You're being humblebragging.

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,959
In fact,

164
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,240
everyone could have thought of this plan,

165
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,639
It's just that I brought it up first.

166
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,600
Don't be modest.

167
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,560
I praise you because,

168
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,439
I really think you're great.

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,839
You can teach me in the future.

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,519
Let's work hard together.

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
Let's work hard together.

172
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,759
Come on!

173
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,560
I'll go there then.

174
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,639
Okay, bye.

175
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,319
I want to do my best.

176
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,839
Go, go, go!

177
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
How are things going at the hotel?

178
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,360
Hey,

179
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,279
Ling Ling,

180
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,480
Dad,

181
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,160
When will Gu Qiao

182
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,319
come to see me.

183
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,360
I miss her.

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,639
I haven't seen her for a long time.

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,079
Dad misses her, too.

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,639
Lingling,

187
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,319
after Gu Qiao finishes her work,

188
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,839
He'll be back soon.

189
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,480
All right. I'll bear with it.

190
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Ling Ling is the best.

191
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,160
Goodbye.

192
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,319
Goodbye.

193
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,199
We've won in stages.

194
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,720
And we need by going up one flight of stairs.

195
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,959
Take care of Big Boss.

196
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,759
Come on!

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,639
Mr. Xiong,

198
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
this is Li Meng's quarterly report.

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,879
Take a look.

200
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,839
No problem.

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Just follow the procedure

202
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,240
and cooperate with them.

203
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
No problem. I'll get going.

204
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,959
By the way,

205
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,639
for some reason,

206
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,079
Shumei has a new matchmaker.

207
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,879
I think I should let you know,

208
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,879
about these executive matters,

209
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,120
You don't need to report to me.

210
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
It's the same no matter who it is.

211
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,159
Mr. Du,

212
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,840
I hope we can be like them,

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,679
Free and carefree.

214
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,279
Hey,

215
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,559
Is this a reward for me?

216
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Mr. Du, you're not satisfied?

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,720
It's a little different from what I thought.

218
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,279
It's a little ugly,

219
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
but I can accept it.

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Remember

221
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,559
to feed them,

222
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,080
Don't let them starve to death.

223
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll take good care of them.

224
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
Make them feel happy.

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,320
Constantly mating,

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,639
and finally filling up the fish tank.

227
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,639
Get back to work.

228
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,519
What's wrong?

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
Well,

230
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,360
do you know how to explain the plan?

231
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,799
According to the proposal,

232
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I went to a company for an interview,

233
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,840
They said that during the final interview,

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,799
we need to make a proposal.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,840
I don't know how to do it.

236
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
Can you teach me?

237
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
You went for an interview?

238
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,200
I used to think,

239
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,919
being an influencer can make a lot of money,

240
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,720
And you can be famous.

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,759
My dream

242
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,279
is to be an influencer,

243
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,559
But after more than a year,

244
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,759
I didn't make any money.

245
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,080
My body is broken,

246
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,279
and I don't have a background,

247
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,320
He has no special skills.

248
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,440
He's just so-so.

249
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,919
Fire is unlikely.

250
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,039
In the past,

251
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,279
I lied to myself.

252
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,840
I can't believe it,

253
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,200
but ever since you came here,

254
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,399
You work very hard

255
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,360
every day.

256
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,120
I thought,

257
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
shouldn't I find

258
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,399
a real job?

259
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,879
So I came to ask you for help.

260
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,080
Let's go.

261
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,919
Let me help you.

262
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,679
Really?

263
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,720
Come on.

264
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,759
Mr. Yuan,

265
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,559
you need to sign it.

266
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,639
After this season's new product development,

267
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,200
you'll be fine.

268
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,039
You can take a break.

269
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
This is what I should do.

271
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,559
Manager Zhen,

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
this is my revised plan,

273
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,159
Take a look.

274
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,639
If there's no problem,

275
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,279
we'll proceed with the signing as soon as possible.

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,039
Gu Qiao,

277
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,600
to be honest,

278
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
I agree with your plan.

279
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,720
But recently,

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
the top management of the group has changed a lot.

281
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,559
What about you?

282
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
I can make a decision directly.

283
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,639
But recently,

284
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,639
a new boss of mine, Mr. Chen,

285
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,080
came up to me,

286
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,120
So for your proposal,

287
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,759
I have to report it to him truthfully.

288
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,960
The specific decision-making power is also in his hands.

289
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
Just say what you want to say.

290
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,879
The one you met

291
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,679
last time.

292
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,919
Jeong Yeon Hee,

293
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,759
where was she before,

294
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,159
I've worked with Mr. Chen before,

295
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,080
so,

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Just pass me this time.

297
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,759
The two of them docked.

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Before I came here,

299
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,720
Mr. Chen also gave me a hint,

300
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,039
saying that his company,

301
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,120
It's obviously more in line with

302
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
the positioning of our hotel,

303
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,879
But don't worry,

304
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,679
I'll go back,

305
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,960
I will fight for it again.

306
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,840
Thank you, Manager Zhen.

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,759
Of course.

308
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,279
Mr. Chen,

309
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,639
when we were in Shumei,

310
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,000
You are my client.

311
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,279
Now that we're here, Yu Na,

312
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,240
and we're working together,

313
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,399
It's fate.

314
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,480
We have to do it.

315
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,759
Of course.

316
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,919
This is fate.

317
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,159
Look,

318
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,759
today

319
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,919
Take it easy.

320
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,639
I want to

321
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,440
have more drinks with you.

322
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,879
But President Chen,

323
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,399
I just arrived in Yuna,

324
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,960
If you can't sign the contract,

325
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,799
you won't be able to explain it to the boss.

326
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,519
You should understand me.

327
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,039
Yeon-hee,

328
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,879
you want me to understand you,

329
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,960
You have to

330
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,919
show some sincerity.

331
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,200
Okay.

332
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Do you think this is OK?

333
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,799
Okay.

334
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,279
What do you think?

335
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,159
Let's

336
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,039
go upstairs later,

337
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,519
So I signed the contract.

338
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,200
I want to

339
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,679
have a few more drinks with you.

340
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,399
Come on,

341
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,320
Here's a toast

342
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,440
to you.

343
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,399
Just a toast

344
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
It's our destiny.

345
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,919
Hello, Manager Zhen,

346
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,519
Gu Qiao,

347
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,720
Sorry,

348
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm stuck in traffic right now.

349
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,720
Mr. Chen should usually

350
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,559
be in the hotel now,

351
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,039
Why don't you go find him first?

352
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,320
I've talked to the receptionist.

353
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,559
It's okay.

354
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,519
I'll wait for you.

355
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,240
-I'll go with you. -Okay,

356
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,279
okay,

357
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,279
See you later.

358
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,399
See you later.

359
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,799
Mr. Zhang,

360
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,480
the car has been arranged for you.

361
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,399
Okay,

362
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,279
Okay, let's proceed with

363
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,360
the project as usual.

364
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,240
If you need anything,

365
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
just contact me directly.

366
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,600
Thank you, Manager Hao.

367
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,480
See you at the office tomorrow.

368
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,159
Okay,

369
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay,

370
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,919
Sorry,

371
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,559
I have something else to do.

372
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,399
I won't see you off.

373
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,039
Okay,

374
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,960
The car is outside.

375
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:58,759
Take care.

376
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,200
Okay.

377
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,240
Why are you here?

378
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,080
Me

379
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,399
Of course I'm working.

380
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,720
Mr. Zhang,

381
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,919
slow down.

382
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm drunk.

384
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,279
Slow down.

385
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,159
It's okay, Mr. Chen.

386
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,519
No, no, no.

387
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm really, really fine.

388
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm really fine.

389
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm drunk.

390
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,279
It's okay.

391
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
You can go back first.

392
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,600
Look, I'm really fine.

393
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
Is that Jeong Yeon Hee?

394
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,960
No, no, no. You're drunk.

395
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Who's that man?

396
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,080
Let me walk you upstairs.

397
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
I think Mr. Chen

398
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,919
is looking for a room to rest.

399
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,399
Chen Shi Hua, the manager of this hotel,

400
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
I'm really fine.

401
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,480
-This way. -Slow

402
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,600
down.

403
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,759
Slow down if you're drunk.

404
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,519
Hey,

405
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,480
Gu Qiao,

406
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm so sorry.

407
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Mr. Chen called me just now,

408
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,279
saying that he went out temporarily.

409
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,120
Gosh,

410
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,840
I made you come all the way here for nothing.

411
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,519
I'm sorry,

412
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,559
how about another day?

413
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,320
It's okay.

414
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,559
Let's make an appointment another day.

415
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
What's wrong?

416
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,799
Come on, slow down.

417
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,319
I really don't need to go home by myself.

418
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,640
Me,

419
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,559
That won't do.

420
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm fine.

421
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,720
Take a break.

422
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm really fine.

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Then sign the contract.

424
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
I really didn't.

425
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,119
I'd better go home.

426
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,039
I'd better go home.

427
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,599
Come in.

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,519
This way.

429
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeon-hee,

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,319
what about this?

431
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,279
It's a necessary process for signing a contract,

432
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,119
without any foreplay?

433
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,440
How can it be interesting?

434
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,279
What are you doing?

435
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,759
Mr. Chen, don't be like this.

436
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,759
Don't be like this.

437
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,200
What are you doing?

438
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
Let go of me!

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Chen Shi Hua,

440
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,000
open the door!

441
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,039
Chen Shi Hua, open the door.

442
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,640
Chen Shi Hua, I know you're in there.

443
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,519
Open the door!

444
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,160
Chen Shi Hua,

445
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,079
I'll call the police if you keep doing this.

446
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,720
Open the door!

447
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,519
Open the door!

448
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,440
Open the door!

449
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,000
You bit me.

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,319
Chen Shi Hua, open the door

451
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,000
and come back.

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,039
Chen Shi Hua, open the door.

453
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,319
Are you okay?

454
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,240
Gu Qiao,

455
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,759
who are you?

456
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,319
Chen Shi Hua.

457
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,839
I'm fine.

458
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,799
-Your favorite hot cocoa. -I'm sorry,

459
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,839
Master.

460
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,599
Sorry to embarrass you.

461
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,599
You didn't do anything wrong to me.

462
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,319
You are sorry for yourself.

463
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,440
After graduating from college,

464
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,200
many of my classmates went back to their hometown.

465
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,359
Actually, my parents

466
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,000
also want me to be a teacher.

467
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,559
They said,

468
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
an out-of-town girl like me

469
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,240
with no background,

470
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,880
There is no way to gain

471
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,960
a firm foothold in Shanghai,

472
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,240
Not to mention

473
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
breaking into a world.

474
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,920
At that time, I was very confused,

475
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,519
until I met you in Shumei,

476
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,839
Not only did you teach me a lot,

477
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,880
but you also gave me a lot of hope.

478
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,960
And I thought,

479
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
if I work hard enough,

480
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,079
Is it possible to become

481
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,680
a good person like you?

482
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,839
That's why I didn't dare to slack off these years.

483
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,880
I dare not fall in love,

484
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,599
I work hard every day,

485
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,079
every minute and every second.

486
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,799
But then I found out.

487
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,599
It seems that no matter how hard I try,

488
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,079
there will always be some people,

489
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,519
I can easily

490
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,119
get everything I want.

491
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,240
And then my mentality is out of balance.

492
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Yanxi,

493
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,279
no one

494
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,839
can succeed easily.

495
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,599
A lot of what you see is easy,

496
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,400
in fact, they put more effort

497
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
behind their backs.

498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,119
In exchange for the result,

499
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,279
Shanghai doesn't lack the most,

500
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,119
For hard-working and outstanding people,

501
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,599
what is lacking is

502
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,359
ten years of perseverance.

503
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,680
I know I was wrong.

504
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,519
But this time,

505
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,000
there seems to be no chance

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
to change it.

507
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,799
When I was in Shu Mei,

508
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,359
it was because you were lenient,

509
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,039
I didn't tell my colleagues about me.

510
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,480
But this time,

511
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,039
I lost the big order of Huamei Hotel,

512
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,640
Shame yourself.

513
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,920
It's also embarrassing for the company.

514
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,640
I've been suspended

515
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
to reflect on myself.

516
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,599
In the final analysis,

517
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,640
you're also the victim.

518
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,279
In fact, failure in bidding

519
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,559
is the norm in the workplace,

520
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,200
Not this time.

521
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,880
Then try harder next time.

522
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,119
Such an inhuman company,

523
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,759
you don't have to miss it anymore.

524
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,319
It's really my fault.

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,240
I shouldn't have been jealous

526
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,839
with Gu Qiao in the first place, right?

527
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,799
If I had been

528
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,799
at my post,

529
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,839
If I had worked hard,

530
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,720
I wouldn't have met

531
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
what happened today.

532
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,119
Yanxi, if you think like this,

533
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,960
it's not a waste of your time.

534
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,920
How about

535
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,119
this? Take a good rest.

536
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
I believe with your ability,

537
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,519
you'll find

538
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,559
a better job soon.

539
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,880
If you need it next,

540
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,720
I'll write you a letter of introduction,

541
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,640
You're still nice to me, Master

542
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,960
By the way,

543
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,480
I've done a lot of bad things

544
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,240
to Gu Qiao before,

545
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,880
I really want to apologize to her.

546
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
And this time,

547
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,480
I also want to say thank you to her.

548
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,640
But I really don't know,

549
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,799
how to face her?

550
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,240
So, Master,

551
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,319
can you convey it for me?

552
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,079
Okay,

553
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,480
In fact, Gu Qiao

554
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,559
is not a narrow-minded person.

555
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,039
If there's a chance,

556
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,440
you can talk to her face to face.

557
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sure

558
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,559
she'll be very happy.

559
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,000
Seeing how you've changed now,

560
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,000
thank you, Master.

561
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,759
Master,

562
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,400
you must

563
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,880
take good care of yourself.

564
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,000
You have a bad stomach?

565
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,839
Remember to eat on time,

566
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,759
don't just focus on work.

567
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,920
You too.

568
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,920
You must take good care of yourself.

569
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,480
You can learn from Master's strengths,

570
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,400
but you don't need to learn from his weaknesses.

571
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,279
What's wrong?

572
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,119
Mr. Xiong,

573
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,720
Shi Wei's final payment

574
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,079
hasn't been settled yet.

575
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,640
Wasn't it supposed to be here last week?

576
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,599
What's going on?

577
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,519
It's because there's something wrong

578
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,279
with their spokesperson.

579
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,720
The product was boycotted.

580
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,920
We did a series of PR,

581
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,559
but because of the excessive fermentation of the incident,

582
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,720
It didn't work.

583
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,319
Now Shi Wei,

584
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,799
instead of paying us,

585
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
He even asked us to pay for it.

586
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,079
We've already helped them

587
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,480
recover a lot of losses.

588
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,519
If they insist on compensation,

589
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,480
let the company's team of lawyers

590
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,599
talk to them.

591
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,519
In order to do PR for them,

592
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,880
the company has already paid

593
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
80% of the money,

594
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,559
If Shi Wei doesn't have the money,

595
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,400
this money,

596
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,799
We have to pay for it ourselves.

597
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,319
Who is in charge of this project?

598
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,079
Robin and Shi Wei's brand director,

599
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,319
were originally thought to be taken back

600
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,480
by college classmates,

601
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,839
But unexpectedly,

602
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,200
their boss changed the brand director

603
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,720
in a fit of pique.

604
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,519
Robin didn't do it.

605
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,759
The new brand director,

606
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,240
he doesn't have to come to work tomorrow.

607
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:22,880
As for this matter,

608
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,720
you must follow up on it yourself.

609
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,640
Okay Mr. Xiong

610
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,000
Anything else?

611
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,440
Because of Shi Wei's incident,

612
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440
several big companies that originally wanted

613
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
to extend our contracts,

614
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,839
I'm in contact with Blue Eagle now.

615
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:53,839
Mr. Xiong,

616
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,200
David is going to pass the Light Division,

617
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,160
To acquire Shumei,

618
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,559
why don't you find a way

619
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,799
to seize this opportunity?

620
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,759
If we can hold

621
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,880
Borai's thighs,

622
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,680
Then all the problems

623
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,440
we have now

624
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,759
can be solved.

625
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,119
Mr. Xiong,

626
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,200
go back to work.

627
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay

628
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,559
Are you teasing the fish?

629
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,880
Tell me. What can I do for you?

630
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
You did well.

631
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,359
The company gave you a promotion.

632
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,240
Really?

633
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,279
All of them have passed.

634
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
You'll be Manager Gu from now on.

635
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Did you get a raise?

636
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,920
Look at you.

637
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,359
That's all I can do.

638
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,279
Tell me. Is it going up or not?

639
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,039
I don't know.

640
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,599
Don't you know you'll get paid

641
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,480
at the end of the month?

642
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,000
That's right.

643
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,079
I'll treat you to dinner when I get paid.

644
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm leaving.

645
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm not having dinner with you.

646
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,480
It's your treat and I'll pay for it.

647
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,440
Am I right?

648
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:55,720
David,

649
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,839
why are you here?

650
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,759
I seem to have heard that

651
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,960
some of your big clients,

652
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,319
I'm docking with Blue Eagle.

653
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,000
If you're here

654
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,920
to make fun of me,

655
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,559
I'm a little early.

656
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,640
Just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

657
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,640
I'm here to discuss cooperation with you

658
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,000
with great sincerity.

659
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,559
If you can convince Fu Mei,

660
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,720
sell Shumei to us.

661
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,359
All the sub-brands

662
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,359
of our Baolai Group,

663
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,680
In the next three years,

664
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
all the advertisements in the Asia-Pacific region,

665
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll leave it to your Guangke to pick it up.

666
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,880
What do you think?

667
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,559
Does it count as a timely help?

668
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Thank you for your kindness.

669
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,039
But there's nothing wrong

670
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,359
with Guangke at the moment.

671
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,759
If you need anything,

672
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
I'll tell you.

673
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,319
Why did I hear that

674
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,559
Maggie from Blue Eagle,

675
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,880
Du Bingwen from Shumei

676
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,240
is an old friend.

677
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,680
You said that

678
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,039
if this line is connected,

679
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,680
Acquiring Shumei,

680
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
isn't it easier?

681
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,200
When the time comes,

682
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,039
will the status of Blue Eagle and Guangke

683
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,839
be reordered?

684
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,039
Wait.

685
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,640
Nice shot.

686
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,559
I won't play anymore.

687
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,640
I haven't played with Mr. Fu for a long time,

688
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,799
and Mr. Fu's skills

689
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,039
are getting better and better.

690
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,440
I'm far from you.

691
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,559
I'm just here to learn from you.

692
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,480
Mr. Fu is too modest.

693
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,519
Last time I beat you by one stroke,

694
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,319
but this time,

695
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,359
Then you pulled it back.

696
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,759
No wonder everyone says,

697
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,519
as long as it's what Mr. Fu wants to do,

698
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,119
There's nothing you can't do.

699
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,359
Really?

700
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,599
You flatter me too much.

701
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,440
Li Meng

702
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
Isn't it the best proof?

703
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,319
What I expect from Li Juncheng.

704
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,359
It's more than that.

705
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,880
It depends on Mr. Xiong,

706
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,960
thank you for your help.

707
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,480
Of course.

708
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Mr. Fu,

709
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,079
what do you think

710
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,240
of Li Meng's next direction,

711
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
How should I go?

712
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,880
Mr. Xiong, what do you think?

713
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
Li Meng,

714
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,160
in such a short time,

715
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,079
to occupy the market

716
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,599
of domestic high-end brands,

717
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,599
But there will be bottlenecks

718
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,119
in the future.

719
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,480
I think why don't we strike while the iron is hot,

720
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,039
and let Li Yuan develop overseas,

721
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,200
Actually,

722
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,160
I have the same idea.

723
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,440
However, Li Meng

724
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,160
is not a big international player.

725
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,920
It will take quite a long time

726
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,400
if we want to fully expand

727
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,599
the market overseas.

728
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,240
What if there is a ready-made channel?

729
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,279
What kind of channel?

730
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,119
I didn't want to get involved

731
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,920
with Borai and Shumei,

732
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,680
But I did take over Li Juncheng.

733
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,359
First,

734
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,039
domestic high-end brands,

735
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,839
Of course, I want it

736
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,960
to go further.

737
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,160
If Borai

738
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,359
is willing to provide Li Meng with a channel

739
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,039
to enter the international market,

740
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:24,960
Mr. Fu,

741
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,200
are you willing to reconsider

742
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,000
the acquisition for Li Meng?

743
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
Mr. Xiong is here to be a lobbyist.

744
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,480
The offer you just gave me

745
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,680
is really attractive.

746
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,039
But I also have my own difficulties.

747
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,279
I understand.

748
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,440
After all, Shumei and Li Jingzhi,

749
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,559
were carefully cultivated by Mr. Fu.

750
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,200
It's really hard to choose.

751
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,279
But Shu Mei

752
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,519
has fallen into a bottleneck.

753
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,319
After all these years,

754
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,359
if there's a turning point,

755
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,400
Mr. Fu,

756
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,039
do you still know how to be Li Meng?

757
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,839
How about this,

758
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:11,920
Mr. Fu?

759
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
You can think about it.

760
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,960
Or send a reliable team

761
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,839
to study overseas,

762
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,359
How about

763
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,680
we decide again?

764
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,880
Mr. Xiong is really a smart

765
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,160
and careful negotiator,

766
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,640
Thank you.

767
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,480
Okay, I promise you.

768
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,400
I'll think it over.

769
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:41,839
Bingwen,

770
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,599
is your friend Sun Bin

771
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,480
still coming today?

772
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,720
He didn't answer the call.

773
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,680
You didn't reply to my text messages.

774
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,240
Did something happen?

775
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,359
Really?

776
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,839
I reminded him yesterday.

777
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,799
But his visit time

778
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,720
has passed today.

779
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm really sorry.

780
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,119
I'm sorry.

781
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,039
I'll go ask.

782
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,200
Goodbye.

783
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,400
Now in the market,

784
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
people in this position,

785
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,519
It's still very scarce.

786
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,720
But for another position,

787
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,920
we've already recruited someone.

788
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,079
I'm busy.

789
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,200
Mr. Du,

790
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,960
if you need anything,

791
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll be fine.

792
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,000
I can handle it myself.

793
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,200
Sister, let's continue.

794
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,000
So we will

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
follow the company's requirements,

796
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,519
Continue to post recruitment information.

797
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,440
Mr. Sun,

798
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,440
Mr. Du.

799
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,039
I heard from Dr. Yang,

800
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,920
you didn't go for the re-examination?

801
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm sorry.

802
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,319
You said you and Yuan Ge,

803
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,880
You made an appointment with such a good doctor for me.

804
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,039
This opportunity was wasted by me.

805
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,720
I heard that many stars

806
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,640
have to wait in line to see him?

807
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,279
That's not the point.

808
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,480
The point is that you're in a lot of pain,

809
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,039
Yuan Ge and I both want you

810
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,039
to get better soon.

811
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,559
Become the positive you

812
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,119
you used to be,

813
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,960
Well,

814
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,599
I've already made another appointment

815
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,200
with Dr. Yang,

816
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,519
You must go this time.

817
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,759
Don't be afraid.

818
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,519
Don't be stressed.

819
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,200
Just do some blood biochemistry,

820
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,199
electrophysiology,

821
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,679
Balabara or something like that.

822
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
I've asked around for you.

823
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,119
It doesn't hurt.

824
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,079
But after doing this,

825
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,280
Dr. Yang can accurately determine

826
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,000
your condition,

827
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,679
I'll give you a proper treatment plan.

828
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,599
So you must go.

829
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,159
Not for myself.

830
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,119
It's also for your mother,

831
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,679
okay?

832
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,239
Okay,

833
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,239
I'll go.

834
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,480
Mr. Du,

835
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,280
I haven't finished my work yet.

836
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
I have something to do.

837
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Get back to work.

838
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,000
Thank you.

839
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,400
I'll definitely go.

840
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,079
I'll wait for Dr. Yang's call.

841
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:13,679
Okay.

842
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,920
Hey,

843
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,639
Did you want to see me just now?

844
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,599
Sun Bin

845
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,880
didn't go to the psychiatrist today.

846
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
Why is he so

847
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,559
afraid to see a psychiatrist?

848
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:45,960
Didn't he make an appointment

849
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,039
with you yesterday?

850
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,360
If you ask me,

851
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,360
he's not sick at all.

852
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,000
That's why he's afraid to see a doctor.

853
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
I looked it up online,

854
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,159
saying it's normal for patients

855
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,920
with this kind of disease to resist seeing a doctor.

856
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,679
I made an appointment for him tomorrow.

857
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,360
If he goes there tomorrow,

858
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,199
I'll be narrow-minded,

859
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,079
I'm hanging up.

860
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Mr. Du,

861
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,280
you're here.

862
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,599
We've arrived.

863
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
I thought you weren't coming.

864
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,119
How could it be?

865
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,079
Since I've promised you,

866
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:28,719
I'll definitely come.

867
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Okay,

868
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,440
I'll go in with you.

869
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,800
Come on,

870
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,599
I don't think we need to do the examination.

871
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,599
I know you have something to say to me.

872
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,679
Just say it.

873
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,000
I was joking with you yesterday,

874
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,400
You still need to do a check-up.

875
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,360
There's no need for that.

876
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,840
What's the use of taking medicine alone?

877
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,079
You still need to see a doctor.

878
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,119
Ask the doctor to give you

879
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,920
a proper treatment plan, right?

880
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,599
These are common vitamins.

881
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,760
It's good for your health.

882
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,320
One, please.

883
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,000
You're pretending.

884
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,559
If I didn't pretend,

885
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:29,960
Yuan Ge wouldn't always

886
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,239
come out to accompany me.

887
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,239
What do you mean?

888
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,360
What do I mean?

889
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,639
You already knew it.

890
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,960
I like Yuan Ge.

891
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,280
I want to be with her.

892
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,199
When will you break up?

893
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,280
Du Bingwen, stop it!

894
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Good timing.

895
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,760
What are you doing?

896
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
He admitted himself just now

897
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,239
that depression is fake.

898
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,559
Sun Bin.

899
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,719
Mr. Du,

900
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,039
I know you don't like me.

901
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,199
But why did you frame me up?

902
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,000
Why are you humiliating me like this?

903
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,360
What are you talking about?

904
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,039
Did you just say

905
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,199
that the bottle

906
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,239
was filled with vitamins,

907
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,559
It's not for depression.

908
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,760
Yuan Ge, look,

909
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:36,840
I didn't.

910
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,480
Are you kidding me,

911
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:41,920
Du Bingwen?

912
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,400
Stop!

913
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,360
Are you a man?

914
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,960
Du Bingwen,

915
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:44,599
what are you doing?

916
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,320
If you're a man, admit it generously.

917
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
Let go!

918
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,880
Du Bingwen,

919
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,840
you said Sun Bin was pretending to be ill yesterday,

920
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,039
Now that Sun Bin is here,

921
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,480
what do you want?

922
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,440
You brat.

923
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,599
You set up a trap for me today,

924
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,239
right?

925
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,199
Sun Bin,

926
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,159
Sun Bin,

927
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,519
Are you okay?

928
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:12,719
Let's go.

929
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,960
I'll take you to the doctor.

930
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's go.

931
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,800
Why didn't you close the door?

932
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,920
Ge Ge

933
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,760
I had a fight with Du Bingwen.

934
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,920
Tell me,
