1
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,480
Brother,

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,439
Gu Liang,

3
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm sorry,

4
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,120
We just had a meeting,

5
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,840
Sit down,

6
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,079
It's okay. I understand.

7
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,239
Those who can do it work harder.

8
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,640
What?

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,959
Why did you suddenly

10
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,879
come to see me?

11
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,000
It's nothing.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
I just wanted to talk to you

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,159
about my sister,

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,159
Brother, you don't know?

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
When I was little,

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
my sister was very kind to me.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,799
She dotes on me for everything.

18
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,199
What's there to eat?

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,599
Just let me eat it.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,639
Our relationship is so good

21
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,840
that we have nothing to say.

22
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,400
Except for those few years in college,

23
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,400
we've never been apart.

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,719
But now that she comes to Shanghai alone,

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,039
I don't feel at ease.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
Gu Qiao is

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
a very emotional person indeed.

28
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,360
Brother,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,159
You must like my sister.

30
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,039
Needless to say,

31
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,080
I can tell.

32
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,039
When my sister came to Shanghai alone,

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
my parents and I

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
were really worried.

35
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,400
But when I saw

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,319
how nice you were to my sister,

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,319
I'm relieved.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,520
Of course.

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,719
When I first saw you,

40
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,919
I thought you were very responsible.

41
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,560
Really?

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,560
I think

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,879
you can take good care of my sister.

44
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,199
Brother, don't you know that

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,719
these days, my sister,

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
It's really not good at all.

47
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,360
She was cheated by her ex-husband,

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,840
For me

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
He's in debt for 2 million yuan.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
I think,

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,759
I'm the younger brother.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
I should do something for her.

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
I also worked hard to make money,

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,800
so I wanted to help her reduce her burden.

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,120
But,

56
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,319
But who knows?

57
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,719
Forget it. Forget it.

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,560
If there's anything

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,319
I can do for you,

60
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599
Just tell me.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,919
Actually, it's not a big deal.

62
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,080
Well,

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,319
I started a business with my friend,

64
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,560
There's a problem with the funding.

65
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,840
I need a sum of money.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,479
turn over

67
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,199
How much is it?

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,400
100, 000 yuan.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,759
Give me the card number.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,560
Later,

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll ask the secretary to pay you.

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Okay?

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
No,

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,800
Well,

75
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,560
Not enough.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,399
No, no, no,

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,279
not that,

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,240
Well,

79
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,199
can you

80
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,759
lend me cash?

81
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,600
My bank card is frozen.

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,480
You.

83
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,959
If you call it in,

84
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,399
you'll return it directly to the bank.

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay, no problem.

86
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,240
Really?

87
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,120
Brother, don't worry.

88
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,079
When I get over it,

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,600
I'll definitely pay you back.

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,319
No rush.

91
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,879
Are you Gu Qiao's brother?

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,399
Your business is my business.

93
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,319
Brother,

94
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,519
What you said is so good.

95
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:54,839
Really

96
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,560
If the real family doesn't talk to each other,

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,759
I'll definitely tell my parents when I get back,

98
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,839
Let them rest assured.

99
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,720
My sister really

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,920
found a good man.

101
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,439
By the way, brother,

102
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,720
there's one more thing,

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Well,

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
about the money I borrowed,

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Can you not tell my sister for now?

106
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,160
She has too much self-esteem.

107
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,519
If she finds out,

108
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,560
Just

109
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,560
Don't worry.

110
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,959
I won't tell her.

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Thank you so much, brother.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,879
Thank you, brother.

113
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,639
Hello, sister.

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
I'm going back.

115
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,879
Take good care of yourself.

116
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,279
Don't just focus on work,

117
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,480
remember to eat more, okay?

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,519
If you get along well with Yuan,

119
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,120
she is the leader of the company after all.

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Don't act like you did when you were little,

121
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,480
okay?

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
Did you really go back?

123
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Yeah,

124
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,319
I've been thinking about it all night,

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,199
I really shouldn't have borrowed money from you.

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,839
It's not easy for you

127
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,680
to be alone in Shanghai.

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,399
What about your business?

129
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:51,959
It's okay.

130
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll figure something out.

131
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,480
Well, I'll pack up first.

132
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm hanging up.

133
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,279
You have to come back often

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,639
to see your parents. Bye.

135
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Ge Ge,

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
did you borrow money from Gu Liang?

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,680
No.

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,560
I really didn't.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
I really didn't.

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,279
Gu Liang is short of money again?

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
He asked me to borrow money,

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
but I didn't give him a penny.

143
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,399
But suddenly he called me

144
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,439
and said he was going back to his hometown,

145
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,279
And he told me not to worry about the money.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,959
Well,

147
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,680
Maybe he really

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
understands your difficulties.

149
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't you know

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,319
my brother well?

151
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,040
A fox may grow gray, but never good.

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,959
But in Shanghai,

153
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
except for you,

154
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
He doesn't know anyone else.

155
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,279
Ge Ge, ask for a leave

156
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,120
for me. I need to go out.

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,879
Gu Qiao.

158
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Gu Liang

159
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,480
Sis,

160
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,639
Why are you here?

161
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,160
I can take a taxi myself.

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,959
You don't need to see me off.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,439
Maybe

164
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,560
you borrowed money from Xiong Qiming.

165
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,519
No.

166
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,000
How could I borrow money from him?

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,720
Didn't you come to Shanghai

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
just for money?

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,839
How could you leave without money?

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
I told you,

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
I'm here to see you.

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,639
The second is to borrow money.

173
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Since you don't have any money,

174
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,879
I'll figure it out myself.

175
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,399
Then why did you add him on WeChat?

176
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,120
Me,

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
I think he's pretty good.

178
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
I just want to set you up.

179
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,439
Sis,

180
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,439
I really didn't borrow money

181
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,040
from him. Don't worry.

182
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,800
Go back to work.

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
I still have a car to drive.

184
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,040
Gu Liang

185
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,680
Sis,

186
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,959
What are you doing?

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
What's in the bag?

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Dirty clothes, dirty pants and so on,

189
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
I took them back to wash them. Sister,

190
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,920
Gu Liang, open it for me.

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Sister, don't be like this.

192
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
Gu Liang, let go. No,

193
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,319
no, no.

194
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,839
Sister, sister,

195
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,680
don't be like this.

196
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,120
You.

197
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,959
Sister,

198
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,199
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,240
Sister, don't be angry.

200
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,839
I did borrow the money

201
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,480
from Xiong Qiming. Yes,

202
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,959
But I promise I'll pay you back.

203
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,639
Don't worry.

204
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,159
He gave it to me.

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,320
I really need Qian urgently.

206
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,919
He's also very loyal,

207
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,480
he's better than that

208
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,919
jerk brother-in-law before me,

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,720
It's much stronger.

210
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,879
Your conscience was eaten by a dog.

211
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,080
It's not enough to sell me for 2 million,

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,559
but you have to sell me again, right?

213
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,759
Sis,

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
Sister.

215
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Gu Qiao,

216
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,480
what's wrong?

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
This is the money my brother borrowed from you.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,679
Count it.

219
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,480
If it's missing,

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,159
I'll make it up to you.

221
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,639
What happened?

222
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm sorry,

223
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,559
because my brother,

224
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
I've troubled you.

225
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,720
I promise.

226
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,639
It won't happen again.

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Gu Qiao,

228
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,000
you misunderstood.

229
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Think of this money

230
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
as my investment in your brother,

231
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,519
It's not too late for him to pay me back

232
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,639
when he makes money in the future.

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,320
Mr. Xiong,

234
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,799
do you really think he can make money?

235
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,039
I don't believe it.

236
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,519
How can I make you believe it?

237
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,039
I know.

238
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
For my sake,

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
you lent him the money.

240
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,559
But this money,

241
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,559
I have to pay you back.

242
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,080
Gu Qiao,

243
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,159
don't be so clear with me.

244
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,480
I just want to help you.

245
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,279
Mr. Xiong,

246
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,159
you and I took a leave of absence,

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,519
I have to go back to the company.

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,799
Gu Liang borrowed money from Xiong Qiming.

250
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,360
But I have to come back.

251
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,480
I gave it back to him.

252
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,519
I thought

253
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,039
Gu Liang was here.

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,399
I have scruples.

255
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
But

256
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
when it happened,

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,399
Instead, I've become relaxed.

258
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
Gu Qiao,

259
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,000
until today,

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
I still think Xiong Qiming

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,639
is an unfathomable person.

262
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,080
But I think

263
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,159
he's sincere to you.

264
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,279
And more importantly,

265
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,120
I know.

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
You have fallen in love with him.

267
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Be brave if you like it.

268
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,720
So whatever decision

269
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
you make next.

270
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
I will support you.

271
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
It's all your fault.

272
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
You insisted on taking me to drink with you,

273
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
because you said you wanted to drink enough of Ben,

274
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,879
Then I went home and had another drink.

275
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,480
But you didn't stop me.

276
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,559
If I don't drink it, I don't love you.

277
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,759
Do I dare?

278
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,360
Okay,

279
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,320
I was wrong.

280
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,399
I'll get back to work.

281
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,360
Gu Qiao, come to my office.

282
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,480
What's wrong?

283
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,279
What's the secret

284
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,519
between you and Yuan Ge?

285
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm your boss.

286
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,159
I'm asking you

287
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
to tell me everything.

288
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:03,759
Gu Qiao,

289
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,600
let's have lunch together.

290
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,759
I'm not hungry yet.

291
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,679
Eat it yourself.

292
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,799
Hello, your coffee.

293
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,120
Thank you.

294
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,519
You're welcome.

295
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,320
Enjoy your meal.

296
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,440
Sorry.

297
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:18,879
Sorry

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to keep you waiting.

299
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,200
No.

300
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
I just came here.

301
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,879
Today,

302
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,039
you took the initiative to ask me out.

303
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,519
He must have something important to say.

304
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,480
It's okay.

305
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,799
Go ahead.

306
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,519
I've done my best

307
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,399
to build up my mind.

308
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,120
About my brother lending you money,

309
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,200
I still want to tell you,

310
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,159
Sorry,

311
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,440
it's okay,

312
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,200
I understand.

313
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,919
In fact, when I was little,

314
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,080
my family was very poor.

315
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,679
My parents

316
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,120
favor boys over girls,

317
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
He dotes on my brother.

318
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,080
When I was

319
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
with my ex-husband,

320
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,159
My little brother

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,879
She asked my ex-husband for money,

322
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,720
for things,

323
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,240
include

324
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
The 2million I owe now,

325
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,440
is also the money

326
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,759
my parents took from my ex-husband,

327
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,639
Buy a house for my brother.

328
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:47,759
So when my brother

329
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,120
borrowed money from you,

330
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,480
I feel like

331
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
I'm back to where I started.

332
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,559
It's like

333
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,799
an infinite loop,

334
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,639
No matter how hard I tried,

335
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,399
I couldn't find the exit.

336
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
I can't help it.

337
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
This is my family.

338
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,440
No matter what they did,

339
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,400
they're still my family.

340
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,079
But,

341
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,279
I don't want to involve you in this.

342
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,119
Gu Qiao,

343
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
thank you for telling me this.

344
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,680
Actually,

345
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,680
I want to apologize to you.

346
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
On your birthday,

347
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,839
I was too anxious.

348
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,519
I didn't care about your feelings.

349
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
So on this matter,

350
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
let's not worry about it.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,519
Just pretend it never happened.

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,319
I went through

353
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,039
a very bad relationship before.

354
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,519
So,

355
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,039
I don't dare to

356
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,359
start another relationship easily.

357
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm scared.

358
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm afraid of getting hurt.

359
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,359
I'm afraid of repeating the same mistake.

360
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,960
But I have to admit,

361
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,559
Feeling

362
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,640
It's the last thing I can control.

363
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,839
I keep telling myself,

364
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,839
as long as you don't tell me,

365
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,720
We can always

366
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,480
be friends,

367
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,839
So when you asked me

368
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,160
that day,

369
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,759
I don't know how to answer.

370
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,039
So,

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
you like me,

372
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,359
Am I right?

373
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,359
Yes.

374
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,240
I like you.

375
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,480
before

376
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,039
I hesitate and struggle too.

377
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,680
But I've figured it out.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,880
If two people really like each other,

379
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
they should cherish this relationship.

380
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:37,759
Instead of

381
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,319
being bound by something

382
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,759
from the outside world,

383
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,359
Besides,

384
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,359
I also think that the current me,

385
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,960
I can handle those problems.

386
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
So in your heart,

387
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm not only the boss of Guangke

388
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
and Ling Ling's father,

389
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,759
Really?

390
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,000
We agreed to go out to watch a movie.

391
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,519
Why did you watch it at home?

392
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
Mr. Du has a problem with me,

393
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,680
no, no, no.

394
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
Come back, come back.

395
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,839
Why do you have a problem with it?

396
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,440
In this family,

397
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
I have no place.

398
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,839
Pick it up,

399
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,279
Ask him what he wants?

400
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,559
Hey,

401
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Yuan Ge,

402
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,559
I want to ask you a question,

403
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,759
Tell me,

404
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,279
what do people

405
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,799
live for?

406
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,599
What's wrong with you?

407
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,759
What happened?

408
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,920
I listened to you

409
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
and tried to solve the problem.

410
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,680
But things are getting more and more complicated,

411
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,519
I really don't know

412
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,519
what to do?

413
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,279
I feel like I'm really tired.

414
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,720
It's boring to live.

415
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,240
I don't know what I'm talking about.

416
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,480
You,

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,279
Are you free?

418
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,440
Can you come out?

419
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,839
Me,

420
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,839
Where are you?

421
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,400
Send me the address.

422
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,599
I'll be there later.

423
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,799
Don't say anything.

424
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,240
Where are you going?

425
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,759
I'll go with you.

426
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm really

427
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,000
sorry,

428
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,359
I didn't know you were together.

429
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,599
Sorry to bother you.

430
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,799
It's okay.

431
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,880
I won't disturb you.

432
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,960
It's what you said on the phone.

433
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
You startled us.

434
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,079
What's going on?

435
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,319
I am,

436
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,480
I am,

437
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,039
Tell me,

438
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,119
it's okay,

439
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
It's okay.

440
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,000
What would you like to drink?

441
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,440
I'll go get it.

442
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
Wait! Wait!

443
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,039
Get a bottle of wine for Mr. Sun and me,

444
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,720
and pick it out

445
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,599
Go,

446
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,119
Okay.

447
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,319
What?

448
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,039
I'm here.

449
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
It's not convenient to tell you.

450
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,799
No.

451
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,839
Mr. Du, don't get me wrong.

452
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,119
You don't want me to misunderstand.

453
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,240
You asked my girlfriend

454
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,920
out alone,

455
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,519
You even called her

456
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,000
so strangely.

457
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,599
But fortunately,

458
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,640
we have a good relationship foundation,

459
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,880
If it were an ordinary person,

460
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
there might be a big problem.

461
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,720
Mr. Du,

462
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm sorry,

463
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,119
I didn't think it through.

464
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,559
Last time when you said you were in Shanghai,

465
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,960
Yuan Ge was your only friend,

466
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,599
Let me tell you,

467
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,119
her friend is also my friend.

468
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,720
If you have any questions, you can come to me.

469
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,759
But you didn't look for it.

470
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,799
It seems that Mr. Sun

471
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,240
doesn't regard me as his friend?

472
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,200
No.

473
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,400
Mr. Du,

474
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,519
I really didn't.

475
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,880
Bin Sun

476
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,559
Mr. Sun,

477
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,319
let me propose a toast to you.

478
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,839
What are you talking about?

479
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,400
I care about him.

480
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Mr. Sun, are you worried

481
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
about your girlfriend?

482
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,599
Yes.

483
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,880
Yuan Ge has told me,

484
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,240
isn't it just a love affair?

485
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
What's the big deal?

486
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,279
There are so many good girls in Shanghai,

487
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,440
you don't know,

488
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,079
When I chased Yuan Ge back then,

489
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,920
it was so tragic.

490
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,599
If I were like this with you,

491
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,799
I wouldn't have lived.

492
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,680
Am I right?

493
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,960
Guys,

494
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
be strong.

495
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,759
What do you like, Mr. Sun?

496
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,319
Let me introduce one to you.

497
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,920
Don't bother, Mr. Du.

498
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't bother.

499
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,839
We have all kinds of products in our company.

500
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,920
You like tall ones, short ones,

501
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,799
fat ones, thin ones,

502
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,359
You're more mature.

503
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,319
There's something more meaningful,

504
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:05,960
and everything.

505
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,920
I really don't need it.

506
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,160
All right,

507
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,240
stop talking.

508
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,759
Who do you think

509
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,400
is more suitable for Mr. Sun in our company?

510
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,279
Think about it.

511
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Let's see if we're thinking the same thing.

512
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,880
Yuan Ge,

513
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,680
Mr. Du,

514
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,720
I have something else to do.

515
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,359
I'll get going.

516
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,079
Bin Sun

517
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,599
Didn't I ask you to stop talking?

518
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
Didn't you notice that

519
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,160
he's not in the right state?

520
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,000
What's wrong?

521
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,359
Forget it. I'll tell you the truth,

522
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,400
Actually, Sun Bin has depression,

523
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,319
depression,

524
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,640
Really?

525
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,240
I saw the medicine he took that day.

526
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,039
I looked it up online.

527
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,319
This is called smiling depression.

528
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,319
On the surface,

529
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,519
you're actually hiding the patient

530
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,319
who has the disease,

531
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,359
He might be suicidal indeed.

532
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,279
Then.

533
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
As for other people's privacy,

535
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,640
I can't just tell them,

536
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,400
He told me

537
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,519
not to tell anyone.

538
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,400
Goodbye.

539
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:08,920
Goodbye.

540
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,880
About the Light Branch Docking,

541
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,160
about the Light Branch Docking,

542
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,519
I want someone else to do it.

543
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,799
After all,

544
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,720
feelings are feelings,

545
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,359
Work is work.

546
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,200
I'll listen to you.

547
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,759
I'll go in first.

548
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Go to bed early.

549
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,680
Depression?

550
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,039
You're sick.

551
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,039
Do you think I look like him?

552
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,920
Sun Bin,

553
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,559
he's looking for my sister-in-law,

554
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,559
I even went there today,

555
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,680
and pouted him.

556
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,400
Don't tell me you really have this

557
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,720
smiling depression,

558
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,799
This is the first time

559
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,759
I've heard of it. What is this?

560
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,720
Leave him alone.

561
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,200
I don't want to.

562
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,200
I don't care. He just pesters your sister-in-law.

563
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,400
How can I ignore it?

564
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:54,960
This person

565
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,279
is just uneasy and kind-hearted,

566
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,559
Do you think it says

567
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
depression?

568
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,079
He usually

569
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,720
refuses to communicate with the society.

570
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,200
What kind of social fear.

571
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,559
I'm sure he didn't.

572
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:08,920
He doesn't seem to have one.

573
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,960
Right?

574
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,319
He pretended to be ill on purpose.

575
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,519
The drunkard doesn't mean to drink.

576
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,119
Stop guessing.

577
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,359
What if she does have one?

578
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,720
Don't you know a friend,

579
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,599
a doctor?

580
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,960
Take him to have a check-up.

581
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,119
That's right.

582
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,720
Didn't you find it out after checking it out?

583
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,000
That's right.

584
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,319
Look,

585
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,839
love can deceive people.

586
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,960
If you lose your mind,

587
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,119
is it you?

588
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,480
Did Sun Bin contact you later?

589
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,119
What's wrong?

590
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,519
It suddenly occurred to me

591
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,359
that I have a friend,

592
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,599
It's a psychiatrist.

593
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,720
I can make an appointment for him,

594
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,759
Let him go and have a look.

595
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,640
I'm afraid he won't.

596
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,319
My friend

597
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,119
is very good abroad,

598
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,359
If he really

599
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,359
has depression,

600
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,039
My friend,

601
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,839
I'm sure he can help.

602
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
Smiling depression,

603
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,680
right, right, right.

604
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,319
But I think

605
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,160
he's been taking medicine too,

606
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,119
He told me that

607
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,680
he had seen a doctor.

608
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,680
Okay,

609
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,920
I'll ask him first,

610
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay,

611
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,599
I'm going to make an appointment with the doctor.

612
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,279
Sorry

613
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,039
for being late.

614
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:42,680
It's okay.

615
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,440
I just arrived.

616
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,079
Yuan Ge didn't come?

617
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,640
Something came up in the company,

618
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
so she couldn't leave.

619
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,160
Thank you.

620
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,480
What's the big deal?

621
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,519
Sorry about last time,

622
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,920
I didn't know you were not feeling well.

623
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:55,799
It's okay. You're doing this

624
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
for my own good.

625
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,119
My friend is

626
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,039
very professional,

627
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,400
I had a bad day

628
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,359
at work.

629
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,720
He helped me with psychological counseling,

630
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,880
so I treated him as my friend.

631
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,559
Relax,

632
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,160
Here we are

633
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,960
Bingwen is here.

634
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,960
Come on.

635
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,319
Let me introduce you.

636
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,279
-Hello, Mr. Sun. -Hello,

637
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Mr. Sun.

638
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,599
Mr. Sun, please sit down for a while.

639
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,400
Come on. I'll take you to a seat.

640
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,720
Come on,

641
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,880
Bingwen,

642
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Mr. Sun is my patient,

643
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,440
I have to protect his privacy.

644
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,119
I understand.

645
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,880
Mr. Sun, don't be nervous.

646
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,400
It's just like chatting with friends,

647
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,079
That's enough.

648
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,680
Okay,

649
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:38,920
How about this?

650
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,519
I have a psychometric table here,

651
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,279
Fill it out.

652
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,960
Let me have a preliminary understanding

653
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,559
of your situation,

654
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,839
Let's talk further.

655
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:46,960
Use this.

656
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,000
Don't worry.

657
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll wait here.

658
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,559
I'll let you know if anything happens.

659
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,559
Okay,

660
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,960
See you at the office later.

661
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:15,759
Okay,

662
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:16,880
Goodbye.

663
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,240
It's over.

664
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,160
What do you think?

665
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,799
I need to go to the bathroom first.

666
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,720
Go ahead.

667
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,240
Over there.

668
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,200
I'll wait for you here.

669
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,680
What do you think?

670
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,759
I asked him to do a set of test questions,

671
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,799
but it didn't work very well.

672
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
What do you mean?

673
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,440
In the test he did,

674
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,799
there were many hidden items,

675
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,480
I tried to talk to him,

676
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,559
but he didn't want to talk to me.

677
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,640
Hidden item,

678
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,200
is he depressed or not?

679
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,200
Maybe some patients

680
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
lack trust in me.

681
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,000
It's an instinctive form

682
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,079
of self-protection,

683
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,840
So it's hard to tell

684
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,159
if he's depressed or not?

685
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,519
Yes,

686
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,039
we need to do further tests.

687
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,440
So that I can answer you accurately.

688
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,480
Bingwen,

689
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,440
how do I feel,

690
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,880
Are you questioning your friend?

691
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,480
No.

692
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
I just care too much about him.

693
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,960
Don't worry.

694
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,920
What about me?

695
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,880
I've made an appointment with him.

696
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:33,639
Ask him to do further tests

697
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,920
in a week.

698
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,639
When the results come out,

699
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,719
I'll work out

700
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,079
a complete treatment plan for him.

701
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,639
Okay,

702
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,199
thank you.

703
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,679
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

704
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,239
Okay,

705
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,000
Goodbye.

706
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,559
See you next time.

707
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,079
Goodbye.

708
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,159
I'm sorry

709
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,239
for the number you dialed,

710
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,679
I can't get through.

711
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,119
Please redial later.

712
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,199
Are you free for dinner

713
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,239
this weekend?

714
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Ling Ling asked me to tell you

715
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,760
that she misses you.

716
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,039
Okay.

717
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,960
I just got a new project,

718
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,280
and for some time to come,

719
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,119
It might be very busy.

720
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
Tell Ling Ling for me,

721
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,519
As soon as there's progress in the project,

722
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,760
I'll visit her.

723
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
No problem.

724
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,920
Ling Ling asked me to tell you

725
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,920
that she believes you.

726
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,119
Come on!

727
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,400
Hello,

728
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,360
Manager Zhen.

729
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,159
We finally meet.

730
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,039
I'm Gu Qiao from Shu Mei.

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,639
Please have a seat.

732
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,519
I didn't expect that

733
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,199
the person in charge of Li's Mansion,

734
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,000
She's a young

735
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,280
and pretty girl.

736
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,519
This is my card.

737
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:05,880
Okay.

738
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,039
Tell me.

739
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,039
What do you have in mind?

740
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,280
This is my proposal.

741
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,440
You can take a look at it first.

742
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,480
No need to look at it.

743
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,440
The proposal is fancy,

744
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
and it's generally useless.

745
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,239
To be honest,

746
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,360
as far as I know,

747
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,920
Huamei's first hotel.

748
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,039
Founded in Switzerland,

749
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,199
and since then,

750
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,000
It has become

751
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
the hotel of choice for many business people.

752
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
And our Li Runze

753
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,599
also originated in Switzerland.

754
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
This is in line with

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,039
the corporate culture of the hotel.

756
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,280
And I think,

757
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,079
but,

758
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,679
Li Meng's popularity,

759
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,519
I'm afraid, doesn't match

760
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,480
the popularity of our hotel.

761
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,480
As the saying goes,

762
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,480
the aroma of wine is not afraid of the deep alley,

763
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,960
The popularity of Li Juncheng,

764
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,199
will be opened sooner or later.

765
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,320
I believe,

766
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,519
if we work together,

767
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,320
It will be

768
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
a win-win situation.

769
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,159
But as far as I know,

770
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,400
you only make skin care products,

771
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,519
For our hotel suite,

772
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,280
what we need most now

773
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,960
is body lotion

774
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,400
and other body products.

775
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,559
Then according to

776
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,199
the needs of the hotel,

777
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,280
to launch a body-building series.

778
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,199
This series is only available in hotels,

779
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
not for sale

780
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,119
This thing

781
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Do you have the right to make decisions

782
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,760
as an assistant director?

783
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,079
Since I put forward this plan,

784
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,079
I will try to

785
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,320
convince my leader,

786
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,000
If you don't believe me,

787
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,440
we can put it in the contract,

788
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:40,719
Okay,

789
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,800
Then put it into the contract.

790
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:43,599
Hope

791
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,679
I'm sorry, Manager Zhen. I thought

792
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,920
there would be a traffic jam,

793
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,840
It turned out pretty well.

794
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,559
You're early.

795
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,239
Please have a seat.

796
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,480
Gu Qiao,

797
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,920
long time no see,

798
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Long time no see.

799
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
You know each other.

800
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,639
We're old acquaintances.

801
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah,

802
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,360
Yanxi used to work for

803
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,440
Shumei. Shumei is really talented.

804
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,840
How about this?

805
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:08,760
You guys go back

806
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
and I'll confirm

807
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,719
what happened just now,

808
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,239
Okay,

809
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,519
I'll wait for your good news.

810
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,360
It's fate.

811
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,280
I didn't expect to see you here again.

812
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,199
It's over so soon.

813
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm here today to deliver

814
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,199
the letter of intent for cooperation,

815
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,039
By the way,

816
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,559
this is my new business card.

817
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,559
Congratulations. You

818
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,639
got what you wanted,

819
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,039
It's all thanks to you.

820
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,840
What about you?

821
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,800
Mr. Du and Mr. Yuan

822
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,079
will protect you.

823
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,719
You should have been promoted and raised a long time ago, right?

824
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,039
I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you.

825
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,519
I'm just an assistant.

826
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
My car is here.

827
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,760
Do you need a ride?

828
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:16,599
No, thanks.

829
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,679
I'd better wait for the bus.

830
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,199
Take your time.
