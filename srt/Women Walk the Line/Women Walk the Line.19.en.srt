1
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,359
What did the doctor say?

2
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,959
The doctor said that

3
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,959
tomorrow's surgery,

4
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,359
There are still some risks.

5
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,319
He told me to be mentally prepared.

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,959
Then I'll come to accompany you tomorrow.

7
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,000
No need.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,480
Now the whole company

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,079
is busy with Li Yuan's business,

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Du Bingwen is on a business trip again.

11
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,560
You have so much work to do?

12
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,879
I can do it alone.

13
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,359
No matter how busy the work is,

14
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,280
I still need to ask for leave from the company

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
to accompany you.

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,640
I really don't need it.

17
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,639
I don't need to be polite to you.

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,439
Didn't you meet

19
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,840
a picturesque man,

20
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,360
Shall we talk about cooperation tomorrow?

21
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,199
We're not here right now.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,520
You have to stand on your own,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,639
this chance,

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
It's very important to you now.

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,719
But uncle will do it

26
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,240
tomorrow. No buts.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,360
If anything happens,

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,759
I'll call you.

29
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,599
Okay,

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,439
about Uncle's hospitalization,

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
Does Mr. Du know?

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,759
I haven't told him yet.

33
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,199
He's on a business trip.

34
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,719
I'm afraid he'll be distracted.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,199
Well,

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,560
it's getting late.

37
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,719
How about I send you back?

38
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,520
You don't need to see me off.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll take a taxi and go back.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,919
Stay here with me.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
Don't be so mean to him.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,599
He's the one who always blames me.

43
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,039
Both of you are the same.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,680
All right, I'm going to get my bag.

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,439
The number you dialed?

46
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,759
There's no answer for now.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,439
Please wait a moment.

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,919
Yuan Ge,

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,759
text me,

50
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,439
Maybe.

51
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,039
Honey,

52
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,240
why aren't you answering your phone?

53
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,840
What are you doing?

54
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,719
I miss you so much.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yuan Ge,

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
you'd better go back to sleep.

57
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,240
No need.

58
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll sleep here tonight.

59
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,920
It's cold at night.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Your blanket won't do,

61
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,839
Cover this.

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,279
I have a quilt.

63
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,920
Thank you, Dad.

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,319
Let me do it.

65
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,480
I can do it myself.

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
Please turn off the light for me.

67
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,519
I was in the shower just now.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
I didn't see it.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,399
You must be tired

70
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,639
after such a long flight.

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Go to bed early.

72
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,160
I miss you.

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,439
I've removed my makeup.

74
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
It's not convenient for video.

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Good night.

76
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,480
Dad.

77
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,920
Can't you sleep?

78
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,439
I can't fall asleep.

79
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,439
Dad.

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,160
Dad,

81
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,040
You.

82
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,079
Are you a little scared?

83
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,040
Why are you afraid of me?

84
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,120
Well,

85
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
you take the 180 thousand

86
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,560
in the passbook.

87
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,160
On the card

88
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,639
I can't remember the total amount of my pension

89
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,639
over the years.

90
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,920
You can check

91
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,240
the password. It's your birthday.

92
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,840
This is the real estate license of my hometown,

93
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,320
all my possessions.

94
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,320
I gave it all to you.

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm afraid... I'm afraid that

96
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,519
if,

97
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,399
What if,

98
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,679
what if you're the only one left,

99
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,799
There's no one-in-case.

100
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Sleep.

101
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,919
Really?

102
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a great honor

103
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to see you two now.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,919
Mr. Fu also said,

105
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,799
we must do a good job

106
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,799
in this event,

107
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,039
Including online and offline aspects,

108
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,879
if you need anything,

109
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,639
Tell me anytime.

110
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay,

111
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
Thank you, Miss Zheng.

112
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,440
Why are you here?

113
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,399
Mr. Fu attaches great importance

114
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,440
to this cooperation with Mr. Wang,

115
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,000
So,

116
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
he specially sent me to help you.

117
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,919
I'm early.

118
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,399
So come up first. Don't mind,

119
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,039
Mr. Wang,

120
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,960
Mr. Bai,

121
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,759
let me introduce to you,

122
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,279
This is my colleague Gu Qiao.

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,159
You just called me,

124
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,200
Miss Gu, right?

125
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Come on, have a seat.

126
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,399
Okay,

127
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,480
Ms. Zheng,

128
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,480
go on talking about

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,120
your cross-border marketing,

130
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,879
This is the proposal I made.

131
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,039
You can have a look.

132
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,679
Okay,

133
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,200
Not to mention,

134
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,080
the plan is really good.

135
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,440
It's quite creative.

136
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,720
What do you think?

137
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,960
In fact, these creative schemes

138
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
are similar.

139
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
The key depends on the ability

140
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,519
to perform later,

141
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
Where are my fans?

142
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,840
They are all too young.

143
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
And many of them are boys,

144
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,039
I guess they haven't heard

145
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,960
much about Shu Mei,

146
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,200
If I work with you,

147
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,679
I might get unfollowed.

148
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,600
How could I,

149
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
because of a business cooperation,

150
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
I just lost my fans.

151
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,159
What do you think about this?

152
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,279
Mr. Bai,

153
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,279
actually I'm in the company,

154
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
He has been in charge of marketing activities,

155
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
and he has met a lot of stars,

156
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,840
Search the internet and you'll find out.

157
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,759
For a long time,

158
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,799
we don't admire

159
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,799
excessive consumption of celebrities,

160
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,399
I want to use Shu Mei

161
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,879
as a media platform,

162
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Let the fans interact with the stars

163
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
they like better.

164
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,480
So,

165
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
if you're willing to work with us,

166
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,320
I will make sure that

167
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,240
you and your fans,

168
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,480
to better connect with each other.

169
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Let the country flourish,

170
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,360
I don't want to hear about these experiences,

171
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,200
I have something else to do.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,840
I'll get going.

173
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,919
You can talk to Mr. Wang

174
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,240
about the details.

175
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,200
No, no, no.

176
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,639
We haven't finished yet.

177
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,759
Have a seat.

178
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,000
Wait for me.

179
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Bai Xue.

180
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,960
As an assistant,

181
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
she doesn't really have the right to speak.

182
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,480
On the contrary, my master

183
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,720
is the vice president of the company.

184
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,039
You can make a decision.

185
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,559
If you communicate with me,

186
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,759
it will be more efficient.

187
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Okay,

188
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,080
I got it.

189
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,080
Mr. Wang,

190
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,919
Shu Mei

191
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,720
is here to cooperate with us

192
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,519
with full sincerity,

193
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,559
The previous plan

194
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,320
was just preliminary.

195
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,320
What do you need?

196
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,960
You can tell me,

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,759
I'll go back and discuss it

198
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,399
with my leader,

199
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Miss Gu is an assistant to

200
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,639
the brand director in the company, right?

201
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,480
As for the price,

202
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
it doesn't count if you say it.

203
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,879
I can discuss it

204
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,720
with our leader.

205
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
Report it to him.

206
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,440
There are leaders above the leader,

207
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,879
and there is one layer above the first floor.

208
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
It's too complicated.

209
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,159
Miss Zheng's master

210
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,639
is the actual person in charge of the company,

211
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,039
Right?

212
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,919
In my opinion,

213
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll leave this matter to you.

214
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,519
What about the details?

215
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Docking with Xiao Liu,

216
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,120
no problem.

217
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,879
I like things to be simple.

218
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,200
You guys talk.

219
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,879
I'll go over there.

220
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,600
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,960
Mr. Fu doesn't even know

222
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,879
about this cooperation,

223
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,720
You said that, didn't you?

224
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,600
Mr. Du is on a business trip,

225
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,639
and my master is busy too,

226
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,159
Shumei's future.

227
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,720
I won't let you practice casually.

228
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,240
Who said I practiced?

229
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,320
Also,

230
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,639
what exactly did you say to Mr. Wang?

231
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,360
His attitude towards me

232
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
changed 180 degrees,

233
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,879
I'm just telling him some facts.

234
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
Don't you know

235
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,399
the truth?

236
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,879
You don't know what to say.

237
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,279
If you frame me up like this,

238
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,919
it won't do any good

239
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,879
to our cooperation.

240
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,519
You are who you are and I am who I am.

241
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Didn't you teach me that?

242
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,919
Come in

243
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,679
You don't have to sit so stiff.

244
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,440
How did it go

245
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,200
with Jiangshan Ruhua?

246
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,960
Here's the thing.

247
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,679
Where's Mr. Wang?

248
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm actually very satisfied with my plan.

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
It's just that the writer himself

250
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
has some concerns,

251
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
She's worried that her fans

252
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,679
won't support

253
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,440
our cross-border marketing,

254
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
"Fans" don't support it.

255
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,399
In fact, in this case,

256
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,639
President Fu, it's actually not difficult.

257
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,879
Cartoonists

258
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,639
don't want to be regarded as businessmen,

259
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,359
They all care about their work.

260
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,079
It was sold as a commodity.

261
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,000
So I think,

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,079
we want to make it happen.

263
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,400
Why can't we do it in front of Bai Xue,

264
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
tomorrow night,

265
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,200
I've asked Mr. Wang

266
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,880
out for dinner alone,

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,759
I'm sure it will work.

268
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,279
You're smart enough

269
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,119
to be Ge Zi's disciple,

270
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,599
Gu Qiao,

271
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,519
you should cooperate well with Yanxi.

272
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,799
Try your best.

273
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,960
Sign the contract tomorrow night.

274
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,880
Okay, don't worry.

275
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,400
Don't worry.

276
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,559
There's nothing else.

277
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,519
Go back to your work.

278
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,640
There are thousands of defenses,

279
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
but it's hard to guard against thieves.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,119
What do you mean?

281
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,640
I've heard a lot of gossip

282
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,000
about you and Manager Zheng recently,

283
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,359
Manager Zheng is thoughtful,

284
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,160
and you can't compare with her professionally.

285
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,480
In terms of scheming,

286
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
you'll suffer even more.

287
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,920
Your kindness must be sharp.

288
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,359
If she keeps tolerating it,

289
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,440
she will only push her luck.

290
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,759
Thank you.

291
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,319
The color of lipstick today

292
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,240
is particularly beautiful.

293
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,960
You have a good taste.

294
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:18,880
Uncle.

295
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,160
You didn't reply to my messages.

296
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,640
How was the surgery?

297
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,079
The doctor said it's going well,

298
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,559
but it needs to

299
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,759
be observed for a while.

300
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,079
That's fine.

301
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,480
How's it going over there?

302
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,759
I'll do it myself.

303
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,000
Of course it's fine.

304
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Really?

305
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
The cartoonist and her boss

306
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,720
like my proposal very much.

307
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,440
But at this price,

308
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
we need to grind it a bit more.

309
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,160
Go for it.

310
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,559
Don't worry.

311
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,680
Just stay here

312
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
and take good care of uncle.

313
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,480
If there's anything at work,

314
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll tell you.

315
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,279
You must have been hungry all day.

316
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,559
I'll buy you something to eat.

317
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,000
Honey,

318
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,279
book me a better restaurant

319
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,200
tonight,

320
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
Any taboos?

321
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,799
Mr. Wang is from Northeast China.

322
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,720
Order northeast food.

323
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,200
Okay,

324
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,119
Book a private room.

325
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,039
Okay,

326
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,720
Thank you.

327
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,240
Miss Gu Qiao,

328
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,119
you don't have to go if you have something to do.

329
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,359
Hello, Mr. Wang,

330
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,559
I'm Miss Gu Qiao Gu

331
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,519
from Shu Mei,

332
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,799
We heard that

333
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,119
you sing very well.

334
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
So I discussed it

335
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,279
with Manager Zheng,

336
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,079
If we don't go to that hotel,

337
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,680
let's meet in the karaoke room instead.

338
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:08,759
Okay.

339
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,799
It's been a long time since I sang.

340
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Let's open our voices together,

341
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,039
Okay,

342
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,599
I'll send you the address.

343
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,480
See you tonight,

344
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,119
Okay,

345
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,480
Okay, see you tonight.

346
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,319
Goodbye.

347
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,400
Yuan,

348
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,119
don't you know that these two days,

349
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,559
I'm telling you, your daughter

350
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,319
didn't eat well and didn't sleep well.

351
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,160
You're busy all the time.

352
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,640
You're such a dutiful child.

353
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,480
I know.

354
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Aunt Sun,

355
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,920
your son is also

356
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,359
a dutiful child,

357
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,960
Both of us

358
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,599
are blessed.

359
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,680
I'm telling you,

360
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,119
my son is good at everything.

361
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,200
But I haven't even

362
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,119
found a date yet.

363
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,079
I was so worried.

364
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
Don't worry.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,119
There's a lot of social pressure right now,

366
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,799
Where are the youngsters?

367
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,279
He has a lot of ideas

368
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,039
and a good taste,

369
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,039
It's useless for us parents

370
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,119
to be anxious.

371
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,000
This phone is not your daughter's.

372
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,119
It's ringing.

373
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,640
Well,

374
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,400
Yuan Ge,

375
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,640
Yuan,

376
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,680
it's for you,

377
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,680
Dad.

378
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,079
I think it's the company's number.

379
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm done with the surgery.

380
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,839
Go back to work.

381
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,519
Dad, it's not the phone number of the company.

382
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,599
Dad, I'll go out and pick it up.

383
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,599
Hey,

384
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,799
I'm in Guangzhou.

385
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,119
I'm done with Beijing,

386
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,799
honey. Thank you.

387
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,839
Did you miss me?

388
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,440
Yes

389
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
Say yes,

390
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,279
I think

391
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,279
is everything going well with your company?

392
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,519
Everything is going well here.

393
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,960
Don't worry too much about me.

394
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,319
Okay,

395
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Wait for me.

396
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,160
I'll be back soon.

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,599
Okay,

398
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,440
Take care.

399
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,880
When you come back,

400
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,039
remember to call me.

401
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Okay, I'll hang up now.

402
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,599
Give me a kiss.

403
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,359
Yuan, does your daughter have a date?

404
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,799
Not really.

405
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:24,960
Really?

406
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,359
Well,

407
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,759
neither does my son.

408
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,680
If it were you,

409
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,680
if your daughter

410
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
and my son,

411
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
If it can be healed, we …

412
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,960
We … This

413
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,440
is fate.

414
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,279
Am I right?

415
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,279
Mom,

416
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,960
Why do you ask such a question?

417
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,279
It's embarrassing for Uncle Yuan.

418
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,119
No.

419
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,319
Mom, tell me,

420
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,240
right? Ask me,

421
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,640
uncle. I'm sorry,

422
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,519
My mom is joking.

423
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,480
Please don't mind.

424
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,200
It's okay.

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,039
I'm serious.

426
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,319
Enjoy your meal.

427
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:54,920
And he said,

428
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,720
I'll do it myself.

429
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
Here, have some.

430
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,799
I'll fetch some water.

431
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,880
Here you are

432
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
What do you think?

433
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,359
Is it possible?

434
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,000
Your son

435
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,559
is a good boy.

436
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,720
But about the kids,

437
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,960
I think,

438
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,480
It's up to them

439
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,400
to make their own choice.

440
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,319
As parents, sometimes,

441
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:31,200
the more we help, the more chaos we get.

442
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,000
I won't.

443
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,599
That's true.

444
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,680
Let it be, right?

445
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,359
Yes.

446
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,240
Miss Zheng, would you like to order?

447
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,319
Just a moment.

448
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,359
My guest hasn't come yet.

449
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,160
Thank you.

450
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,720
Okay.

451
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,759
This song is really good.

452
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,200
That's right.

453
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,799
Going far away,

454
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
I want to go to the end of the years with you,

455
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,599
Use the rest of your life

456
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,240
as a bag. Come on. Drink.

457
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,079
Come on,

458
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,720
have a drink.

459
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
Mr. Wang,

460
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,200
I respect you.

461
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,720
You don't know,

462
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,799
when I first met you,

463
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,400
I was shocked.

464
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,000
I was thinking that

465
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,559
a copyright owner with a business mind

466
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,400
like you,

467
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Why are you in your 40 s and 50 s?

468
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,720
I didn't expect that,

469
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,359
I'm so young

470
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,079
and handsome.

471
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Is it that exaggerated?

472
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,279
Your mouth

473
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,480
is

474
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,759
so sweet.

475
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,839
Here, let me propose a toast to you.

476
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,680
Okay,

477
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,680
Cheers.

478
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,119
Come on.

479
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,079
Cheers.

480
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,480
Cheers. Cheers.

481
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,319
Cheers.

482
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,720
Cheers. Come on.

483
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,039
Okay,

484
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,880
Cheers,

485
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,680
Cheers,

486
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
What a good drinker!

487
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,039
Good job.

488
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,759
The number you dialed?

489
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,279
There's no answer for now.

490
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,480
Miss Zheng,

491
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
are you ready to order?

492
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,839
Don't rush me, okay?

493
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,119
I'm more anxious than you.

494
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,839
I'm really sorry.

495
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,000
Because we're closing

496
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
in an hour.

497
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,359
Got it.

498
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,839
Hello, Mr. Xiong.

499
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,920
I don't think

500
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,359
you've come to teach Ling Ling recently.

501
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,000
Did you run into any difficulties?

502
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,759
I'm really sorry.

503
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,799
I've been busy lately.

504
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,960
I forgot to ask for leave.

505
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,200
It's okay.

506
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,000
It's just,

507
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,799
Ling Ling misses you very much,

508
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,000
so please say sorry

509
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,720
to Ling Ling for me,

510
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,640
I miss her too.

511
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,279
When I'm done with my work,

512
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,640
I'll go visit her.

513
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,319
Okay,

514
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,000
Miss Gu, are you still out there?

515
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,119
I'm talking about cooperation

516
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,960
with a comic book company?

517
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,480
Be careful at this late hour.

518
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Don't drink too much.

519
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,359
Get back to work.

520
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
Have a good rest.

521
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,799
Late

522
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,319
Hey, Sherry,

523
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,680
check it for me,

524
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,559
Shu Mei is talking about

525
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,599
cooperation

526
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,400
with a comic book company recently.

527
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,920
Thank you for your perseverance.

528
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,960
I didn't let love be just an outline.

529
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,799
Who is it?

530
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,720
From now on, I'm no longer confused.

531
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,839
Mr. Wang

532
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,839
can grasp the phone number,

533
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,759
Thank you for your perseverance.

534
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,160
Okay,

535
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,160
Come on, let's do it together.

536
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,920
Let me do it.

537
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,119
Thank you for your perseverance.

538
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,960
Hello, Mr. Wang.

539
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,839
Hurry up, please.

540
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,440
Cheers!

541
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,880
Thank you for your perseverance.

542
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,359
Don't let love be just an outline,

543
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,200
playing dice,

544
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,240
From now on, I'm no longer confused.

545
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
Mr. Wang, let me propose a toast

546
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,359
to you. Okay,

547
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:07,880
Okay,

548
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,319
Here you are.

549
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,799
Okay,

550
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,559
You know what?

551
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,720
I've always wanted a brother

552
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
to protect me,

553
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,759
When I saw you today,

554
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,519
I felt like,

555
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,000
You must be my brother.

556
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,359
I'm your good sister.

557
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,519
So you can't have

558
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,880
any other thoughts about me.

559
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,440
Right?

560
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
You think too much.

561
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,680
Am I that kind of person?

562
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,119
I just said it,

563
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,039
and you just listened to it,

564
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,920
Cheers.

565
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,319
Clouds convey the feeling that

566
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,039
the wind blows away the uneasiness.

567
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Brother, please sing.

568
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,119
I'll go to the bathroom.

569
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:36,839
Okay,

570
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,079
Just like you and me.

571
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,640
You are my scenery.

572
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,599
The stars hanging in the night sky

573
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
are your eyes,

574
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,279
I can't put it down,

575
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,960
your eyes,

576
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,799
Yuan,

577
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,680
you are the vice president of the company.

578
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,400
You have to take care of a lot of people.

579
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
It's okay. In fact,

580
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,000
every department

581
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,240
has a person in charge,

582
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
I just need to take care of the person in charge.

583
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,160
That's enough.

584
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,680
How much do you earn in a month?

585
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
Aunt, it's hard to say.

586
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,200
Because our salary

587
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
is linked to performance.

588
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,480
It's different every month.

589
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,839
20 thousand, right?

590
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,400
Slow down, uncle.

591
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,359
Okay,

592
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:20,759
slow down.

593
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,440
Be careful.

594
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,039
Dad,

595
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,039
Be careful.

596
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
Close the door.

597
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
Thanks to Sun.

598
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
I almost slipped in there.

599
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,759
Be careful.

600
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,839
Be careful.

601
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,160
Slow down.

602
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,920
Okay. Be careful

603
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,920
with the needle roller.

604
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,599
Be careful.

605
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,559
Okay.

606
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:36,960
Hands

607
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,519
It's okay.

608
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:38,880
Come on,

609
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,279
Okay,

610
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,960
Be careful.

611
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,160
All right,

612
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
don't move.

613
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,880
Go get some rest.

614
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,759
Sun Bin, thank you.

615
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,000
Thank you.

616
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
Don't be so polite.

617
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Of course.

618
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,440
You're great.

619
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,359
Good evening.

620
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,319
What do you think? I bought it especially for you?

621
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,240
Brother Wang,

622
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,640
we'll have a good time working together.

623
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,519
I'll do it.

624
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,400
Me too.

625
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,880
Make yourself at home.

626
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,359
Good drinker.

627
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,079
Come on.

628
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,039
I'll fight to the death with you!

629
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,119
Come on,

630
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,680
Mr. Wang,

631
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,880
my waist is so thin.

632
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,759
Come on,

633
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,920
Let's go together.

634
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,519
Come on, sister. Come with me.

635
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,200
Come on, sister. Come with me.

636
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:33,519
Come on.

637
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,079
Come on, sis. Drink

638
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,000
and feed Brother Wang.

639
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,800
Hello, Miss Gu.

640
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,199
Come to the company tomorrow.

641
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,039
Sign the contract.

642
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,639
What did you say?

643
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,760
Tomorrow,

644
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,760
come to the company

645
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
with the contract,

646
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,119
I can only recognize you.

647
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,440
I won't recognize anyone else.

648
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,039
I've seen a lot of girls like Jeong Yeon Hee,

649
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,559
your brother Wang,

650
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,119
Except for a little trick behind his back,

651
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,599
he can't do anything else.

652
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,880
You did a great job

653
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,079
on this case.

654
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,239
It's really good.

655
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,440
It's settled.

656
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
See you tomorrow.

657
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,400
Let's see each other.

658
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,000
How much did you drink?

659
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,119
Another 300 rounds.

660
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,039
Ge Ge, I'm telling you,

661
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,920
I got it done today.

662
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,000
The picturesque Mr. Wang,

663
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm going to sign the contract tomorrow.

664
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
Do you think I'm good?

665
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,159
Awesome.

666
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,280
Come on, let's go.

667
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,760
Let me take you home.

668
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,039
No.

669
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,760
I want to stay here.

670
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,880
Go home with you

671
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,519
and uncle.

672
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,039
Yuan Ge,

673
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,239
can I help you?

674
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
Don't disturb them.

675
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,480
Sorry

676
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,360
to disturb you.

677
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:07,880
No need.

678
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
Please

679
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,480
look after my dad for me.

680
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,280
I'll send her back first.

681
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,079
No problem.

682
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,559
Thank you.

683
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,880
Thank you.

684
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,519
Thank you.

685
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,719
Okay, goodbye,

686
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,119
Auntie.

687
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,039
All right, let's go.

688
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,199
Gu Qiao,

689
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,320
go for it!

690
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,119
Do you know Ge Ge?

691
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,360
You're right.

692
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,360
In a big city like Shanghai,

693
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,840
No.

694
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,400
No matter where you are,

695
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,159
you have to rely on your own strength.

696
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,440
Playing tricks

697
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,280
is really useless.

698
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,199
Look at me,

699
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,079
look at me,

700
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,719
With his own strength,

701
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,760
he managed to get the cooperation

702
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,400
of the popular cartoonist Bai Xue,

703
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,800
Tell me,

704
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,440
am I good?

705
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,360
Yes

706
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,159
You're the best.

707
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,159
I'm the best.

708
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm the best.

709
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,400
Later,

710
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,639
we need to check the patient's condition

711
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,400
in Ward 3.

712
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,679
Okay,

713
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,199
got it?

714
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,519
Morning,

715
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,519
Good morning.

716
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,480
By the way,

717
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,400
was my dad okay yesterday?

718
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,480
It's okay. I just

719
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
woke up for two nights.

720
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,559
Thank you.

721
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,920
Sorry to trouble you again.

722
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,039
Don't be so polite

723
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,199
to me in the future.

724
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Otherwise, I really

725
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
don't know how to reply.

726
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,079
Okay,

727
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,800
You don't have to go down to make breakfast.

728
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,039
I brought it for you and auntie.

729
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,119
Here, take it.

730
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,159
Thank you so much.

731
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,440
Didn't you just tell me

732
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
not to be so polite?

733
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:42,960
Yes.

734
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,800
Let's go.

735
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,239
Let's go.

736
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,079
Yuan,

737
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm not praising my own son,

738
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,800
You live in the hospital too?

739
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,159
It's been a while.

740
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,280
My son's words and deeds.

741
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,159
You can see it.

742
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,079
Yes,

743
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,599
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

744
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,159
To have a degree,

745
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,280
the most important thing is filial piety,

746
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,760
Yes, yes.

747
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,679
Mom,

748
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:12,320
I'm here.

749
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,840
Uncle,

750
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,760
Yuan Ge bought you breakfast.

751
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,480
Really?

752
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,719
Yuan Ge, thank you.

753
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,639
You're welcome, Aunt Sun.

754
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,800
You should do it.

755
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,239
This kid is so nice.

756
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,360
When she's not around,

757
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,039
Sun always takes care of me,

758
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,840
This kid

759
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,119
is so nice.

760
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,159
Be careful.

761
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,559
Be careful.

762
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,480
OK. OK. OK. OK. OK.

763
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,360
Let me do it.

764
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,880
Dad,

765
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
After you finish eating,

766
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,320
I'll take you down for a walk.

767
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,840
I was thinking,

768
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,199
if you're busy at work today,

769
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,360
I can't come.

770
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,320
I want Sun to push me down.

771
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,639
Take a walk in the garden.

772
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,960
No problem. Anytime.

773
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,559
Bin Sun

774
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,519
Thank you.

775
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,679
Thank you.

776
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,559
Didn't we just make a deal?

777
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,360
No thanks.

778
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,880
It's okay.

779
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,840
You bought this congee so well.

780
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
For the sake of a list,

781
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,599
how could you do this to yourself?

782
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,719
Yes,

783
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,480
but it's understandable,

784
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,280
You said the business ability is not good,

785
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,280
but you still don't allow it.

786
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,519
In private,

787
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,880
I heard Gu Qiao

788
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,800
was sitting

789
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
on his lap last night.

790
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,519
It's disgusting to drink

791
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,960
cross-cupped wine with him.

792
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,840
What are you talking about?

793
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,079
Let's go.

794
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,400
It's nothing.

795
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,599
The whole company knows,

796
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,119
in order to cooperate with Snow White Company,

797
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,320
I drank and sang with his boss

798
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,280
last night,

799
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,400
You're still sitting on his lap.

800
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,119
Stop it.

801
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,360
No, she dares to do it.

802
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,039
Why can't I tell you?

803
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,079
It's not that simple.

804
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:55,679
You said that, didn't you?
