00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,686
Girl!

2
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,297
Miss, can I take the bottles?

3
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:49,493
Turn around.

4
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:57,508
You're beautiful.

5
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:58,811
Apply here.

6
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,574
Where?

7
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:02,644
Here at my club.

8
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:05,855
Just take a bath.

9
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,524
I'll get the bottles.

10
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,657
Come back to me later, okay?

11
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,061
Angge!

12
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,381
- Gelo.
- Let's go.

13
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,707
Who were you talking to?

14
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:28,353
I don't know her.

15
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,168
That's a lot.

16
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,690
Be careful.

17
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:37,874
- Oh!
- You're sitting there?

18
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,983
- How many kilos?
- One.

19
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:01,042
How about you, miss?
Are you with her?

20
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,363
Okay.

21
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,143
- Put it down. Hurry.
- Go on.

22
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:16,357
- How many?
- Two. So, in total, three.

23
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,937
- I'll head out first.
- Alright.

24
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:19,990
[background chatter]

25
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,509
Okay. Put it down.

26
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,551
That's it?

27
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:23,646
What the!

28
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,743
- Hey.
- Cassy!

29
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:27,890
What's up with you?
Where have you been?

30
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,309
It's so crowded here!

31
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,810
Son of a gun.

32
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,062
Cassy!

33
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:36,781
Hey!

34
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,150
- Mom might see us.
- She won't!

35
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,823
What's with you?
She's just around.

36
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:41,887
- No.
- Don't be so loud.

37
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,138
She won't be here for a while.

38
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,677
What's wrong with you?
What if mom catches us?

39
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:46,741
She won't.

40
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:47,786
What's with you?

41
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,001
Hurry up.

42
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:53,940
Hurry up.

43
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,625
Mom might catch us.

44
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,693
Why are you in such a rush?

45
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:57,724
She won't be here for a while.

46
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,504
But what if mom shows up?

47
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,584
It's fine.

48
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,071
Cassy!

49
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:04,157
What are you up to?
Where are you?

50
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,573
There are a lot of people here!

51
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,606
That's a lot!

52
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,344
Hey! Where are you?

53
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,849
It's already crowded here!

54
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,146
Son of a gun!

55
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:16,004
- Three kilos.
- Three kilos?

56
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,424
- Just this.
- Here, here!

57
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:18,979
- Here.
- Fourteen.

58
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,749
- Oh, here!
- This is good enough.

59
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:24,012
- One kilo.
- One kilo only.

60
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,346
That's cheap. Here.

61
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,402
So cheap. Don't you
have anything else?

62
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:31,512
Next time, bring some
scrap metal, okay!

63
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:32,663
Fine.

64
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:33,691
Okay.

65
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:36,565
What's that?

66
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,275
I'll just give you something.

67
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,467
Hurry up.

68
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,624
Gelo might see us.

69
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,497
I just have something to give you.

70
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,999
What's that?
Where did that come from?

71
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:57,736
- I just saw it there.
- Hurry up.

72
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,875
- It's beautiful.
- Hurry up already.

73
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,765
I am.

74
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,206
This one's really eager for me.

75
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,081
Hurry.

76
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:36,082
Wait. Why are you
in a rush?

77
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,055
My mom might catch us.

78
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:39,836
She won't be here
anytime soon.

79
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,881
- Three, okay?
- Come, let's go there.

80
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,084
Alright.

81
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:22,431
Here.

82
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,457
- What's that?
- Wait a moment.

83
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,005
I'll come back for more.
Don't get mad.

84
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,145
Hurry.

85
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:41,791
Hurry, please!

86
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:42,874
Shit!

87
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,440
Later, I'm making the most of it.

88
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,921
You've been gone a while.

89
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,281
And now you're
acting like that.

90
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:49,977
Shit.

91
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,720
Feels good?

92
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,167
Hurry up.

93
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:02,845
How much longer?

94
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,024
What?

95
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:05,682
Already? Seriously?

96
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,907
[background chatter]

97
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,384
This is very heavy.

98
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,272
Okay,

99
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:18,485
weigh it now.

100
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:20,887
Put it here.

101
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,520
Do I just put it here?

102
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:23,924
Alright, go ahead.

103
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,528
Hurry up, there are
still many in line.

104
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,918
Merchandise is cheap now.

105
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:29,944
No one is buying.

106
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,996
- What the heck.
- Look for copper.

107
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,886
So, your sales will be bigger.

108
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:34,911
Your income.

109
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,365
Son of a bitch!

110
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,393
Why did you blow it inside?

111
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:05,321
Sorry.

112
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,708
Geez, hurry up,
there are still many in line!

113
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,081
Quick.

114
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,277
That's okay! Look for copper,

115
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:14,561
so your sales will be bigger.

116
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,630
- Here it is, here it is.
- Okay.

117
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:16,531
- Oh hurry!
- Here it is, ma'am.

118
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,224
- Wait, this is iron.
- Okay.

119
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:19,858
Where did you go?

120
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:21,766
Just there.

121
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:24,719
Four? Bring more again, okay?
Four kilos.

122
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,040
I was asking for your help.

123
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,307
But you left me.

124
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:29,680
There's still no rice at home.

125
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,827
- Here it is already.
- Okay.

126
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,588
- Just this.
- It's just cheap.

127
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:34,215
We only got two
hundred pesos, and...

128
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:35,249
it seems...

129
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,523
This is a scam.

130
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:38,382
- I already paid for...
- Ma!

131
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:39,821
- Ma!
- Oh?

132
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:40,888
I'm leaving now, Ma.

133
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,056
- Okay.
- I'm going to school.

134
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,141
Come home early!

135
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,642
Hey! Why are you taking that?

136
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,886
- I have to go somewhere.
- Study hard, please!

137
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:49,981
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

138
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:51,838
- I'm leaving now, Ma.
- Oh, what?

139
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,066
- Here's my payment.
- You're getting me ripped off..

140
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,176
Oh my!

141
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,921
Next time,
get more, alright?

142
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:58,381
- Look for a lot of copper.
- There's already a lot of that.

143
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,987
- So your sales will be bigger.
- Let's go then!

144
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,195
- I already paid.
- Goods are cheap nowadays.

145
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,037
- Cheap!
- They're not complaining.

146
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,074
Curse you!

147
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,241
Here.

148
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:08,018
- Let's go, Angge!
- Wait for a while.

149
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,204
- I'm alone here.
- It's a loss though.

150
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,811
Cassy, what's up with you!

151
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,004
I'm here, madam.

152
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,984
What's wrong with you, kid!

153
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,649
There's so many
people in line!

154
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:17,942
I don't have anyone
helping me here!

155
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,802
- Fine!
- Help your mother.

156
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,167
- Fix your line.
- We've been waiting in our line...

157
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,235
My god!

158
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,175
No fighting in the line, okay?

159
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:26,983
There, who's next?

160
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:28,935
That's nothing.

161
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,370
Oh, Angge?

162
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,869
- Where are you going?
- Just there, Gelo.

163
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,207
You're going to
stay out late again.

164
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:32,291
Hey, Angge!

165
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,585
You can't get used
to going out.

166
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,878
Why not?

167
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,566
Because you're going
back to school again.

168
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,664
Really?

169
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,023
Thanks, Gelo!

170
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:00,556
I'll leave it to you as long as

171
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,131
you do your best
and don't waste what

172
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:05,698
we worked hard for.
You know life is tough.

173
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,344
So just let me do this

174
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:10,805
because once I'm studying,

175
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,100
this won't happen again.

176
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,851
You'll really do everything

177
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,475
to get want you want.
Alright then.

178
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,980
- Just be careful.
- Okay?

179
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,092
- So you agree?
- Go on, go on.

180
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,565
I don't want to...

181
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:27,600
You're staying out
late with Dario.

182
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,087
He doesn't have
any dreams anyway.

183
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:32,223
Okay, just be careful.

184
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:53,621
Thank you.

185
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,777
You know,

186
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,831
you're the first one
to give me flowers.

187
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:02,924
And you're the only one
I've given flowers to.

188
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
[sighs]

189
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,240
You know,

190
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:13,913
earlier,

191
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,151
My brother said that I can
go back to school again.

192
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:19,490
Great!

193
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:21,693
That's good then.

194
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,517
You've been dreaming
about going to school, right?

195
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:29,165
Yeah, and I can wear

196
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,422
my school uniform again.

197
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,228
And when I finish studying,

198
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:36,112
I want to be a nurse.

199
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:38,531
I want to work abroad.

200
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:40,075
I want to

201
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,165
buy my own house

202
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,369
and car.

203
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,558
Then we get married?

204
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,605
What?

205
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:50,251
What are you talking about?

206
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,313
Well...

207
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:54,856
You're crazy.

208
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:56,740
Give me a kiss.

209
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:57,773
Come here.

210
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,129
- What now?
- Here we go again.

211
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,783
- Just a kiss!
- You already had a lot.

212
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,147
This spot is good enough.

213
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:12,229
We can do it here!

214
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:13,751
What the heck!

215
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,413
- We just finished.
- Did we just finish?

216
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,364
Oh?

217
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:45,166
This is quite a lot, Gelo.

218
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:46,974
Is this what we saved up?

219
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,057
No, I just took it out

220
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:50,354
to count it.

221
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm also going to
change it to bills.

222
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,632
Thank you, Gelo.

223
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:05,600
I'll take care of you.

224
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,370
Just do your best.

225
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:38,663
Angge!

226
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,046
You can't waste

227
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,436
the opportunity because...

228
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,328
There are only a
few chances for us.

229
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:48,976
[sighs

230
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:50,342
Who knows.

231
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:52,123
If you get rich,

232
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,760
we can buy a house.

233
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,044
And eat delicious food.

234
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,478
Right?

235
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:08,352
What the!

236
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:09,946
Gelo's here!

237
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,989
Your brother is being
sentimental again.

238
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,668
This stupid idiot!

239
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,524
He won't stop
bothering my sister!

240
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:26,062
Damn you, bastard.

241
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,984
Come on! You're even smiling.

242
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,733
I'll punch you. Come on!

243
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:50,291
Angge!

244
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,242
Never ever let yourself

245
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:53,788
fall for that idiot's
charms, okay?

246
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,331
You won't gain
anything from him.

247
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:08,865
We can't eat scraps forever.

248
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:22,950
You clean there.

249
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:21,990
Thanks, by the way.

250
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:23,790
Why are you thanking me?

251
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:25,967
Nothing.

252
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:27,647
What is it?

253
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,081
Nothing really.

254
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:34,891
Why don't you say it?

255
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:36,937
It's nothing.

256
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:38,311
It's like...

257
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:41,047
I feel pretty lucky.

258
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:44,295
Even though I'm like this,
you're with me.

259
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,783
Stop being such a sad boy.

260
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,046
Alright, alright!

261
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,225
I just feel so lucky

262
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,151
because you're still with me.

263
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,283
Stop that, Dario,
we already talked about this.

264
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,283
Stop what?

265
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:13,691
I just said thank you,
is that wrong?

266
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,592
Dario, I don't like that.

267
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,745
This thing we're doing,

268
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:21,883
it's nothing.

269
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:24,224
Damn it.

270
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,392
What do you even call
what we're doing?

271
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:28,803
Huh?

272
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:31,293
Don't shut this down!

273
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:33,392
Who knows, maybe
this is nothing now,

274
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,863
but tomorrow...

275
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,341
You might suddenly
fall in love with me.

276
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,051
Or maybe tomorrow,

277
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,532
you'll suddenly like me.

278
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,284
Right?

279
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,067
No, it's not possible.

280
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,874
Nothing good will
come out of my life,

281
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,709
or your life
if we end up together.

282
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,025
Son of a bitch!

283
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,045
Screw you too!

284
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,086
Screw you!

285
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,534
You think you smell so good!

286
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,925
Damn you, you stink!

287
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,666
We smell the same, jerk!

288
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:58,292
You stink too.

289
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,413
Damn it! You talk like
you're someone special.

290
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,888
Screw you! So annoying!

291
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,062
What?

292
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:08,420
You stink, idiot!

293
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,793
You stink too!

294
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,567
And you're so short!

295
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,676
Acting like you're someone.

296
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:13,734
- Bitch.
- Damn you!

297
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,219
Go home already!

298
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:16,796
Jerk!

299
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,640
- You stink!
- Shorty!

300
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:23,535
Idiot!

301
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,614
You stink, idiot!

302
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:27,519
Annoying!

303
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:28,736
Tiny dick!

304
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,126
Screw you, no wonder
your breath stinks!

305
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,969
That damn bitch.

306
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:42,995
Damn, it's already late.

307
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:45,899
Good thing the killings
are over, or else,

308
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:47,189
your head would've
been blown off.

309
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,768
Let's talk tomorrow, Gelo.
You're drunk.

310
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:51,832
What do you mean tomorrow?

311
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:54,211
You're the one
coming home late

312
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:55,195
like a prostitute,

313
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,715
and now your lecturing me?

314
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,861
What? Were you
with that jerk again?

315
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:01,876
What?

316
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,393
Did you sleep with him?

317
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,729
What's it to you?

318
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:06,783
Are you my dad?

319
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:22,955
Do you like me,

320
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,981
Gelo?

321
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,018
Yes, Jessa.

322
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:27,598
I love you so much.

323
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,653
Damn you!

324
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,484
You bastards!

325
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:06,393
Damn you both!

326
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:10,389
How could you do
this to me, Angge?

327
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,544
How could you do this to me?

328
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:19,646
Here's more, sir.

329
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,640
What? You're good?

330
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,362
Damn, bro.

331
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,818
Huh?

332
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,330
Do you know why I
keep coming back here?

333
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:47,395
Because I had a classmate once.

334
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:50,259
Damn, I had a crush on her!

335
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:52,916
She was so smart.

336
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,076
And she even told me once,

337
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,223
she wanted to be a doctor.

338
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,933
But that never happened.

339
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,305
She was forced to choose.

340
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:09,131
Between studying, or...

341
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:12,420
selling her body

342
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:13,907
for her family.

343
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,011
Angge?

344
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:21,918
She doesn't have
to choose, bro.

345
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,546
I can support her education.

346
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,236
If I were you, Dario.

347
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,143
Stay away from the kid.

348
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,977
Let her take care of herself.

349
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:44,588
Bro,

350
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:47,729
I'm not going to
ruin your sister's life.

351
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,624
I love Angge.

352
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,265
And I won't let her
go down the wrong path.

353
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:54,923
I don't care

354
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:56,840
if you don't believe me.

355
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,414
But we're just the same.

356
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,385
We both just want
what's best for her.

357
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:02,096
I'll fight for her dreams.

358
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,420
I love her so much!

359
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:06,406
What will she do
with that, Dario?

360
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,923
Can she eat that?

361
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,179
Don't ruin the kid's life.

362
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:15,611
Angge wants to study.

363
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,099
Angge!

364
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,878
You haven't even
had breakfast yet.

365
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:53,521
Why are you throwing up?

366
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:57,380
Maybe I ate something
bad yesterday.

367
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:58,506
Ate something?

368
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,710
You're practically vomiting
your guts out there.

369
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:05,721
When was your last period?

370
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,963
Angge? When was your last period?

371
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:16,687
Answer me, you flirt!

372
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,801
Answer me, you flirt!

373
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,441
When was your last period?

374
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,229
Are you pregnant?

375
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,168
Are you pregnant?

376
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:43,530
Are you pregnant?

377
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,944
Are you pregnant?

378
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,296
Gelo!

379
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:51,307
Answer me! Are you pregnant?

380
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:54,133
Did something happen
between you and that fool?

381
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:57,166
- Gelo! I don't know.
- Son of a bitch!

382
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:00,757
Angge, I raised you right!

383
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:03,067
Damn it, you don't
know the hardship

384
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,511
of our life!

385
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,097
And now you're
acting like this!

386
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,174
Son of a bitch!

387
00:39:14,462 --> 00:39:16,084
- Sorry.
- Son of a bitch!

388
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:17,384
Sorry?

389
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:23,425
You know all the hardships
we go through, right Angge?

390
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:34,765
Son of a bitch!

391
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,033
You're so ungrateful!

392
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:39,129
You son of a bitch!

393
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:56,699
What are you listening to?

394
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:08,949
There's no music playing!

395
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,655
You're so weird!
What are you into?

396
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,681
Bad vibes?

397
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:14,475
Just stop talking,
you're so annoying.

398
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:20,368
Angge.

399
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:22,958
I'm here, okay?

400
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:25,588
I won't leave you.

401
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:27,695
I love you so much.

402
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm always here.

403
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:43,296
I was so irritated
with the guys earlier.

404
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:44,630
- So annoying.
- Just ignore them.

405
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,841
- They're touching me everywhere.
- Don't be too grumpy.

406
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,167
If only every touch,

407
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,844
they gave money, right?

408
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:51,951
We need this for the business.

409
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:53,614
We need to compromise.

410
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,031
Oh my.

411
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:56,475
Look, someone's there.

412
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:58,519
Oh! Hi!

413
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:00,021
Good thing you came back.

414
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,566
Come on, hurry!

415
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:04,959
I saw her outside

416
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:06,444
scavenging through the trash.

417
00:43:06,444 --> 00:43:07,487
Pretty, right?

418
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:08,904
- Beautiful girl!
- This will be a hit for us.

419
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:12,175
Come, hurry. Good thing
you changed your mind.

420
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,422
Come here.

421
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,454
How old is she, girl?
Is she old enough for us?

422
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,647
Still in high school.

423
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,166
Come on.

424
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:21,056
Come with me.

425
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:22,393
You know, you'll have
a lot of money here.

426
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:23,586
Teach her!

427
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:25,088
Just follow me.

428
00:43:25,113 --> 00:43:26,829
I've made a lot of
money here, you know.

429
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,147
Come, hurry.

430
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:29,692
Don't be shy.

431
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:31,232
- You're very young, ma'am.
- She'll teach you.

432
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:33,308
This will be a hit.

433
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:35,567
Are you okay?

434
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:37,350
- You'll make more money here.
- Let's go.

435
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,375
It's okay.

436
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,844
Come on.

437
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:21,476
You know it, right?

438
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,400
I chose this.

439
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,560
I picked the clean one.

440
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,614
There's no more trash.

441
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,927
That smell that
wouldn't go away

442
00:46:00,952 --> 00:46:02,443
even in my dreams.

443
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:05,322
I chose the soft bed.

444
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:07,939
I picked the clean restroom.

445
00:46:09,014 --> 00:46:10,147
Are you ready?

446
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:12,741
I choose not to
pick up trash anymore.

447
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:16,217
Smile now.

448
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:17,743
You look beautiful!

449
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:19,153
I chose to have money

450
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:21,138
and be cooled
by an electric fan.

451
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:22,682
Don't be afraid.

452
00:46:22,682 --> 00:46:24,115
Just stick with us.

453
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:26,961
To get to try the food I like.

454
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:30,273
Just follow us.

455
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:33,002
Money is easy here.

456
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:35,401
Just keep smiling.

457
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:38,086
Introduce yourself.

458
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,467
You just have to get
those perverts drunk.

459
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:43,409
I chose to be happy.

460
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:45,195
I chose this.

461
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:46,681
This is my decision.

462
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:47,790
It's mine.

463
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:48,958
So who are you

464
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,378
to judge me?

465
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:52,295
Could you dig
through garbage

466
00:46:52,336 --> 00:46:54,017
under the blazing sun?

467
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:55,834
It's only disgusting at first.

468
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,319
You'll get used to it too.

469
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:02,004
We're all dealers here, right?

470
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:06,011
What was your job before?

471
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,917
Did you gain anything from it?

472
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,535
Nothing, right?

473
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,439
Could you scramble
with dogs for mere scraps?

474
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:16,986
Would you be able to live

475
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:18,960
without aircon
and fresh water?

476
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:21,424
You'll have a new life.

477
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,118
Can you let go of
all your dreams?

478
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:26,120
Because life itself is a bitch

479
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,627
and won't let you be happy.

480
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:29,471
The old...

481
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:33,336
Angel will be gone.

482
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:39,567
Colonel!

483
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:40,985
- Hey.
- How are you?

484
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,387
Long time. Good thing
you visited my bar.

485
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:45,568
- You know it.
- I have a lot of new girls.

486
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:47,182
You'll be happy!

487
00:47:47,475 --> 00:47:49,059
Fresh. Just a moment.

488
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:50,436
Girls!

489
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:51,724
Come in, come in!

490
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:53,271
Hurry up!

491
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,668
They are all young, Colonel.

492
00:47:57,693 --> 00:47:58,708
Fresh.

493
00:48:00,217 --> 00:48:01,372
There's a student.

494
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:05,805
Smile, smile.

495
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:07,720
Wait, it seems like one is missing.

496
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:08,804
Where's the other one?

497
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:11,935
There she is, Colonel.

498
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:15,086
Can you abort
what you're carrying

499
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:17,071
because you don't
want it to starve?

500
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,029
Can you live with
the choice I made?

501
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:23,968
If you can't handle it,
then just look away.

502
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,030
Stop worrying about me.

503
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:27,486
Girls, it's okay now.
Go ahead.

504
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:28,971
Choose peace.

505
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,882
Choose to study.

506
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:33,311
Choose to work in an office.

507
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:35,867
Choose your pretty girlfriend.

508
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:37,673
Choose breakfast in bed.

509
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:39,322
Choose samgyupsal.

510
00:48:39,347 --> 00:48:40,673
Mango graham.

511
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:42,670
Choose lace bras and panties.

512
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:45,174
Choose the kind of life

513
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:46,659
where you don't
have to choose

514
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:48,342
whether you're allowed
to dream or not.

515
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,453
Choose to be happy.

516
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:52,561
Choose your family.

517
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:54,673
Choose yourself.

518
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:57,086
But don't choose me.

519
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:12,101
Come here, girl, hurry.

520
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:16,022
Here. You wanted
a student, right?

521
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
Here.

522
00:49:17,865 --> 00:49:19,850
Very fresh.

523
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:21,627
I know you'll enjoy it,

524
00:49:21,652 --> 00:49:23,227
that's why you
should order more.

525
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:25,279
Enjoy tonight.

526
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:31,795
You're pretty.

527
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:34,081
What's your name?

528
00:54:47,086 --> 00:54:48,300
I'm off.

529
00:55:13,504 --> 00:55:14,546
How are you?

530
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:16,051
It's okay.

531
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,773
[cheering, applauding]

532
01:03:30,997 --> 01:03:33,711
[cheering, applauding]

533
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:48,548
Come on!

534
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:51,306
- Just a kiss!
- You already had a lot.

535
01:04:51,504 --> 01:04:52,972
It's not enough!

536
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:25,625
I'm right here, okay?

537
01:05:26,616 --> 01:05:28,076
I won't leave you.

538
01:05:32,403 --> 01:05:33,738
I love you very much.

539
01:05:50,473 --> 01:05:53,183
That was the last
time I saw Dario.

540
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:55,203
I didn't look for him anymore

541
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:57,232
because what would I even say?

542
01:05:58,773 --> 01:06:00,572
That I'm quitting dancing?

543
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,039
That I love him?

544
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,313
That I'd leave everything
behind for him.

545
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:06,333
I couldn't do that.

546
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,522
So I only saw him
in my dreams.

547
01:06:09,826 --> 01:06:11,891
In my dreams,
we were together.

548
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:15,361
At our hangout spot
on top of the junk mountain.

549
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:17,732
He whispers his dreams to me.

550
01:06:18,001 --> 01:06:20,159
And I'd answer with mine.

551
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:22,134
We'd laugh together.

552
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:24,564
He'd kiss me.

553
01:06:25,222 --> 01:06:27,339
I'd smile because
I'm so happy.

554
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:30,696
Then I wake up.

555
01:06:31,222 --> 01:06:32,296
He's gone.

556
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:35,003
And here I am,
