00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,600
Jiahui, you know me.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Should I make this call or not?

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Who's this?

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Hello?

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Dessert store?

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Jin...

10
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,600
It's just a misunderstanding.

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
A misunderstanding.

12
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't worry. I've put it behind me.

13
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,100
Please, Miss.

14
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't run my business.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,800
I already told you that I'd apologize.

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,700
Why should you apologize?

17
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,300
The ones who messed up should apologize.

18
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,400
Call those guys back, the one called Niqiu and the rest.

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,300
They aren't locals.

20
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
They only came over to hang out with me.

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
I don't care.

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
I already called Hu Youyu.

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
He's already put it behind him.

24
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Why are you being so nosy?

25
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,800
Listen. We're in the same situation.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
You're protecting your buddies.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,300
I have to protect mine, too.

28
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,600
If you loiter here, I can only call the police.

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
Go ahead.

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Please, Miss!

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm begging you!

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,600
I really...

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,200
Sister!

34
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing?

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Are you... Mr. Hu Youyu?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
J-Just call me Xiao Hu.

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
You're Jin, right?

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,700
Yes! I'm Jin.

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Hu!

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Here's the thing.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I was planning to apologize to you in person soon,

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,600
but this lady insists on asking my buddies to do it.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,000
They aren't locals.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
They only came over to hang out with me.

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,500
Flight tickets aren't cheap either.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,400
It costs a few thousand for all three of them.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900
They're regular employees without much money.

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
If you're fine with a phone call apology, I'll get them to call you.

49
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
It's really no big deal. You don't have to do that.

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
I don't mind. It's just a misunderstanding.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,700
Yes, a misunderstanding.

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
Just a misunderstanding.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,500
Mr. Hu, here's the thing.

54
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,200
Shes been sitting here for days.

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,300
For days?

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, everyone knows about this.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
It's too embarrassing!

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,800
A small business like mine can't survive large tides.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Brother, I didn't know about this either. I'm really sorry.

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
No, I should be the one apologizing. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,700
- No. I'm sorry.
- Okay, fine.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Sister, I thought you went out to have fun.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm really not bothered by this matter.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
It's embarrassing to be stared at by a crowd.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
It's fine.

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,300
He doesn't care anyway.

67
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Sister, how about I treat you to a meal at Galsang Flower Restaurant?

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's have lunch, okay?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Come on! Time for lunch!

70
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Let's go!

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll give you two days.

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
No, it's fine.

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't worry. We won't come back.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
Have a booming business!

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Let's go.

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
Watch your step.

77
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,600
Two days!

78
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's go!

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,500
Here you go.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay, let's go. Sit in the back.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Why are you staring at me?

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Sister, try this.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,380
This is good. It's is their specialty.

84
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,220
Have a taste.

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,900
Speak your mind.

86
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,900
Shall we talk this through?

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,400
Let's put this behind us.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,600
Actually, I feel uneasy if you insist on doing this.

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
They've already left.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
It's preposterous to call them back.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,300
As the saying goes,

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
"Forgiving others is to forgive yourself."

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,300
You must think that I'm putting my finger in your pie.

94
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,400
Nope.

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Not at all.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
I never felt that way.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,300
I promise.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just feel a little puzzled.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a little... excessive.

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,500
That's because this matter isn't a problem, to begin with. Right?

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,400
Besides, we barely got to know each other.

102
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,000
We're just friends living in the same courtyard.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,200
You're too nice to me.

104
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,400
I... I don't deserve this.

105
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Yes, that's all.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I understand.

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
But don't you want to give it a shot?

108
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,900
G-Give what a shot?

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,400
Earning some respect from others.

110
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,100
R-Respect?

111
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
Sister, listen up.

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,100
Ever since I started my music career,

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,400
I've put down all my pride.

114
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I only came this far thanks to my audacity and shamelessness.

115
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,500
If I can't accept being hustled or mocked a little,

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
I'd be suffering from depression by now.

117
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,400
Moreover, I owe all of these to my dad.

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,100
When I was in a band, my dad objected.

119
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
He refused to let me do what I wanted.

120
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,800
When I finally clinched a gig,

121
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,700
my old man took a taxi over and ruined the show.

122
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,600
He smashed my guitar and my bandmate's drums.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
He has a terrible temper.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,600
He's already in this state,

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,200
but he'd smash cups if he heard my mom on the phone with me.

126
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Xiao Yu, you've been through a lot,

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
but I think you're talented.

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Remember when you sang "Wind" at the live house in Beijing?

129
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,500
I thought it was a marvelous song when I heard it.

130
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,300
It left a deep impression in my mind instantly.

131
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,800
You're truly brilliant,

132
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,800
but not every gifted person is acknowledged in this world.

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,700
You need to make a living.

134
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
You sing at the bar,

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,000
but these aren't reasons to be trampled over by others.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,300
Got it?

137
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
Come on, Uncle.

138
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,800
Of course.

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,100
All right.

140
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,000
The dishes are ready.

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
Here. Put it in front of Uncle Deqing.

142
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, you must have been waiting for a long time.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,600
- Okay.
- I can reach it.

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,700
A'Yao, I saw you showing the bookstore owner around our village.

146
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
How are things going?

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
The deal hasn't been sealed yet.

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
When is Honghong returning?

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
She just left.

150
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Tickets are expensive.

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Why would she come back so often?

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Enjoy your food.

153
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
Call me if you need anything.

154
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay, you can get on with your work.

155
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
You have to understand this.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Grandpa is old and has a bad temper.

157
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,500
It's good if someone wants to rent the old house.

158
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,700
I have no objections.

159
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,300
It's a contribution to our village's income anyway.

160
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
You're absolutely right.

161
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,500
A'Yao, I know it's hard to boost the village's tourism.

162
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm childhood friends with your dad.

163
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,300
I really want to help you,

164
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,400
but I don't know how I can help.

165
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,300
You devoted so much to this bookstore.

166
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,800
It'll be great for you if the bookstore opens here.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
Uncle, you're right,

168
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,100
but the house belongs to Grandpa Yang.

169
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,500
I need his approval.

170
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Persuade him if you have a chance.

171
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's seal the deal with the bookstore first.

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Leave the rest to me.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,900
Uncle, get his approval first.

174
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
The house belongs to him.

175
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
We have to respect his decision.

176
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't worry. I'll make it work.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Come on.

178
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
This is a good deal for both of us.

179
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
We're allies.

180
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,300
I believe in you.

181
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,800
Xiao Huang needs results for her career,

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
and we want profits.

183
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Uncle, just voice your requests honestly.

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,200
I'll try to get them fulfilled for you.

185
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Since we're the only ones here, I'll be frank.

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm not asking for much rent.

187
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,800
The rate can be similar to the house of Xiao Gang's aunt.

188
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Xiao Gang's aunt?

189
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Where is it?

190
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,230
Here, have some tea.

191
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,439
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

192
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,650
This tea is good.

193
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,039
It's Mr. Ma's tea.

194
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,690
Mr. Ma said that drinking gongfu tea is also a good way to cultivate your mind.

195
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,469
So, Uncle Deqing can persuade Grandpa Yang to rent out the house,

196
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:01,159
but he's asking for quite a pricey rent.

197
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,320
It's more than that. It's exorbitant.

198
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
If he only wanted to raise it slightly, we can negotiate for him.

199
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,832
But he wants the rent of a tourist hot spot.

200
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,549
He even said that money definitely isn't a problem for the boss.

201
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,059
That's not the problem!

202
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,550
We can't negotiate with such greedy demands.

203
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,470
I think you shouldn't tell the bookstore team first.

204
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,560
If it were me, I'd think that the people here were rude.

205
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,870
They're trying to make a buck off me immediately.

206
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,620
That's my worry as well.

207
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,420
We can only settle this by ourselves.

208
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,860
Can we ask for a plot of land from the village committee?

209
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
The land here is limited.

210
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,109
Agricultural land can't be used either.

211
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:44,589
Besides, the boss prefers that old estate.

212
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,910
What a headache.

213
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,039
Don't worry. I'll discuss this with him tomorrow.

214
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,379
We can negotiate the payment method.

215
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,509
A payment of five-years each time.

216
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,690
We'll let Xiao Huang discuss progressive increases.

217
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,610
However, without existing profits, it's unreasonable to ask for pricey rent.

218
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,450
A'Yao, you can't speak for capitalists.

219
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,230
You have to side with me. We're in the same boat.

220
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,460
Yes, Uncle Deqing.

221
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,600
But the rent...

222
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,850
If you don't want to offend them, I can talk to them.

223
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,530
I can be audacious.

224
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,660
It's not like that.

225
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,630
This meat is good. Get me another serving.

226
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Shall we get Engineer Zhang to view a different spot?

227
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,509
Didn't they find it problematic that the shuttle bus couldn't get in?

228
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,160
I convinced them that the place has a nice and quiet ambiance.

229
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,830
Walking and cycling would also be a draw for tourists.

230
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,240
Yes.

231
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,869
I've said everything I could.

232
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,000
I have no other solutions in mind.

233
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,850
Let me talk to him tomorrow.

234
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,749
I'm in charge of this matter.

235
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:13,090
I'll try my best to raise the rent reasonably.

236
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,559
This is very reasonable.

237
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,440
It's my house, so I should be able to decide on the rent.

238
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,590
Why is this unreasonable?

239
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,800
Yes, you're right.

240
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,409
Xiao Huang, I think you're a good village officer.

241
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,990
You've done so much for the people.

242
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,050
You're on the same side as us.

243
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,159
I also think you're capable of anything you set your eyes on.

244
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,799
That's because you're a university graduate.

245
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,790
You're cultured, capable, educated, kind, and upright.

246
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,559
Our humble village is honored by your presence.

247
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,260
It's like the skies have been painted in gold, shimmering bright.

248
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,049
- I'll wait for your good news.
- Okay.

249
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,470
Are these for my dad?

250
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,190
Yes. They are. I almost forgot about them.

251
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,039
How thoughtful.

252
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,729
Thank you. I'll wait for your good news.

253
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,280
Okay.

254
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,260
What are you doing?

255
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,630
I'm stripping away all the flattery Uncle Deqing stacked on me.

256
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,690
Listen up.

257
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,750
Uncle Deqing is like a piece of hob meat.

258
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,920
What? What's hob meat?

259
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,470
You see, hob meat is hard to cut, hard to cook, and hard to chew.

260
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,900
Such meat is full of tendons, and the skin is thick.

261
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,709
All he has are persistent unreasonable demands and no ears.

262
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,730
You're at a loss when facing him.

263
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,059
Hob meat!

264
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,040
That's just like him!

265
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,109
There was another incident with the town's development.

266
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,470
After the contract was signed and the rent was confirmed,

267
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,429
the landlord raised a ruckus with some men for a higher rent.

268
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,999
They refused to move unless they got paid more.

269
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,949
Once they succeeded, others tried to mimick their ways.

270
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:06,329
We can't let this happen here.

271
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,189
I'll speak with the secretary if necessary.

272
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,150
I'll ask him whether the village committee can allocate some land to us.

273
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,780
That asshole Deqing keeps demanding money!

274
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,590
The boss refuses to rent his house, so you're asking the committee to allocate land?

275
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,149
That's not...

276
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,590
Yes!

277
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,700
That's right!

278
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,329
But this news hasn't gone public yet.

279
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,799
You have to keep this a secret.

280
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,910
Uncle Deqing thought the boss wanted to rent his house,

281
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,149
but the village committee has agreed to allocate some land.

282
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,479
It's a special approval.

283
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,480
That's the most convenient way.

284
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,190
- Yes.
- I know.

285
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,430
I won't blabber.

286
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,559
You have to keep this a secret.

287
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,109
Uncle Deqing would be so upset about this change.

288
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,110
I get it.

289
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm just here to deliver snacks and desserts to Jiahui.

290
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,080
You can't tell anyone, Aunty A'Gui!

291
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,860
I won't!

292

We'll take a five-minute break and be right back. Thank you.

299
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll go out for a smoke.

300
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,669
Isn't that lady here today?

301
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,770
She can't be here every day.

302
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,390
Thanks, buddy.

303
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,619
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Hu!

304
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,900
- You guys again? What are you doing? Leave me alone!
- Mr. Hu!

305
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,420
Get away from me!

306
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,630
- Stop!
- Calm down!

307
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,050
We aren't here to stir trouble.

308
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,319
Exactly!

309
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,840
We're here to apologize.

310
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

311
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,590
We messed up back then.

312
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,450
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

313
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,750
Come on.

314
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,669
- One, two, three.
- <i>Sorry!</i>

315
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,230
- One, two, three.
- <i>Sorry!</i>

316
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,539
- One, two, three.
- <i>Sorry!</i>

317
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,260
Mr. Hu, how about beating me to vent your anger?

318
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,749
- Hit me! Beat me!
- Punch me.

319
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,519
What are you guys doing? Let go!

320
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,240
- Beat me!
- Mr. Hu, please!

321
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,380
Mr. Hu! This way, please.

322
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,300
- Don't panic.
- Take it easy.

323
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,329
Don't be nervous.

324
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:38,280
Be careful.

325
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,219
Big Brother!

326
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,190
He's here!

327
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,970
Mr. Hu! Mr. Hu! Mr. Hu!

328
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,050
You're finally here!

329
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,819
You can just call me.

330
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,989
That won't do. I have to do this in person.

331
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,440
- I was even worried that you'd refuse to come.
- Yeah, exactly.

332
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,479
We have to do this in person.

333
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,819
I'm not bothered by that matter.

334
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,360
You're so magnanimous.

335
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,770
Come on. This way, please.

336
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,950
Private room cuisine?

337
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,360
Yes.

338
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,710
Listen up.

339
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,149
I can have a meal, but don't make me drink.

340
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,910
Okay! You call the shots.

341
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,100
No drinks! Definitely not!

342
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,210
Come on, let's go. This way, please.

343
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,320
Watch your step.

344
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,750
Take good care of the guitar.

345
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,430
- This way?
- Yes.

346
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,010
Be careful.

347
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,890
We finally managed to treat Mr. Hu to a good meal.

348
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,200
He's so pleased from the drinks. I have to use the toilet.

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,239
Brother, don't pee here!

350
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,669
The toilet is over there. Let's go.

351
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,090
- I'll take you there.
- Me too.

352
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,240
Mr. Hu,

353
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,839
you're my big brother from now on.

354
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,200
What's the saying... "No discord, no concord."

355
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,640
You're right about that.

356
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,559
We have to help and trust each other.

357
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,050
Yes.

358
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,100
Mr. Hu!

359
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,120
Sir! Sir!

360
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,109
Wait a minute! You forgot your belongings.

361
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,280
We left stuff behind?

362
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,500
Here you go.

363
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,920
These are yours.

364
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,460
Mine? Aren't you carrying my stuff?

365
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,200
I bought these for you.

366
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,290
Why did you buy all these things?

367
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,629
There's no need for such pleasantries next time.

368
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,630
Take them. Come on, Mr. Hu.

369
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,080
I'll carry them for you.

370
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,289
Sure. Let's go.

371
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,040
Thank you.

372
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,380
This way, Mr. Hu. Be careful.

373
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,660
I'll bring it to the car.

374
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,180
That's so nice of you.

375
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,950
I should do this. Are you okay?

376
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,660
I'm fine.

377
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,720
Sister!

378
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,220
Sister! Open the door.

379
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,310
You're really drunk.

380
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,150
Thank you.

381
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,770
What are you doing?

382
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,380
You can have these.

383
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,750
I don't need these. Take them away.

384
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,530
Well, what do you want?

385
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,799
We can chat tomorrow.

386
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,580
Go to bed early.

387
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,310
Sister,

388
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,040
why are you so nice to me?

389
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,440
I've been a good-for-nothing all these years.

390
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,320
No one likes my songs.

391
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,860
I... have no money.

392
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,350
I like flirting with girls.

393
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm a perv through and through.

394
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,940
I'm so corny.

395
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,790
I'm not even filial.

396
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,330
There, there.

397
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,090
I'm a piece of trash.

398
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,940
A huge pile of trash.

399
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,690
Why are you still so nice to me?

400
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't even know how to express my gratitude.

401
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,810
Do you want to thank me?

402
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,390
Will you do anything?

403
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:22,010
Just tell me. I'll do anything you wish. I can do anything.

404
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,350
Promise me never to debase yourself again.

405
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,520
I think you're great.

406
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,090
Okay, I don't need anything.

407
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,050
Go to bed.

408
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,720
Do you want to come in?

409
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,519
The homestay's soundproofing has to be perfect.

410
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,289
We can't save on this aspect.

411
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,949
Is this an issue of soundproofing?

412
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:30,370
Isn't this an issue of their moral conduct?

413
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,860
You don't have to lower your voice. They can't hear you.

414
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,630
Will this last for the whole night?

415
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,230
From my experience, such things don't last.

416
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,570
Your experience?

417
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,660
My experience working in a hotel.

418
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,530
<i>[Youfeng Courtyard]</i>

419
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,820
Why are you so quiet?

420
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,260
Didn't sleep well?

421
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,940
Why are you making stuffed buns so early in the morning?

422
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,149
Weren't you craving your mom's long beans and pork buns yesterday?

423
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:57,450
I'll let you try mine.

424
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,419
- What's wrong?
- My ear is itchy. Scratch it for me.

425
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,180
Scratch it, please.

426
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,790
Scratch it.

427
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,940
Farther up.

428
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,390
Okay, I feel fine. I'm fine now.

429
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,380
I'll help you with the buns.

430
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,599
Nah, it's fine. I'm down to the last two.

431
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,999
Let me share some gossip.

432
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,620
Go ahead.

433
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,620
We're the only ones in the kitchen.

434
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,010
Why are you...

435
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,939
You're becoming like the village's aunties.

436
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,890
- So gossipy.
- Say that again.

437
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,420
- What did you say?
- No, stop.

438
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,150
I'm making stuffed buns. Stop.

439
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,049
Are the buns in the steamer ready?

440
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,939
I... I almost forgot.

441
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,640
Let me check.

442
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,700
They're ready. We can eat them.

443
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,190
- Come on. Let me do it.
- Stay back. It's hot.

444
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,569
Don't touch it. Stop.

445
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:11,969
Stay away.

446
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,170
Walk out. Chat with Granny.

447
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,040
I'll tell you when they're ready. Be careful.

448
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,379
What's with the bookstore?

449
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:35,390
Why did I hear that the village committee will be allocating land?

450
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,920
Who said that?

451
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,090
Word is going around the village.

452
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,060
Someone even asked me about it.

453
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,070
I told them I didn't know.

454
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,589
If someone asks you again, say that it's true.

455
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,970
You're just unsure about the specifics.

456
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,750
Deqing's father has a terrible temper.

457
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,330
He's not as amicable as your grandpa.

458
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,109
But they're pretty good friends.

459
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:01,560
They got along well when they were younger.

460
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,479
Your dad used to go to his place often.

461
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:08,280
During celebrations, he'd even offer gifts.

462
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,230
Grandpa Yang was nice to me when I was young.

463
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,680
Don't people enjoy the hustle and bustle when they get older?

464
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,799
My grandma enjoyed that a lot.

465
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,589
Some people aren't like that.

466
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:24,250
My mom would be sleepy and want to go to bed when there was a crowd.

467
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,139
Yeah. When I went to my great-granny's home as a child, she would always take a nap after lunch.

468
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:32,770
You were too naughty.

469
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,249
Is it delicious?

470
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,820
Does it taste like your mom's cooking?

471
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,100
It's really good.

472
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,689
Be careful.

473
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,940
I'm fine.

474
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,530
There are steps behind you. Watch your step.

475
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,840
Okay.

476
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,780
Take it slow.

477
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,450
This way.

478
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,850
Okay, here. This will do.

479
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,589
I'll handle the rest. You can get back to work.

480
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:08,740
Okay.

481
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,450
Sister Yingzi, want to have coffee? I'll treat you.

482
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,920
Are you earning money?

483
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,479
I'm doing okay lately.

484
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,999
I want a mocha with extra chocolate.

485
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,460
Okay.

486
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,220
Sister Na Na,

487
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,349
Sister Yingzi wants a mocha with extra chocolate.

488
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,740
I want a latte. Thank you.

489
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,520
Hello, everyone.

490
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,710
I'll continue carving this basin today.

491
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,630
I got this from a granny living in the village.

492
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,000
It was used to feed chickens.

493
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,350
The wood is great.

494
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,390
I'll carve a lotus on it.

495

<i>You guys must be curious about our current location.</i>

497
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:12,999
<i>In fact, this is a travel vlog.</i>

498
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,839
<i>You used to travel with our recommendations</i>

<i>and follow in our steps.</i>

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,769
<i>[DIfferent]
Today is a little different.</i>

501
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,869
<i>Let's try following in the steps of another video instead.</i>

502
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:26,249
<i>You guys can search on the internet for this.</i>

503
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,850
<i>There's a tourism promotional video called, "Meet Yourself."</i>

504
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,669
<i>After watching that video,
[Meet Yourself]</i>

505
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:35,039
<i>I did some research and realized that few people have been here.</i>

506
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,420
<i>This tofu smells amazing!</i>

507
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,319
<i>What's in the coated tofu?
[Fragrant]</i>

508
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,020
<i>It's just tofu.</i>

509
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,310
<i>Just tofu?
Yes.
[Just tofu]</i>

510
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,499
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

511
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:44,720
<i>[Achieved, Coated Tofus]
All tofu.</i>

512
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,220
<i>Coated tofu!</i>

513
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,150
- Granny Caiyun!
- Yeah.

514
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,070
<i>Granny, I think your clothes are gorgeous.</i>

515
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,860
<i>Your headwear is pretty, too.</i>

516
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,190
<i>[Cute]
This isn't the prettiest one.</i>

517
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,640
<i>I think this is beautiful enough.</i>

518
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,890
<i>Look over there.</i>

519
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,300
<i>The girl at the beverage counter has a similar hairstyle to mine.</i>

520
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,570
<i>She's gorgeous, too.</i>

521
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,590
<i>A natural beauty. She can totally be a celebrity.</i>

522
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,719
<i>For some reason, I feel like I'm chasing after an idol!</i>

523
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,139
Is this person that famous online?

524
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,930
Of course. She has over five million followers! She's impressive!

525
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,719
She even praised Sister Na Na's looks.

526
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,690
Maybe Sister Na Na will go viral online.

527
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,190
Xiao Xin, be careful.

528
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,940
Manager Chun, that wasn't me.

529
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,550
Let's keep watching.

530
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,490
I didn't think she had that many viewers!

531
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,540
<i>Can I ask about the pattern that lady is working on?</i>

532
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,489
<i>That one. A butterfly.</i>

533
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,700
<i>It's so cute!</i>

534
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,530
<i> I'll tie-dye a shirt to a skirt today.</i>

535
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,320
A'Yao! Can you call some guys over from the warehouse to help with packing and deliveries?

536
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,030
We're really busy. The boxes are running out, too.

537
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,189
What about the goods?

538
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,520
Some patterns are out of stock, but the rest are fine.

539
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,669
Okay, I'll call people over.

540
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:08,440
- Okay, I'll get on with my work.
- Okay!

541
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,760
Hello?

542
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,390
Okay, I got it. Please try to work overtime.

543
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,840
Thank you.

544
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,220
Brother Sen, change the tamarinds as preorders to be dispatched within a week.

545
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,210
Aunty Feng, Chuchu, the tamarinds will become preorders to be dispatched within a week.

546
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,840
Please explain this to the customers. Don't make mistakes.

547
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Okay.

548
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,900
Why are orders flooding in so suddenly? We can't keep up.

549
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,479
Xiaoyue, call Daxia!

550
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,269
We're running out of lotus seeds. Ask him if they have any.

551
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:49,960
Okay.

552
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,799
We're short on manpower.

553
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,080
The sudden increase in orders is keeping everyone busy.

554
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,020
One of you has to come over.

555
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,420
What?

556
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,990
Call Xiaochun?

557
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,040
Okay. I got it.

558
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,049
Is there another livestream?

559
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,780
It was a mess last time.

560
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,200
We packed and delivered all night for days.

561
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,470
After that, we received loads of returns.

562
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,660
So annoying!

563
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,389
Customers are just making impulse buys.

564
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,579
We're slaving away because of their impulses.

565
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,450
Xiaochun, come here now.

566
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,690
Stop! That's too much!

567
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,160
Okay.

568
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,160
<i>We're at the horse ranch now.</i>

569
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,909
<i>Look! The scenery is gorgeous.</i>

570
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,450
<i>Handsome, can we ride outside? Along the sea.</i>

571
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,729
<i>No, you can't. You can only ride on the ranch.</i>

572
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,419
<i>What about the horse that the couple in the video rode by the seaside? Is that here?</i>

573
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,719
<i>That horse belongs to my boss.</i>

574
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,429
<i>That guy in the video is our boss.</i>

575
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,349
<i>Is the lady with him his wife?</i>

576
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:54,029
<i>Nope, she's a volunteer who was here for a vacation.</i>

577
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,540
<i>She's back to run a homestay.</i>

578
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,120
After making the promotional video,

579
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,200
Chairman Xie and I invited many travel vloggers to come here.

580
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,690
They might be able to promote it for us if they enjoyed the video.

581
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,350
Look! Our hard work paid off.

582
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,239
Even though this is the result,

583
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,590
the process isn't what you think it will be.

584
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,720
<i>I dyed this myself!</i>

585
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,070
<i>This is the one you saw before. Pretty, right?</i>

586
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,509
<i>I'll continue sharing stories as I open these parcels.</i>

587
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:29,990
<i>Here's an official declaration.</i>

588
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,000
<i>I swear on my love in my next life</i>

589
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,279
<i>[Not Sponsored]
that I didn't accept any money for this promotion.</i>

590
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:42,069
<i>[Self-paid]
I paid for the travel vlog myself.</i>

591
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,255
<i>[Fast Forward x2.0]
My fans know that I've done many travel vlogs</i>

592
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,419
<i>and videos about interesting shops.</i>

593
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,119
<i>We've been to so many places in China,</i>

594
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,150
<i>but many places we visit can be found with a quick internet search.</i>

595
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,300
<i>So, I've been wondering about uncovering new travel spots.</i>

596
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,009
<i>I can bring you guys to explore and evaluate new places.</i>

597
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,859
<i>As for this time,</i>

598
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,300
<i>[Fan Comment]
a fan left a comment that this promotional video was amazing.</i>

599
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,240
<i>They suggested that I visit.</i>

600
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,239
<i>I thought it was pretty nice, so I decided to visit.</i>

601
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,089
<i>[Wonderful]
To be honest, I really felt that this trip was wonderful.</i>

602
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,490
<i>Even though the infrastructure there isn't well-developed,</i>

603
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,939
<i>[Simple, Cozy]
the place was simple and cozy.</i>

604
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,819
<i>So, I'm not lying. I only have one sentence for this.</i>

605
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:20,650
<i>If you want to enjoy the breeze and relax,</i>

606
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,440
<i>[Xie Zhiyap]
I really recommend this place.</i>

607
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,870
Hello, Chairman Xie?

608
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,860
Xinxin and I are watching Trekking Luo Li's video.

609
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,150
I can ask her.

610
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,119
Are you free?

611
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,910
The tie-dye workshop is short on manpower for packing.

612
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Okay, we're heading over.

613
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,900
Let's go.

614
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,799
Where will the bookstore be?

615
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,799
The village committee is allocating land for it.

616
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,949
Didn't they choose Grandpa Yang's old house?

617
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,730
Grandpa Yang thought that it would be noisy, so he refused.

618
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,429
It's good that the village committee is allocating land.

619
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,350
Everyone gets a share of the money annually.

620
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,950
That's great.

621
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,470
Come on, have some oranges.

622
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,910
Is A'Yao here?

623
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,720
He's inside.

624
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,640
A'Yao.

625
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,390
Uncle Deqing? Why are you here?

626
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,030
I'm here about that!

627
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,790
Let's speak outside.

628
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,540
That? There's no rush.

629
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,119
Look! We've got our hands full right now.

630
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,239
Even Xiao Huang came to help out on her day off.

631
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,440
Let's talk about this later.

632
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,669
- Okay. I'm not in a hurry either.
- Okay.

633
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:56,430
- I'll wait for you to contact me.
- Okay.

634
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,860
Is business that booming? You're so busy.

635
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,110
By the way, Uncle Deqing,

636
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,070
you didn't pay the fees for using the harvester.

637
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,070
Everyone else paid up.

638
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,470
You can just look for the village committee's accountant.

639
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,100
I totally forgot.

640
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,099
- I'll go over right now.
- Okay.

641
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,569
Get on with your work.

642
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,190
I won't bother you.

643
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,509
What allocated land?

644
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,110
I don't know.

645
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,070
A'Yao never talks to me about such things.

646
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,260
I don't ask either.

647
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,050
Everyone in the village is saying this.

648
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,839
Then, it should be true.

649
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,690
There are no waves without wind.

650
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,509
You don't want to rent out the place anyway. This is good.

651
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,900
Who said I refused to rent it out?

652
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,990
A'Yao and Xiao Huang asked you time and again.

653
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,339
If you were willing, why would Xiao Huang ask the village committee for land?

654
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:18,840
Xiao Huang asked for land?

655
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,989
Oh no, I spilled the beans!

656
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:25,800
Don't tell anyone, or A'Yao will scold me again!

657
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,460
Got it? I'm leaving, Aunty.

658
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,040
Aunty Yang, I'll take an orange.

659
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,950
Don't tell anyone!

660
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,939
I won't.

661
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,319
Your basket.

662
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:37,820
Okay.

663
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,570
Is that all?

664
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,820
Yes.

665
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,550
Thank you. We made you come over this late.

666
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,470
Don't worry. More orders are good.

667
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,029
What time should I come over tomorrow?

668
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,429
Before 4:00 p.m.

669
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:56,849
Okay. We'll get going.

670
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,640
- Be careful.
- Okay.

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,120
Tomato and egg noodles.

680
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,499
Like the type made by my grandma. Fry the tomatoes and stew them into soup.

681
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,100
I can't make your grandma's version.

682

Xiao Hu Lu is in bed,

We're done.

692
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,700
The goods have been sent out.

693
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,000
We...

694
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:50,319
We were just fooling around.

695
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,670
Yes, fooling around.

696
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,160
Brother,

697
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,680
what's your relationship with Hongdou?

698
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,520
What do you mean? I said we were fooling around.

699
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,570
What?

700
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,770
We're dating. Aren't we?

701
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,670
Yes.

702
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,200
We are.

703
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,210
Brother, shame on you.

704
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,099
What's so embarrassing about this?

705
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,160
Ask anyone out there.

706
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,010
Everyone knows you've been dying to date Hongdou for ages.

707
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,760
- Cut the nonsense.
- Nonsense?

708
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,970
You're the one announcing to the world that the new homestay owner is your girlfriend.

709
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm just worried that Hongdou will feel embarrassed.

710
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,550
What's so embarrassing about wanting a partner?

711
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,799
Everyone wants a partner, right?

712
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,840
Exactly.

713
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,309
Xiaochun, what about you and A'Hui?

714
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,900
There's nothing between us.

715
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,380
I drew the line ages ago.

716
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,440
Nothing will happen.

717
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,970
Isn't he pretty nice?

718
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,870
You snap at him, but he never loses his temper.

719
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,909
I don't like him.

720
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:15,100
Besides, he always talks

721
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,590
about the house his dad bought for him in the city.

722
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,470
He's so young, but he keeps bragging about his parents' money.

723
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,220
What a good-for-nothing.

724
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,489
Look. He thinks a house in the city is an advantage,

725
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:32,500
but Xie Xiaochun treats money like dirt.

726
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,230
That's not right. Listen up.

727
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,260
I love money.

728
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,689
Bingo! Me too!

729
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,769
All right. Let's get going.

730
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:45,909
Brother, I have to tell you this.

731
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:48,219
That old peacock is jittery.

732
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:52,250
He confronted Xiao Huang at the village committee today.

733
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,199
Did he succeed?

734
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,770
Of course not.

735
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,900
Who's the old peacock?

736
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,099
Uncle Deqing.

737
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:01,230
Aunty Baoping and the rest like to call him this.

738
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,795
You know what, Hongdou?

739
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:08,920
We've heard him boasting since we were young.

740
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,599
He always talks about how brilliant his great-grandfather was running a business as a young man.

741
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,550
All that talk about the fortunes their family made,

742
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,719
the expensive food they ate, and the lavish clothes they wore.

743
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,619
He was like a peacock with its feathers on display.

744
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,500
Boasting whenever he could.

745
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,549
I can understand that.

746
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:26,159
I used to have a colleague named Jin in the hotel.

747
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,759
His great-grandfather's first name was Aisin Gioro.

748
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:31,159
If we were still in the Qing Dynasty,

749
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,410
he would be a princess.

750
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,270
Appalling.

751
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,520
It's been a long day. Let's go back and rest.

752
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,719
Brother, I'm worried about returned goods.

753
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,009
That's out of our control.

754
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,639
We have to deliver existing orders.

755
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,189
- Wait a minute. Xiaochun, turn off the lights.
- Okay.

756
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,680
Turn off the lights.

757
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,600
Okay.

758
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,130
- Let's go home.
- Come on.
