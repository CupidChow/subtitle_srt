Know, knowing, know? I get a headache the moment you speak.

"A Lonely Man."

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,110
Little Sister Damai, want to listen to it?

8
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,850
I'd love to.

9
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,490
Okay, I'll sing it for you.

10
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,370
Mr. Hu, let's sing "Be Fine" together.

11
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,090
- "Be Fine"!
- "Be Fine"?

Okay.

Cutie Pie, this cucumber is very yummy.

Cutie Pie, this spicy bar is amazing.

There's chocolate, too.

I really pity Cutie Pie. There are so many yummy things around.

Uncle A'Yao only feeds it grass.

He's horrible.

60
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,170
Why am I horrible?

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,210
What are you feeding Cutie Pie?

62
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,730
- Run!
- Help!

63
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,520
- Got one.
- Leave me!

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,670
I won't die! Run! Hurry up!

65
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,070
Run! Run!!!

66
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,370
Apples are okay. Cucumbers are also okay.

67
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,430
However, you can't feed it spicy bars or chocolate.

68
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,340
Cutie Pie will get a stomach ache if it eats these, got it?

69
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,620
I fed it roasted eggplants, and it ate that.

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,370
When was that?

71
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,560
Uncle A'Yao's rice noodles are so yummy, right?

72
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,590
It's tasy!

73
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,440
Super yummy!

74
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,250
Yeah!

75
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,050
So tasty.

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,180
It isn't crowded today.

79
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,470
Why did you ask me to be a volunteer here?

80
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm a guest.

81
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,910
Hongdou, you'll be bored if you don't do anything.

82
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,590
How about volunteering for me? I'll cover your meals.

83
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm not bored. I'm here to rest.

84
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,660
I'm reading now.

85
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,840
I saw that. You read briefly and then started using your phone.

86
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,990
You read the headline news and got into a bad mood, right?

87
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,210
Are you really planning to wander around for three full months?

88
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm not wandering around.

89
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,590
I'm either sitting or lying down.

90
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,660
Who was the one who said exercise promises longevity?

91
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,600
Exercise promises longevity, but not work.

92
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,010
Volunteering is also a form of rest.

93
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,610
That's different.

94
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,180
Volunteering is free labor.

95
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,580
Labor and rest are two separate things.

96
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,430
Don't trick me with capitalist wordplay.

97
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,830
Can't Xiaochun find another worker?

98
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,710
We have enough workers in the cafe. There's me, Granny Xiuying, and Granny Caiyun.

99
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,600
Xiaochun drops by to help out when she's done with her work.

100
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,330
The grannies are mascots.

101
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,530
They're the faces of our cafe.

102
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,860
A volunteer just needs to help out when it's busy.

103
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,910
You'll have your free time.

104
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,040
Why are you coaxing me to be a volunteer?

105
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,240
It's just... a casual question.

106
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,750
- What's wrong?
- Hongdou.

107
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,740
Did that customer leave?

108
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,730
Yeah, quite some time ago.

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,380
Another forgotten bill. It happens once or twice a month.

110
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,860
Let me take a look.

111
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,860
I'll chase after them.

112
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,730
- Where are you going?
- The town entrance.

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,200
That's Sister Hongdou.

114
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,170
- She's running so fast.
- What's she doing?

115
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,600
I don't know. Go after her.

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,090

Sister Hongdou, how can you run so fast?

133
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,570
I've never seen you run so fast before.

134

Sister Hongdou.

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,750
Come on, there's enough for everyone. Don't worry.

138
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,600
Uncle, I want a cream one.

139
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,140
Cream? Okay. Who hasn't taken one?

140
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,680
Everyone gets one.

141
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,090
- Who else? Here you go.
- Thanks, Uncle.

142
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,480
- Thank you, Uncle A'Yao.
- One per person.

143
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,030
Everyone got one, right? Go back home now.

144
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,040
- Stay safe.
- Goodbye, Granny.
- Bye.

145
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,850
Be careful when crossing the road. Okay?

146
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,880
Goodbye, Granny.

147
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,090
Goodbye.

148
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,680
- Goodbye, Granny.
- Goodbye.

149
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,380
- Goodbye, Granny.
- Okay, don't rush.

150
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,570
Granny, have some jujube juice.

151
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,630
- For you, too.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
You're pretty impressive.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
This place is filled with streets and alleys, but you've nailed them.

154
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
They had tons of bags with them,

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
so I guessed they'd flag for a taxi at the town entrance.

156
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,600
It's the experience of a 10-year veteran in the service industry.

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,300
The worst that could happen in the cafe is customers forgetting to pay the bill.

158
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,600
The hotel industry has far more complex problems.

159
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
Granny, let me do it.

160
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
Leave this to me.

161
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Do you still feel warm?

162
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
Is this delicious?

163
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,600
I'll give you another one if it isn't nice.

164
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
How about watermelon juice? Lemon juice?

165
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,900
Apple juice?

166
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
It's fine.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,200
How about we have a barbecue party tomorrow night?

168
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
You've been here for days, but we haven't had a party.

169
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,900
How's that?

170
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,900
We can't make a commotion after 8:30 p.m., right?

171
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,700
Won't we be a nuisance to the neighbors?

172
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,900
It's fine. I won't be annoyed.

173
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,300
Youngsters having a party isn't a nuisance.

174
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,500
It's settled then.

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Sure.

176
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,400
- Aunty!
- A'Yao.

177
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,700
- Uncle, are you done for the day?
- Yes.

178
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
Okay.

179
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,800
- Please take care of my granny.
- Sure.

180
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
We're heading to the horse ranch for a meeting.

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, bye-bye.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
- Go on.
- Bye-bye.

183
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
- Let's go.
- Bye, Aunty.

184
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Come on.

185
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Granny.

186
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,200
Did A'Yao fall in love with me?

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm just kidding.

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,500
It's a joke.

189
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Just a joke.

190
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,600
Why isn't Xia Xia home yet?

191
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
He should be here soon.

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
He got off the plane too late last night, so he went to A'Yuan's place.

193
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,400
They'll come back together this morning.

194
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,700
A'Yuan is such a handful...

195
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,400
- Eat your eggs.
- Okay.

196
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,500
Is he back?

197
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,900
- You're back!
- Mom.

198
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,200
Uncle, what yummy food did you bring back for me?

199
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,700
Only food is on your mind.

200
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
You bought so many things.

201
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
Sister.

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,100
Put your stuff down and eat first.

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
Uncle, what's this?

204
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,100
Palmier. You can have it as a snack.

205
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,300
You have to finish your meal first. Snacks come after your meal.

206
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,600
Just let her eat it if she wants to.

207
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,700
Hu Lu, get your uncle's utensils.

208
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,600
Xia Xia, I thought you said you were applying for a job in a studio in Shanghai?

209
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
- Did you go there?
- I did.

210
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
They said I'm not suited for the job.

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
I have to improve my skills.

212
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,200
Weren't they particular about your educational background?

213
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
Nope.

214
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,800
I'll work even harder under Master's guidance.

215
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
That's right. You're a rookie.

216
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,100
Be diligent in your learning.

217
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,200
You're pretty optimistic. With his temper, who knows if he'll take you back?

218
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Why not?

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll beg him until he agrees.

220
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh my god. It's way too crispy.

221
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,100
Xie Xiaoxia.

222
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,200
She learned all these from those short clips you showed her.

223
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
What the heck is that?

224
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,900
I didn't let her watch anything. Don't blame me for it.

225
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,600
Here, have some meat sauce.

226
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Is Uncle's souvenir tasty?

227
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
- Take this yourself.
- Okay.

228
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,000
You sure treat your son well.

229
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Granny, leave it. I'll do it.

230
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
I can cook.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,200
A'Yuan likes my cooking.

232
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Add two more.

233
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
He's the only one who wants steamed eggs. Both of us eat fried eggs.

234
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,700
Why are you making two different types of eggs?

235
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,500
All you do is spoil him.

236
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
He doesn't like egg yolks.

237
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
He's trying to build up his body.

238
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,600
He wants to build up his body?

239
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,500
If he grows any taller, he'll be shooting through our roof.

240
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,800
You're biased.

241
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
You're so old, but look at his age.

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,000
When I was his age, you didn't spoil me in the slightest.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,400
You chased me around the village and beat me.

244
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Every time I tried to spank you, you would flee.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
You probably didn't get hit much.

246
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,100
Anyway, you're playing favorites to your grandson.

247
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,400
Enough. Give me the dark soy sauce.

248
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
When you need to add the salt, let me do it.

249
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,600
You always add too much.

250
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,900
I don't mind, but your dear grandson is building up his body.

251
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,200
He can't eat too much salt.

252
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Stop it.

253
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,200
<i>Granny! Granny!</i>

254
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
Darling, give me a hug!

255
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,400
- I'm back, Granny!
- I miss you so much, Granny.

256
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
You're back.

257
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Let me take a look at you.

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
- Did you cut your hair?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,900
You look so sprightly.

260
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,200
Of course, Granny.

261
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,700
I'm even more dashing now.

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
Granny, what's that? It smells amazing.

263
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,500
You'll love it. They're all your favorites.

264
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,700
Wash your hands first.

265
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,000
Got it, I'll wash my hands.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You say the same thing every time.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Granny, hurry up. I'm hungry.

268
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,400
The first thing he wants when he's back is food.

269
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,100
I bought this for you, Granny.

270
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,000
The shop assistant said this is perfect for seniors at your age.

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
It's Tencel. Have a feel of it.

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,900
It's silky smooth. It's super comfortable to wear.

273
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
- How much was it?
- ¥160.

274
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
That's too expensive.

275
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Granny, try it on. Put it on. It's excellent quality, Granny.

276
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,700
- Okay.
- Try it on, Granny.

277
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Put it on later. Let's eat first.

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Sure.

279
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,600
I'll try it on after the meal.

280
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Put it here, Granny.

281
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
This is for you.

282
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Even I get a gift?

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
I know there's a better one, but it was too expensive.

284
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
I just got the basic one.

285
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,500
When I have the money, I'll buy you a better one.

286
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,000
Stop thinking about money.

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Get into university first.

288
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,200
What's with you? I got you a gift, but why didn't you thank me?

289
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank you. Your big brother loves it.

290
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,400
What a sensible boy.

291
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,300
Gross!

292
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's eat.

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,700
In the future, you have to listen to your brother.

294
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,000
Listen to him? No way.

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,800
I bet I'll be more successful than you.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What an ambitious boy.

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
That's ambitious?

298
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,200
It's empty bragging.

299
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,700
You can't even find a wife. You have no right to comment about me.

300
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,300
When I graduate, I'll make sure to get a wife first.

301
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Granny, look at him. He's starting to daydream.

302
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,400
Get a wife?

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,800
How can you say that to your brother?

304
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,600
Aren't you biased?

305
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Eat your food.

306
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Eat your eggs. We made them just for you.

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Got it.

308
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,100
Is it tasty?

309
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah, it's delicious.

Here we go.

317

Mr. Ma.

318
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,600
Mr. Hu, you're here.

319
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,200
You sure came at the right time.

320
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,500
We just finished cooking the meat and here you are.

321

He went to his master's place. We don't have to wait for him.

324
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,100
By the way, Xia Xia brought back souvenirs from Shanghai.

325
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,400
He can order these online.

326
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
It's a hassle to bring them back.

327
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,100
Let's eat while barbecuing. Everyone, eat up.

328
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,000
Here, these can be eaten.

329
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Have the meat here.

330
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Don't spill it everywhere.

331
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,300
It's a party. A party needs some good vibes.

332
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
<i>Great!</i>

333
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,600
- Who bought the flowers?
- Me.

334
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
You have great taste.

335
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,600
Enjoy my original composition later.

336
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
"A Lonely Man."

337
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
An original song.

338
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,500
It's the perfect tune when drinking with friends.

339
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,170
Here you go. Be careful.

340
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,200
Okay.

341
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Here you go.

342
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
- Hongdou.
- Thank you.

343
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,800
- Use the large mug.
- We have more here.

344
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
- Give it to your brother.
- He can't drink.

345
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
He needs soemthing to drink! Drink this.

346
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
Does everyone have a drink?

347
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Let's raise a toast!

348
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Hold on.

349
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,600
Before we drink, we have to propose a toast.

350
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,800
I'll start.

351
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,600
I wish everyone great health and safety, yeah?

352
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
Nice.

353
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,400
I hope our friendship lasts forever.

354
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
I wish everyone lasting happiness!

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
As you hoist your sails to voyage in the vast sea,

356
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,500
I hope you'll break through the storms and reach your goals.

357
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,600
I hope everyone will get a windfall.

358
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,800
May your wishes come true. Come on.

359
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,000
May our country prosper!

360
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,300
That's the best one today.

361
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,600
She gets one more drink as a reward.

362
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,000
May our country prosper!

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,900
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

364
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,400
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

365
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Why is this champagne so sweet?

366
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,600
- What's wrong?
- It's awful.

367
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

368
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Did you drink too much tea that champagne doesn't sit well with you?

369
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,800
♫ <i>I'll head to a windy place to meet you</i> ♫

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Master.

371
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
You're back.

372
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
I got you a gift.

373
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,000
Master.

374
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,500
What else do you need to say?

375
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm not going to work in Shanghai.

376
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,800
I still need your guidance and more practice.

377
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,280
Master, did you hear me?

378
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,020
I'm not deaf.

379
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,990
What are you doing?

380
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,660
Master, you always berate me for being lazy.

381
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,770
I'll sweep the floor. Master, lift your feet.

382
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,700
That's enough.

383
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,410
Get lost.

384
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,010
Master, please vent your anger by kicking me.

385
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,730
I'm sorry, Master.

386
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I'll listen to you in the future.

387
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,320
I won't play games or live stream.

388
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,040
Will you still keep me as a disciple?

389
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,750
You call me "Master."

390
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,660
but what did I say?

391
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,920
Stop pretending to work.

392
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,340
You'll be distracted after a few days of hard work.

393
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,080
Don't let your mind wander.

394
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,810
Yes, Master!

395
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,180
You scared me.

396
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,700
Go and do your work.

397
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,780
Leave.

398
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,140
Do you want Palmiers?

399
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,490
No.

400
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,990
Do you know what they are?

401
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,260
No clue.

402
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,610
It's a Shanghai specialty.

403
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,390
I don't want to eat it. You...

404
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,240
Go away.

405
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,010
It's delicious.

406
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,610
What are you doing?

407
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,860
- I...
- Have a bite.

408
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,450
Is it nice?

409
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,710
Not bad.

410
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,130
When I was in high school,

411
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,890
I wrote a love letter to a girl.

412
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,750
In the end, she told our teacher.

413
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,510
She said I was affecting her studies.

414
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,040
The teacher was our form teacher who taught us Chinese.

415
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,230
So, she read my letter aloud in class.

416
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,220
She criticized my poor vocabulary and grammar mistakes.

417
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,800
My love was too superficial.

418
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,140
I bet she told your parents.

419
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,090
She did, and my dad came over.

420
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,370
But my dad didn't think much about this

421
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,610
since I've always been a troublemaker.

422
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,280
He just gave me one piece of advice.

423
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,110
From now on, if you want to write a love letter,

424
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,690
you must have the confidence to win her heart

425
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,610
or you... you'll end up humiliating yourself.

426
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,990
Your dad is an experienced man.

427
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,090
Speaking of silly incidents,

428
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,770
I have a story to tell.

429
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,800
When I was in high school,

430
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,370
I worked diligently to finish mock text papers once.

431
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,020
When I took a break one day, I shot up to my feet...

432
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,350
and felt my hemorrhoid burst.

433
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,350
Oh my goodness!

434
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,310
Even today,

435
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,420
I can still remember the expression of the girl sitting beside me.

436
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,850
My god.

437
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,520
She even had a crush on me, but...

438
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,510
All your stories aren't as horrible as mine.

439
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,060
When I left the toilet in high school once,

440
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,890
my dress was stuck in my underwear.

441
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,110
Everyone saw my ass

442
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,730
as I walked from the toilet all the way to the classroom.

443
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,220
No one said a word to you?

444
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,100
They were busy staring.

445
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,140
I was overjoyed because I thought they were charmed by my beauty.

446
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,170
Didn't you transfer schools?

447
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,930
Nope.

448
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,270
Didn't they laugh at you?

449
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,410
They did.

450
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,510
Tons of students come to our class to stare at me.

451
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,240
I pretended I didn't give a damn,

452
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,190
like nothing ever happened.

453
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,010
What else could I do?

454
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,550
Well, what happened after that?

455
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,480
I don't really remember.

456
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,450
I forgot about it as time passed.

457
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,950
To be honest, this is just the spotlight effect.

458
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,790
You always think you're in the spotlight,

459
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,640
but no one really notices you.

460
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,250
No matter how silly an incident is, it'll be forgotten in a few days.

461
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,160
Tons of things happen in a day.

462
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,150
It's impossible to remember everything.

463
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,700
Yeah, that's right.

464
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,190
When you're my age,

465
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,320
you'll understand that suffering this level of humiliation

466
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,120
is a blessing in life.

467
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,680
You know, I fell in love with music when I was at university.

468
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,400
So, I joined a band.

469
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,820
After graduation, I didn't look for a job but practiced with the band.

470
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,250
In the end, my dad was so angry that he had a stroke.

471
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,440
Now, he can't walk well with just one leg.

472
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm plagued with regret.

473
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,270
I'm too ashamed to go home.

474
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,700
Yeah.

475
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,490
We may see many people...

476
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,390
building up success and basking in glory,

477
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,360
but we also see them fall from great heights.

478
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,690
A'Yuan,

479
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,440
do you know that your brother paid for my university education?

480
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,940
I know.

481
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,740
Aunty Baoping blabbers about it so much that all of China probably knows by now.

482
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,380
Why don't we know if everyone knows?

483
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,360
My family was poor back then.

484
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,550
We had no money for the tuition fees.

485
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,700
My mom...

486
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,120
went to borrow money from every other person around.

487
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,310
At that time, I thought I should give up on university.

488
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,090
It'd be better if I started working and earning money.

489
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,480
My mom had to feed two kids by herself.

490
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,420
Mom had to pay for our studies and keep us fed.

491
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,080
It was tough for her.

492
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,620
<i>Brother, have some tea.</i>

493
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,020
<i>Xiaochun, your mom called me</i>

494
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,380
<i>and said you want to quit school to work.</i>

495
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,860
<i>Sister Honghong said the garment factory is recruiting.</i>

496
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,390
<i>I can start with trimming threads if I work there.</i>

497
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,070
<i>Well, do you want to continue with your studies?</i>

498
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,310
<i>My wishes don't matter.</i>

499
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,170
<i>You know how poor my family is.</i>

500
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,490
<i>We depend on my mom for everything.</i>

501
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,860
<i>Regardless,</i>

502
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,190
<i>I can't... continue my studies.</i>

503
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,750
<i>Let's leave money aside.</i>

504
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,370
<i>Be frank with me.</i>

505
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,970
<i>Do you want to pursue your studies?</i>

506
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,190
<i>Aunty Baoping, I just started working and I don't have a high salary,</i>

507
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,140
<i>but I can cover Xiaochun's tuition fees.</i>

508
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,360
<i>Xiaochun is still young.</i>

509
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,450
<i>She needs to study.</i>

510
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,620
<i>Xiaochun,</i>

511
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,130
<i>studying is never a waste of time.</i>

512
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,900
<i>Knowledge is the bridge to the world.</i>

513
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,920
At that time,

514
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,050
A'Yao made a trip back from Beijing to speak to me.

515
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,140
He told me studying is never a waste of time.

516
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,900
"Knowledge is the bridge to the world."

517
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,660
I'm quoting it word for word.

518
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,130
Enough, let's talk about something else.

519
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,750
Chairman Xie is a really tough person.

520
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,110
He feels nothing if you snap at him to his face.

521
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,500
However, he'd rather be insulted than praised so bluntly.

522
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,020
I'm thinking of establishing a global fan club for Xie Zhiyao.

523
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,890
- I'll be the fan club manager.
- I'll be the deputy manager.

524
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,510
Hey, why are you getting carried away with this?

525
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
Are there membership fees?

526
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,590
None at all.

527
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,120
The idol will even eat with you.

528
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,880
Well, I'm in. You'll join, right?

529
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,250
- Join us.
- Sure.

530
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,160
Mr. Ma, this tea is amazing.

531
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,090
You have great taste.

532
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,940
The only problem is that it'll make your bladder weak.

533
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,350
- Where are you going?
- The toilet. What? You want to come along?

534
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,410
- I'm going first.
- No, let me go first.

535
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,690
Come on. Let me go first.

536
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,920
If you drink too much tea, you'll get insomnia.

537
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,380
Coffee and tea don't work for me.

538
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,780
I drank too much trying to stay up late.

539
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,100
Well, you might need to pee in the middle of the night.

540
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,390
I am the second runner-up in my hotel for holding my bladder.

541
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,220
The winner is a 22-year-old girl.

542
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,360
You compete over that?

543
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,660
It's just for fun.

544
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,800
What's the fun in this?

545
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,750
We're just seeking some joy during tough days.

546
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,710
Little A'Yuan is able to go back.

547
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,790
Who on earth leaked that secret?

548
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,700
Is this really an unsolvable mystery?

549
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,890
Do you want to know?

550
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,600
Lean closer.

551
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,800
Closer.

552
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,370
<i>You'd rather die?</i>

553
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,920
<i>You just pooped in your pants during class because of a stomach ache.</i>

554
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,550
<i>Xie Zhiyao! If you talk about it again, I'll kill myself!</i>

555
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,070
<i>Well, kill yourself after you finish high school!</i>

556
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,860
<i>Uncle A'Yuan is skipping school</i>

557
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,130
<i>- because he pooped in his pants.
- Shush.</i>

558
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,870
<i>Let's leave.</i>

559
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,120
<i>Wait! You can't go!</i>

560
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,520
<i>Xie Zhiyuan, what are you doing? Let go of her.</i>

561
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,140
<i>No, I won't!</i>

562
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,260
<i>I won't leave.</i>

563
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,910
<i>Are you okay? You aren't injured, are you?</i>

564
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,310
So, it was those naughty kids.

565
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,270
At that time, Cutie Pie often got the runs.

566
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,330
I thought it was really odd.

567
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,150
Hey, what secrets are you sharing with each other?

568
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,410
I won't tell you.

569
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,200
<i>Implement rural vitalization.</i>

570
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,000
<i>Support Party management of the village.</i>

571
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,810
- What did you buy?
- Some vegetables and fish.

572
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,640
- Come over and have dinner soon.
- Sure

573
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,780
<i>[Culture is the people's backbone and soul...]</i>
- Uncle, are you painting words?
- Yes, Xia Xia.

574
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,890
<i>Putting the peasantry first.</i>

575
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,910
<i>Support rural vitalization.</i>

576
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,730
<i>Support integrated urban-rural development.</i>

577
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,620
<i>Ensure harmony between man and nature.</i>

578
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,290
Sister Xinxin.

579
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,470
Xia Xia.

580
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,250
Uncle.

581
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,370
Are you looking for Huang Xinxin?

582
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,800
My brother asked me to help out here.

583
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,540
She was here earlier. Let me call her.

584
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,530
- Here she is.
- You came really quickly, Xia Xia.

585
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,220
Sister Xinxin. Let me help you.

586
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,440
We'll be handing these out door to door.

587
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,360
<i>[Don't Pick Up, Don't Trust Them, Don't Transfer Money
How to Identify Voice Phishing]</i>
The front lists common phishing scams.

588
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,240
The reverse side states examples of such fraud.

589
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,050
We'll hand them out door to door.

590
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,720
<i>[Common Examples of Fraud and Precautionary Measures]</i>
If the seniors can's speak Mandarin well,

591
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,270
please interpret our text.

592
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,770
Why are you handing these out so suddenly?

593
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,970
We had a campaign against loan fraud, and that was really helpful.

594
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,890
Recently, Chairman Xie suggested a campaign against voice phishing.

595
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,550
I haven't heard of any victims in our village,

596
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,370
but it's never too late to take precautions.

597
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,180
Aunty E, there have been many cases of voice phishing recently.

598
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,190
Elders your age are the main targets.

599
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,690
If you answer a phone call, saying your grandson is kidnapped

600
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,050
or your son is arrested by police for prostitution—

601
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,010
Guanjun will never commit crimes.

602
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,480
- It's just an example.
- Yes.

603
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,270
I'm just giving you an example.

604
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,050
These conmen will use all kinds of scare tactics.

605
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,740
His sole aim is to make you transfer money over.

606
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,250
- You'll be fine as long as you don't transfer any money to them.
- I got it.

607
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,650
You understand, right? Don't transfer any money. Okay?

608
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,870
Come on, Xinxin. Have some water.

609
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,570
It's fine. I have water with me.

610
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,540
- Chuchu.
- For you.

611
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,840
- Thank you.
- You should take one too.

612
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,750
Tell your family about voice phishing.

613
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,100
Okay.

614
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,820
Such tricks are so obvious.

615
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,610
- Why do people get tricked?
- Unbelievable.

616
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,730
It happens.

617
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,060
We should just remember one thing.

618
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,170
No matter who calls, keep a tight hold on your money.

619
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,540
Don't trust them no matter how sweet the deal is.

620
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,010
They must be liars.

621
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,400
Aunty Baoping is right.

622
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,140
Many people are easily bewitched.

623
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,230
They have an even witchier way to cheat your money.

624
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,890
They'll start with being your friend.

625
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,520
Once you drop your guard, they'll offer to buy trust funds and invest in shares for profit.

626
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,310
That's clearly a lie.

627
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,500
How is it a lie?

628
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,880
Would anyone be that dumb?

629
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,550
Why would someone choose to help an online friend make money

630
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,800
instead of keeping the profits for themselves?

631
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,060
These are the romance scams we describe in our pamphlet.

632
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,630
Listen to this. They offer concern online and win your heart.

633
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,210
Once they gain your trust,

634
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,870
they'll borrow a large sum of money using excuses like setting up a business

635
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,860
or needing money for sick family members.

636
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,740
They might even pretend to have insider information on profitable funds or shares.

637
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,650
Then, they send you phishing sites to get your money.

638
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:22,390
Some scammers will even pretend to be authorized agents.

639
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,870
Xia Xia, are you still dating someone online?

640
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,540
You can't trust someone you don't know.

641
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,120
XIa Xia is in an online relationship?

642
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,290
No, I'm not.

643
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,420
No one will fall for him.

644
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,070
Got it. Keep what I said in mind.

645
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,850
Don't transfer your money.

646
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,490
- Okay, don't transfer money.
- Don't transfer any money.

647
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,070
All right, enjoy your meal.

648
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,560
- We'll continue handing out pamphlets.
- Let's go.

649
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,740
It's hard work.

650
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,370
- See you.
- See you, Xinxin.

651
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,710
Bye-bye.

652
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,700
- Drink more water.
- Okay.

653
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,870
Let's keep going.

654
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,890
You can do this, Xia Xia.

655
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,410
We can do this.

656
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,510
Let's go.

657
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,070
Excuse me! Can you clean this up?

658
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,800
- Hello, President Chen.
- Yes.

659
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,110
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

660
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,370
Could you make me a new cup?

661
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,590
Sure thing. Sorry about that.

662
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,810
Yes, I'm working on the plan.

663
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,550
Na Na, quickly make a cup of Thousand Fragrances.

664
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,180
Got it.

665
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,880
Are you busy?

666
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,170
You're here.

667
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,390
I'm just dropping by.

668
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,290
- Get me a cup of Encounter.
- Okay.

669
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,820
Thanks.

670
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,450
Granny Xiuying, could you sweep the fallen leaves at the entrance?

671
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,820
I'm not sweeping that.

672
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,220
Why not?

673
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,240
The entrance isn't my area. I won't help her.

674
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,610
What's going on? Another quarrel?

675
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,480
Yesterday, my niece visited me with her children,

676
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,470
so I left earlier and asked her to clean the toilet for me.

677
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,440
She agreed to help me, but she didn't.

678
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,720
Every time she goes home early, I help her with her tasks.

679
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,150
It slipped my mind.

680
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,250
Goodness... You haven't changed since you were 20 years old.

681
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,550
I helped your family with harvesting rice.

682
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,100
When my family was picking beans, you were singing in town.

683
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,650
You're so lazy!

684
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,640
That was decades ago.

685
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,580
You've been so petty all your life.

686
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,660
A'Yao, do me justice.

687
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,950
Granny Xiuying isn't petty.

688
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,020
Granny Caiyun isn't lazy either.

689
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,340
She really forgot.

690
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,420
She'll do everything she promises.

691
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,360
I cleaned the place in the morning.

692
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,120
When I arrived this morning, she was almost done with the cleaning.

693
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,060
It really slipped my mind.

694
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,020
Yes, of course.

695
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,060
It might've really slipped her mind.

696
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,970
She often cleans one shelf twice and forgets about the other.

697
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,390
Right?

698
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,300
When you twisted your ankle,

699
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,520
Granny Caiyun brought food to you every day.

700
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,760
That's what I should do. Don't mention it.

701
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,150
Yes, that's what you should do.

702
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,770
You've been good friends; best buddies for years.

703
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,120
Your friendship is deep, and you help each other.

704
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,070
Yes. I'm too petty.

705
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,250
You're not petty.

706
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,410
You always invited me over to eat delicious food when I was young.

707
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,290
You're so generous.

708
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,290
Forget it. It's no big deal.

709
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,470
I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

710
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,360
Sister, forget it.

711
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,580
I know you're getting older, and your memory is getting worse.

712
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,320
It's good to hear that you've sorted things out.

713
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,590
Time to work.

714
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,440
Granny Caiyun, you're in charge of the entrance,

715
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,650
so please sweep the fallen leaves.

716
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,010
If she sweeps now, the leaves will accumulate again.

717
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,790
Let's take a break and have a drink.

718
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,110
Come on.

719
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,770
She's right.

720
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,620
That makes sense.

721
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,510
Problem solved?

722
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,450
Done and dusted.

723
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,980
This is common for them.

724
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,650
They quarrel endlessly over trivial things.

725
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,440
When they're chummy, they're like real sisters.

726
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,350
If they're quarreling, they'll bring up incidents ages ago.

727
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,860
I thought best friends wouldn't quarrel when they get older.

728
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,780
They have more time to quarrel when they're older.

729
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,890
Have you talked to Xu Hongdou about working here?

730
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,420
I did. She doesn't want to.

731
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,330
But she still helps out from time to time.

732
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,180
- That's kind of her.
- Yeah.

733
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,720
Chairman Xie, let's just give up on recruiting her.

734
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,440
We can pay someone else to work as a waitress.

735
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,070
I'm not asking her to be a waitress.

736
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,300
Are you trying to keep her here?

737
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,470
That's impossible.

738
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:53,640
She won't stay here to work.

739
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,250
That's not what I mean.

740
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,390
I know she'll leave us.

741
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,410
Well, what do you mean?

742
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,990
I want her to maximize her existing potential.

743
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,310
I can see that her working style is different from you guys.

744
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,960
You'll unconsciously follow her lead.

745
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,110
Her service makes customers very pleased.

746
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,870
This is the charm of professionalism.

747
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,960
My words couldn't persuade her.

748
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,870
You can try. I doubt you'll succeed.

749
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,120
Don't worry. Let me take the stage.
