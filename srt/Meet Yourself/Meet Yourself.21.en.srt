<i>[Episode 21]</i>

3
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,820
Xiao Huang, please settle the wages of the construction team.

4
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,700
Chairman Xie, I feel really bad,

5
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,810
but please help me find someone to take over the place.

6
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,350
Okay. Leave this to me.

7
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,930
Don't worry.

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
I...

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,450
I don't know how to thank you.

10
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,929
You've been helping me ever since the site selection.

11
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,500
You've done so much for me,

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,259
but I left this mess for you to deal with.

13
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,760
Don't say that.

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,600
We're just doing what we can.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,280
There's nothing more we can help with anymore.

16
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,330
Persevere through this storm.

17
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,380
Things will get better.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,100
Thank you.

19
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,510
All right.

20
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,750
Don't let your emotions get the better of you.

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,500
Keep them in check.

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,720
But I'm upset.

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,730
I know you're upset,

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,670
but returning to the village with tears isn't a pleasant sight.

25
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,220
Don't you feel upset?

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,420
Of course, I am.

27
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,550
I was just lamenting a few days ago about their visit.

28
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,530
Me, too.

29
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,190
I even cursed them.

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,910
You're too mean, Xie Zhiyao.

31
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,460
Do you want me to bawl like you?

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,829
You can't. You have to drive.

33
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,860
They're horrible!

34
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,929
Xiao Huang is a village official, so she should help them.

35
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,419
This is none of your business.

36
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,399
You've been slogging away for free,

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,620
but you're in deep shit now.

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,300
Hold on, Mr. Hu.

39
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,579
Don't stop me.

40
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,629
Here's what he's up to next.

41
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,189
I bet he'll ask you guys to find someone to take over.

42
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,239
After that goes through,

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,160
he'll leave the renovation costs to the construction workers.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,139
You'll be the one in charge.

45
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,079
They'll make sure you can't wash your hands of this.

46
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,979
Mr. Hu, don't just blame them.

47
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,480
- Let me finish—
- Are you crazy?

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,660
Why can't I curse them when you're in this state?

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,980
Preposterous!

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,280
His wife has cancer.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,459
They resigned from their jobs in Shenzhen to set up a homestay here.

52
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,170
Their plan was to live here.

53
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,749
At the start of this year,

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,569
his wife's legs started hurting.

55
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,365
They thought it was a calcium deficiency. When they went to the hospital,

56
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,378
the doctor said it was bone cancer.

57
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,530
It was already in the mid-stage.

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,309
They discussed and thought through this.

59
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,639
They've invested quite a bit in this place, and they didn't want to trouble us any further.

60
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,289
So, they decided to continue building the homestay

61
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,610
while they stayed in Shenzhen for treatment.

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,890
In the end,

63
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,770
their family found out about this.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,030
Everyone was thrown into a panic.

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,680
His father-in-law is in the ICU now from a stroke.

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,190
Their money was depleting rapidly.

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,000
They're really suffering.

68
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,660
That's true.

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,410
It never rains, but it pours.

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,200
Why didn't you say so earlier?

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,329
Before he could even say a word, you were hollering curses.

72
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,050
You didn't listen to Chairman Xie when he tried to interrupt.

73
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,020
Well done.

74
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,270
Let's go.

75
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,700
Well, should we donate some money?

76
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,090
I'll spray one more time.

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,780
Damai, what are you doing?

78
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,699
I have blisters on my feet.

79
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,819
Two on each foot. They're symmetrical.

80
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,520
See?

81
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,660
Are we still going tomorrow?

82
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,259
No way.

83
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,729
Xie Zhiyao said Yang Guanjun will head over.

84
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,820
We don't have to go.

85
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,719
Mr. Hu and I already told Aunty Feng.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,100
We'll arrive later tomorrow.

87
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,809
That's because tomorrow's lunch is roast pork belly.

88
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,430
Aren't you going to upload a new chapter?

89
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,749
I'll head back to writing after I put the plasters on.

90
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,709
If you're out of ideas today, you‘ll be in a fix.

91
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,840
Don't worry, I have extra drafts.

92
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,360
They're enough to last for two days.

93
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,819
Two days? That's a good stock.

94
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,209
Just two days?

95
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,410
That isn't enough to flesh out the heroine's investigations into the water source with the hero.

96
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,409
Stop pretending. I noticed ages ago.

97
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,310
Did you?

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,529
Na Na uses three accounts to comment.

99
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,330
Hongdou has two.

100
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,300
How did you find out?

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,409
It's simple.

102
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,089
These accounts were registered at almost the same time,

103
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,700
and they only commented on my work.

104
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,969
Well, how did you distinguish us?

105
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,820
Through pet phrases and writing style.

106
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,209
When Na Na sends messages,

107
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,930
she likes to use the tilde and "hee hee".

108
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,370
These three accounts are also fixated on refusing haters.

109
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,729
But their quarrels are limited to the same things.

110
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,819
"Your parents worked so hard to raise you."

111
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,050
"Did they do that so you can be an internet troll?"

112
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,529
"You're so mean!"

113
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,760
"You're... internet trash!" So on and so forth.

114
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,919
Even though she comments a lot, she doesn't say anything aggressive.

115
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,110
Hongdou's comments are poetic.

116
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,510
Her words are ethereal.

117
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,619
They give off an impression that she's capable,

118
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:33,099
but it's hard to tell what aspect she's trying to praise.

119
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,740
Here's an example.

120
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,970
"In the writer's novel, time is like the desert, slowly draining one."

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,189
What's the key to making compliments?

122
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,699
That is to be straightforward, bold, intense, unabashed, and overwhelming.

123
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,529
You should let them feel empowered.

124
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:54,969
She should feel like she let this passionate fan down if she doesn't update another 20,000 words.

125
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm just kidding.

126
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,459
I didn't come up with this.

127
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,840
I only saw someone else type this.

128
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,209
I only quarreled with those haters.

129
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,310
I didn't write anything else.

130
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,590
No, it's you.

131
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,170
What's wrong?

132
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,259
All we did was in vain.

133
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,970
You knew it was us.

134
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,720
Actually, even though I knew you wrote those comments,

135
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,730
the encouragement in them

136
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,620
conveyed your care and love to me.

137
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,070
My heart was surging with courage and strength.

138
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,720
I've also made my decision.

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,789
I won't look for a job. I'll continue writing novels.

140
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,339
Really?

141
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,830
Yes. I've already drafted the outline of my next novel.

142
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,999
So, Damai Chadada, you won't stop writing?

143
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,299
I won't. I'll continue.

144
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,790
We're always trapped by the opinions of others,

145
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,410
but we need to understand one thing.

146
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,360
When the flood gushes at you

147
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,720
and you're drowning, it's not your fault.

148
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,760
Well said.

149
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,419
Where's my phone? You didn't bring it over.

150
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,940
I didn't?

151
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,929
I just uttered pearls of wisdom!

152
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,169
Pearls of wisdom!

153
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,569
This is the theme of the water source investigation!

154
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,859
I won't have writer's block tonight, dear sisters!

155
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,100
I'm going to write!

156
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,020
Be careful.

157
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,820

she picked the plums herself.

167
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,450
She packed them at the orchard and sent them over.

168
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,430
They're much cheaper than those in supermarkets.

169
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,969
That's right. She's also helping the orchard workers.

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,649
Guisheng, drive here.

171
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:41,650
I'll pack two boxes for Kexin.

172
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,770
We have plenty of plums.

173
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,450
I sent 20 boxes over.

174
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,170
It's not much, just about 100 catties.

175
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,570
You can make jam with them.

176
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,089
It isn't expensive. The fruits are cheap here.

177
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
Okay.

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,650
Make something delicious for me.

179
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,560
Go on and sort out the plums.

180
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,310
I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

181
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,509
<i>[Nanxing's Mom]</i>

182
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,810
<i>[Sister]</i>

183
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,350
Hello.

184
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,099
You received them?

185
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:29,400
<i>Do you want me to sell plums at the subway exit by sending so many?</i>

186
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,800
It's not much.

187
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,270
You can give them to your friends and your relatives.

188
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,590
Share them with Lingdang's teachers.

189
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,840
<i>How's your vacation?</i>

190
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,959
It's going well. I find this place cozy.

191
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,770
Is it that nice?

192
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,310
Are you hiding something from me?

193
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,960
What?

194
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,970
It's just a feeling.

195
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,390
Sure, continue musing over that feeling.

196
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,090
Okay, bye.

197
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
How is it? Did you get the answer?

198
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,880
Sister Hongdou, can I quit math?

199
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,150
Of course not.

200
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,690
But I don't like math.

201
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,490
Why's that?

202
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,660
<i>Eight plus nine.</i>

203
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,050
<i>Eight plus nine. You couldn't figure it out after 20 minutes?</i>

204
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,129
<i>Mom, don't talk so loudly. I can hear you.</i>

205
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,319
<i>You can hear me?</i>

206
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,469
<i>Fine, let's try again. Come on.</i>

207
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,410
<i>Count.</i>

208
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,599
<i>One.</i>

209
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
<i>Two.</i>

210
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,510
<i>Three.</i>

211
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,690
<i>Four.</i>

212
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,390
<i>Five.</i>

213
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,500
<i>Six.</i>

214
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
<i>Seven.</i>

215
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,310
<i>Eight.</i>

216
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,770
<i>Nine.</i>

217
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,720
<i>Ten.</i>

218
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,970
<i>Eleven.</i>

219
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,319
<i>Twelve.</i>

220
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,630
<i>- Thirteen.
- Okay, stop.</i>

221
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,830
<i>Over here. There's a finger here, right?</i>

222
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,040
<i>Is my finger too short that you can't see it?</i>

223
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,239
<i>Mom, I saw it.</i>

224
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,669
<i>Don't be angry.</i>

225
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,140
<i>I'm not angry.</i>

226
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,939
<i>You can't even solve such a simple question. What can you even do in the future?</i>

227
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,880
<i>Don't stare at me.</i>

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,640
<i>Continue counting. We'll stop only when you figure it out.</i>

229
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,440
<i>Count!</i>

230
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,490
Overcome your obstacles.

231
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,100
Help me just this once. Please.

232
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,150
Only this time.

233
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,509
Do it again. Got it?

234
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:06,287
♫ <i>I've been alone</i> ♫

235
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:09,769
♫ <i>Into the unknown</i> ♫

236
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:17,056
♫ <i>Can navigate through the dark</i> ♫

237
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:24,169
♫ <i>I'm searching for a meadow of mine</i> ♫

238
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:30,880
♫ <i>Till you came in with the breeze</i> ♫

239
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,290
Why are you plagued with troubles?

240
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,840
Nothing ever goes smoothly.

241
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,020
How are you planning to handle the homestay's handover?

242
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,870
It isn't cheap.

243
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,470
Who will buy it?

244
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,030
If Shaohua Bookstore sets up a store here,

245
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,930
I can easily sell the homestay.

246
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,900
What if nobody invests in the place?

247
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,050
I'll run the place myself.

248
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,760
Do you have the money?

249
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,790
Nope.

250
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,690
Well, how will you run it?

251
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll go searching for money.

252
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,170
That's easy to say.

253
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,140
You make money sound like mushrooms.

254
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,770
Will they grow after the rain?

255
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,030
Are you sure you can get money just because you go looking?

256
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,760
Why didn't I study hard back then?

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,439
If I went to college, I could help you now.

258
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,909
You stayed here and set up a barbecue stand here.

259
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,133
When I am hungry at night,

260
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,950
I don't need to go far for good food.

261
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,860
You can even join me for drinks often

262
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,410
and listen to my laments.

263
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,740
That's already a great help to me.

264
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,340
You're right.

265
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,650
Everyone's pinning their hopes on you.

266
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,880
Who can you turn to?

267
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,960
You're shouldering large burdens.

268
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Everyone has their own troubles.

269
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,520
It's no big deal.

270
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,129
All right. Come down.

271
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:21,610
Don't fall.

272
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,550
Xu Hongdou ordered takeout.

273
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,620
You can bring it to her.

274
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,784
What did she order?

275
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,040
I won't tell you.

276
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,269
She likes shrimp. Take this.

277
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,620
She already ordered it.

278
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,779
The eggplant. Take a big one.

279
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,520
Can you shut up?

280
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,320
The vegetables.

281
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,339
- Watch the fire when you're barbecuing. Add less oil—
- You want to do it?

282
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,070
I'll let you cook.

283
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,250
Why are you standing outside the courtyard?

284
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,639
Yang Guanjun told me that you were drinking.

285
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,919
I was afraid you'd end up sleeping in the alley.

286
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,740
I'm here to pick you up.

287
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,870
Haven't you had dinner?

288
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,919
I did.

289
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,850
I ordered this for Damai and Mr. Hu.

290
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,490
You drank quite a bit.

291
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,820
Not really.

292
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,399
Are you still stocked up on alcohol?

293
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,780
How about treating me to some drinks?

294
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,130
Okay. Let's go.

295
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,140
Here's your drink.

296
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,210
Milk?

297
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,439
You're drunk so late at night.

298
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,060
When Granny sees you, she'll be worried.

299
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,760
Drink some milk.

300
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,240
Did you add sugar?

301
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,840
It's honey.

302
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,930
Are you okay?

303
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,590
I was fine before your question.

304
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,200
Now that you're asking me, I'm starting to feel depressed.

305
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,000
How should I put this?

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,160
It's a little hard to express.

307
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,870
After my meeting with Old Li,

308
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,100
the owner of the homestay,

309
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,240
my heart was in a tangled mess.

310
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,850
That's understandable.

311
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,550
I often met his wife.

312
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,090
She would always treat us to a meal when she visited.

313
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,830
She said that after the homestay was built,

314
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,000
she'd invite her parents over to enjoy their old age.

315
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,820
Her child is only two years old.

316
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,960
He could attend the town's kindergarten.

317
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,260
Even if their place wasn't profitable,

318
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,620
the property prices here are cheap.

319
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,490
They could make ends meet.

320
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,140
Look at things now.

321
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,690
She's such a nice person and still so young.

322
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,490
Her child is just a baby.

323
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,860
She still has a long way to go.

324
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,880
Why did she suddenly get cancer?

325
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,170
My mom once told me this.

326
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,910
Death doesn't discriminate between the young and old.

327
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,290
You never know when and how

328
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,690
a person will leave this world.

329
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,630
So,

330
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,970
when I think of this,

331
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,100
I feel...

332
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,970
I feel afraid.

333
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,010
Afraid?

334
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,410
I'll put it this way.

335
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,210
So many people have their hopes pinned on me.

336
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,450
If I contract a serious illness

337
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,170
or get into an accident

338
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,960
and suddenly lose my life,

339
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,720
they'll be left with such a mess.

340
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,730
What's going to happen to them?

341
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,260
The thought of this makes me feel...

342
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,440
I feel at a loss.

343
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,050
Distress, anxiety, fear,

344
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,410
and a sense of uncertainty overwhelms me.

345
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,010
Do you think I'm letting my thoughts get ahead of me?

346
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,210
I understand how you feel.

347
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,970
How can a man like me be so emotional?

348
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,099
Just leave me be. Don't mind me.

349
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,800
I truly understand how you feel.

350
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,420
I really do.

351
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,350
Trust me.

352
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,310
It's like missing a step.

353
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,100
A feeling of anxiety, fear,

354
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:25,140
uncertainty toward the future,

355
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,970
and a lack of security.

356
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,260
How should I put this?

357
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,780
It's like you're in a desert.

358
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,550
When you look about,

359
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,540
there's nothing around you.

360
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,680
You don't know where to go either.

361
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,340
I assumed you couldn't understand this feeling.

362
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,990
I'm going to my room. Can you walk?

363
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,839
I can, but isn't it too late?

364
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,440
I want to show you something.

365
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,890
Close the door. Don't let the mosquitos in.

366
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,750
I want to share the story of my dearest person with you.

367
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,250
Didn't you forbid me from looking at this?

368
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,010
Why are you showing it to me now?

369
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,930
I wasn't prepared back then.

372
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,269
Xie Zhiyao. A decent person.

373
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:28,489
Am I just a decent person to you?

374
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,310
I was just starting to write these.

375
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,000
Why are you writing such things?

376
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,150
They're for her.

377
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,620
Who is she?

378
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,730
Chen Nanxing.

379
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,040
Chen Nanxing is a girl?

380
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,980
Isn't Chen Nanxing your ex-boyfriend?

381
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,710
She's the dearest person to me.

382
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,590
My best friend,

383
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,600
and she will always be.

384
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,369
Are you writing these for her because she's too busy to join you here?

385
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:26,910
She passed away from cancer.

386
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,900
I really empathize with everything you said.

387
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,820
Perhaps I understand the feeling even better than you do.

388
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,110
A peer by my side, someone who has come this far with me,

389
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,950
suddenly encounters a terrible tragedy.

390
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,840
Our hearts will tremble as well.

391
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,970
It's like being trapped in a nightmare.

392
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,270
It's like missing a step on a high ladder.

393
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,130
It's like a plane vanishing from the radar.

394
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,920
It's like getting lost in a desert.

395
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,709
It's like a polar bear sitting on melting ice and unable to find solid footing.

396
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,909
It's hard for me to express my fears, anxieties,

397
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:33,210
and doubts about life.

398
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,060
What am I?

399
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,440
Even my best friend‘s death...

400
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,440
barely made a difference to my life.

401
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,500
I still go to work and come home, go shopping and watch movies.

402
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,650
I'd only miss her when I feel terribly alone and depressed.

405
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,280
I think...

406
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,750
I think I...

407
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,270
I'm not worthy of grieving her passing for so long.

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,130
Your moral standards for yourself are too harsh.

411
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,550
Anguish and how long it lasts...

412
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,200
doesn't have any prerequisites.

413
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,810

At that time,

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,100
I didn't want to disrupt my work.

418
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,590
I wanted a promotion.

419

The bread is soft and delicious.

Seems like I need to add less chocolate spread.

446
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,200
The meat should be more scorched.

00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,969
- Dream on. Do you still want to watch it?
- Okay.

494
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:13,520
♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

495
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:16,937
It's wonderful.

496
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:19,300
Where is this place?

497
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,489
There aren't any effects added, right?

498
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,810
- It's really the milky way.
- Yes.

499
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,339
Brother took me there two years ago.

500
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:29,189
We drove the jeep there. There were so many stars. It was dazzling.

501
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,940
I want to go there.

502
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,659
I knew you guys would want to go there.

503
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:37,949
So, I'm organizing another bonding activity.

504
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,719
Again?

505
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,529
Who needs free labor this time?

506
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:44,219
This time isn't a lie.

507
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,859
You guys worked hard at picking plums,

508
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:49,141
so I'll organize a fun camping trip.

509
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:50,620
Can I come along?

510
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,799
I also picked plums for two days.

511
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,300
Fine, I'll let you come along.

512
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,800
Will you join us to have some fun?

513
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,900
That place is gorgeous. You can take beautiful pictures.

514
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,910
When are you leaving?

515
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,060
Tomorrow afternoon. We can camp there for a night and return the next day. Your work won't be disrupted.

516
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,549
- Okay. I'll invite the rest through the group chat.
- Okay.

517
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,799
Great. Leave the rest of the preparations to me.

518
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:14,000
Meeting dismissed!

519
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,182
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

520
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:20,660
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

521
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:27,620
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

522
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,350
It's so quiet and soothing.

523
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,510
It feels like we're the only ones in this world.

524
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,470
You're right.

525
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,120
Inspiration for my new novel is coming to me.

526
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,399
Enough, Damai. Don't be distracted.

527
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,740
Finish the current ending first.

528
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,620
Okay.

529
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,250
Come over and help with setting up the tent!

530
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,360
Coming!

531
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,010
Get to work.

532
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,130
How do we do this?

533
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,669
Hold this. I'll stick the stake into the ground.

534
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:01,880
Mr. Hu! Why are you slacking off again, Mr. Hu?

535
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,069
Come over and help out.

536
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:05,420
He's pretending to be deaf.

537
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,749
Mr. Hu, aren't you going to move your hands and help out?

538
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:21,190
You can't ask an artist to dirty his hands.

539
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,780
Xia Xia! Stop picking wood.

540
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,569
Come here. Have some coffee.

541
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:28,560
We can always put our faith in Xiao Huang.

542
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,790
I'm not an artist.

543
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,809
I'm elevating your status, but you refuse my kindness.

544
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,300
Let's pick some firewood.

545
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,500
We should gather more. It'll be cold after sunset.

546
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,190
Let's go.

547
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,750
That way.

548
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,670
Pick the thinner ones.

549
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,040
- Yes.
- Okay, those are good.

550
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,260
How I wish I could fall in love.

551
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,239
Don't jump to conclusions. They can't be a couple.

552
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,270
Why not?

553
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,449
They aren't married,

554
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,390
and they're fond of each other.

555
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,550
Hongdou's lease will end next month, right?

556
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,699
Good kids, here's what you don't know.

557
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:30,010
A time limit...

558
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:35,690
sparks a brief and passionate love most easily.

559
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,090
Do you agree with him?

560
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,990
Yes, I do.

561
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm experienced.

562
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:53,520
The girl started by saying,

563
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,489
"When you're singing to me,

564
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:58,510
a special feeling bubbles within me.“

565
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,130
"It's love."

566
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,460
When I just started enjoying the fragrance of love,

567
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,170
she sent me a message and told me

568
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,840
it was all a dream.

569
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,760
I should wake up.

570
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,770
I asked why.

571
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,320
Guess what happened.

572
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,910
What happened?

573
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,350
She blocked me.

574
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,639
The lighting here is good. I'll take a photo for you.

575
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,110
Love comes and goes like a hurricane.

576
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,330
Even though I agree with him,

577
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,099
I think... Hongdou and Chairman Xie are rational people.

578
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,829
They won't begin a relationship they can't be responsible for.

579
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:41,820
One's reason can stop one from starting a relationship,

580
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,510
but it can't prevent one from developing feelings.

581
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,760
Na Na, what do you think of a story

582
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,149
about a female president going on a trip,

583
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,489
coincidentally meeting an overbearing village beau,

584
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,110
and then help him with his business venture?

585
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:09,040
♫ <i>Don't know where to go</i> ♫

586
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,810
I can already see the scene in my mind.

587
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,869
Include me in your story.

588
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,770
No way.

589
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,220
Can't I just be a minor character?

590
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,230
Nope.

591
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,499
Come on. Cheers.

592
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:31,489
- Come on.
- Cheers!

593
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,710
<i>Cheers!</i>

594
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,949
This sweet potato is delicious. It's really sweet.

595
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:44,079
Lately, everything tastes amazing to me.

596
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,849
Me, too. Aunty Feng's cooking is amazing.

597
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,869
So, people have to work more and put in more effort.

598
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,800
This potato is tastiest with salt and pepper.

599
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,010
It's enough.

600
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,860
Drink less coffee. You won't be able to sleep at night.

601
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,950
I'm not sleeping. I'll stargaze for the whole night.

602
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,730
Do it if you aren't afraid of the cold.

603
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:22,210
This is wonderful. It's great that we can gather together.

604
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,899
It's a pity! Mr. Ma isn't here!

605
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,080
We'll have everyone with him around, and that's even better!

606
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,330
Damai! When are you leaving?

607
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,110
I'm leaving next week.

608
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,240
I told Xiaochun that I'd check out next week.

609
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
Can't you stay for a few more days?

610
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,900
I've been out for too long.

611
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,960
My parents keep calling to ask me to go back.

612
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,400
- Have you told your dad that you won't look for a job?
- Yeah.

613
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,969
I even promised him this.

614
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,770
I'll leave the house at least four days a week.

615
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,320
That's more like it.

616
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,310
Damai, Will you come back and visit us?

617
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,409
Of course. I'll come back and live here again next year.

618
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:05,780
Will you guys still be around?

619
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,389
I don't know if they'll be around, but I'll definitely be here. I have nowhere else to go.

620
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,738
I'll be here, too.

621
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:11,759
You have nowhere else to go, too?

622
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,339
That's great.

623
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,119
I'll save a room for you, and give you a discount.

624
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,139
There's no need for that. She can sleep in my room. She doesn't need to pay.

625
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,100
Chairman Xie, you always behave like a shrewd merchant at such moments.

626
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,440
Thank you for your praise.

627
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,240
I'm a proper shrewd merchant, while you pretend to be one.

628
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,609
I heard you only charged ¥200

629
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:35,010
for Mr. Ma's teahouse love story.

630
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,490
That's just my principle.

631
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,459
I can give friends a discount, but I won't write for free.

632
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,330
I really admire that about you!

633
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,770
Once Damai leaves,

634
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,950
there won't be anyone inviting me for noodles at night.

635
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:01,709
Dear friend, don't be sad. We're just passing guests at a banquet.

636
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:05,589
We'll leave once we finish eating, but we'll come again the next day.

637
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:07,420
That's right.

638
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,139
Mr. Hu, this is the perfect moment for you to grace us with a song.

639
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:14,760
That's right!

640
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,320
Sure. What do you want to listen to?

641
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,319
I'm not like you guys. I won't charge a cent.

642
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,130
How about "The Price of Love"?

643
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,149
What's the song you sang in your room last night?

644
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:24,750
It was pretty nice.

645
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,310
That's my new song.

646
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,410
Sing that.

647
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,120
My new song, "Wind." Please enjoy.

648
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,330
Clap!

649
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,090
