3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
- Cut off this string.
- Okay.

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
This can be a little longer.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Ma'am, Master Xie is here.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Heshun.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
- Big Sister.
- Come over here.

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Li Qing, make a pot of tea.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
- No, don't bother.
- Come on.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm just dropping by. I'll leave right away.

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Sit down for a bit.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Come on.

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm just being a hassle to you.

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,600
Not at all. Sit over here.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Our embroidery workshop has been established for so long,

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
but you never came to take a look.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
It's out of the way.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Master Xie, you came at the perfect time.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,100
Ma'am and I just returned from Xinjiang last night.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,600
Why did you go to Xinjiang?

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
For an intangible cultural heritage exhibition.

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,500
What's that?

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
It's just an exhibition.

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,800
It showcases the handicrafts of various intangible cultural heritages around the country.

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
It's a rather big event with a large crowd.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
We sold quite a bit of items there.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
You can d retail there?

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Of course. There are booths for us.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Here, have some tea.

31
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,900
Okay.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Gezi is responsible for the showcase of embroideries and tie-dye items.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,800
She also handles the promotion of physical stores.

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Xiaolan oversees the online craft store.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Craftsmen like us just have to focus on our crafts.

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Each of us works on our specialties.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,400
Sister, how big are your business goals?

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
The bigger the better, of course.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Times are different now.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,500
The world progresses too rapidly.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,100
If no one knows about our craft, we'll become obsolete.

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,500
Why should the state protect intangible cultural heritages?

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
They fear such folk crafts will be lost.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
That's why more promotions are needed.

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,000
The younger generation can learn about such practices and be charmed by them.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Only then will people be willing to pick up such skills

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
and pay for their production.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
That's how we can ensure the longevity of our crafts.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,300
In the past, masters simply passed on their crafts to their apprentices.

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,000
That's all they needed to do.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Now, we need to help these younger ones earn money.

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Good morning, Blackie.

53

54
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Breakfast is ready. Want to eat?

55
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Come on.

57
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,700
Mr. Ma, want to eat with us?

58
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me get some soup.

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Meals are more delicious with soup.

60
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
Are these shredded potatoes with vinegar?

61
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Why did you add dark soy sauce to it?

62
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
That's how my mom cooks it.

63
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Mothers are always right.

64
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,000
- It's delicious.
- Tasty, right?

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,300
This is perfect. The taste is amazing.

66
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,500
I'll have some more.

67
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Nice. Tasty.

68
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,100
Zhiyao.

69
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,000
Let me do the introductions, President Li.

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
This is Xie Zhiyao. He's my good friend.

71
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,700
President Li, nice to meet you.

72
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,000
Hello, Chairman Xie.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
- How did you get here?
- I drove here.

74
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,300
You can't drink, then?

75
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,000
I definitely can. I have a driver with me.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
You came prepared. Not bad.

77
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Come on. Have a sit.

78
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Chairman Xie, please.

79
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,900
- You can take a seat first.
- Here, Brother Li.

80
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
Chariman Xie.

81
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Your things aren't bad.

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know they're excellent,

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
but they're expensive.

84
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Machine carvings only cost a few hundred yuan for wall decor.

85
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,300
Ordinary folks can't even tell the difference.

86
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm running a luxury art hotel.

87
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,200
I'd rather save the money and upgrade our bedding.

88
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,500
President Li, you're an honest person.

89
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Since you're frank with me, I'll be honest too.

90
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
I definitely want to seal the deal with you this time,

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
but I really mean well for your hotel.

92
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,100
You're branding yourself with China chic.
<i>("China chic" refers to native Chinese traditions turning trendy)</i>

93
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,400
You hope to make traditional culture a feature of your art hotel.

94
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Then, you should use hand-carved items.

95
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Please elaborate.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
He knows I used to be an investor.

97
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
I listened to endless stories every day.

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
A good entrepreneur must first be a storyteller.

99
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,700
The more compelling your story is,

100
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,400
the more willing others will be to invest in you.

101
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Look at your hotel.

102
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,300
China chic, traditional culture,

103
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,000
and high-quality are all present.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You just lack a good story.

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Go on.

106
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Let me tell you a story first.

107
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,290
A young man grew up in a fishing village near the sea.

108
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,600
As a child, he was always left alone at home while his parents worked.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,000
Eventually, he got into a university in Beijing and found a decent job.

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,600
However, his heart was set on returning to his hometown to start a business.

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
He set up a web store to sell agricultural products from his hometown.

112
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
He hired the villagers around him.

113
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,200
He helped an embroidery inheritor of intangible cultural heritage set up a workshop.

114
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,600
He invested in tie-dye workshops and preserved the traditional crafts in this hometown.

115
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
He also developed the tourism there

116
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,600
and encouraged youngsters to work locally instead of leaving.

117
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,200
As a result, the children were no longer left behind.

118
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,600
The elderly were no longer left behind either.

119
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Why does this sound so familiar?

120
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
I think I've seen something similar on television.

121
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a cliche story about someone

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
who returns home to start a business.

123
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
All similarities are just coincidences.

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Such cliched stories are useless to me.

125
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
It's useful.

126
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
There's a segment you can adopt.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What is it?

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
There's a boss who loves traditional culture.

129
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
He thinks Chinese traditional crafts should be promoted

130
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
and spread to more people.

131
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
So, he set up an art hotel

132
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,500
filled with handicrafts of intangible cultural heritage.

133
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Even the wood carvings decorating the corridors

134
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,100
were carved by skilled masters meticulously.

135
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Doesn't this make up a wonderful story?

136
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
That's right. This is actually true about Brother Li.

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Isn't that so?

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
He loves Chinese traditional culture.

139
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,100
Exactly.

140
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,800
That's me.

141
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Here, President Li.

142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
- Don't call me that. We're brothers.
- Brother!

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
- Come on.
- Here.

144
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
Take it easy.

145
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
Liu, thank you!

146
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't thank me. Get some rest.

147
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Sir, keep an eye on him.

148
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
- Make sure he doesn't puke.
- Okay.

149
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,600
- You can go.
- Okay.

150
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

151
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Granny.

152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,100
You're back.

153
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,800
I bought your favorite smoked ribs.

154
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,900
So, you still remember I like those?

155
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,000
Did you drink?

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
A little.

157
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
How did it go?

158
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Not bad.

159
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,500
I sealed the deal.

160
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
Really?

161
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Here you go. A reward for you.

162
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
It's sweet.

163
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
Sweet indeed.

164
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,900
A'Yao and I have been friends since we were kids.

165
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,600
He used to eat at my home all the time.

166
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,400
We went to middle school together and lived at school.

167
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,800
We also lived in the high school dormitory together.

168
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
It was tough.

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
I sucked at my studies.

170
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
I didn't get into a college.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
After that, my family introduced a girl to me.

172
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
When I met her,

173
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,000
I realized she was my middle school crush.

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,800
In the end, the first thing she asked me was A'Yao's number.

175
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Isn't that outrageous?

176
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
Did you give it to her?

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,100
Yeah, I did.

178
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,200
I'd seem so petty if I didn't.

179
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
A'Yao was busy studying and clinching scholarships back then.

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
He didn't have time to be fooling around with girls.

181
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,100
When he graduated from college, I asked him if he'd come back.

182
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
He told me he got into graduate school.

183
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,800
I asked him how much of a bigwig he was planning to be with all that studying.

184
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Well, he's a proper boss now.

185
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,400
He's managing his own business now.

186
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Yeah, he's a big boss now.

187
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,800
He invested tons in the years he's been here.

188
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
But has he made any money?

189
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Not much at all.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
He always says this is the development stage when people probe him.

191
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't understand anyway.

192
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,400
In my opinion, he's much better off

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
working as an angel investor in Beijing.

194
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
He had a high salary and bonus.

195
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
What are you talking about this time?

196
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,500
You scared me.

197
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,000
- What are you chatting about?
- Nothing much.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
About barbecuing and your college days.

199
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,400
What do you want to eat?

200
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
I've already eaten.

201
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,200
Can you get me some vegetables?

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,300
Sure.

203
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,600
I'll take it over to you once they're ready.

204
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

205
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>[Little A'Yuan]</i>
Don't bother. His phone is off.

206
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
You're more like his sister.

207
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,900
I really want to explain this misunderstanding.

208
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,100
I really didn't say a word.

209
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,200
Who do you think spread this news?

210
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,000
I have no clue.

211
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,800
The walls in the village look pretty thick,

212
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
but there are holes everywhere.

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
There's no point in keeping secrets.

214
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
I saw you hanging out at the cafe for the past few days.

215
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
Didn't you go out to explore?

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Where should I go?

217
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
The tie-dye workshop.

218
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,100
You can experience the dyeing process.

219
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
I did it in the afternoon.

220
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,800
The wood carving workshop next to the cafe.

221
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,600
I bought something there.

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,500
How about the bamboo raft?

223
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,400
I took it.

224
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Try horseback riding. It's interesting.

225
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
- I won't go.
- Why not?

226
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
I don't like it.

227
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Oh, yeah.

228
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,600
There's a large campground to the east of the village.

229
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,800
You can pick vegetables, fish, and barbecue there.

230
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,200
A friend from Beijing runs it.

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,400
Is he losing money?

232
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
It's just not profitable yet.

233
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Take Damai and Na Na there when you have time.

234
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Let me tell you this.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,600
Stop trying to promote those manmade attractions.

236
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm here to find someplace where nobody knows me.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm serious about being a useless piece of trash.

238
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,826
When did you have such a noble ambition?

239
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,100
Before I started work,

240
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,200
all I did was study.

241
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,400
After I got employed, all I did was work.

242
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,170
I've worked hard endlessly.

243
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I didn't like losing or falling behind.

244
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,500
You know, I saved enough money by graduation...

245
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
to buy a place of a few square meters.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Ten years have passed.

247
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
I've saved some money,

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but I realized I could only buy the same few square meters

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,600
when I checked the real estate website.

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,300
I have no house, no car, and no partner.

251
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
All I gained was an illness.

252
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,600
Are you that miserable?

253
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Isn't there a saying online?

254
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,200
What's it?

255
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,500
You're mediocre at your job.

256
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,600
Your performance is mediocre.

257
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,200
The only thing that stands out is your herniated disc.

258
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,600
That's a perfect description of me.

259
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,380
Look.

260
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Even the arch of my foot is gone.

261
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
I've always been on my feet

262
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
that my feet are flat now.

263
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Why are you laughing?

264
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,800
Hey, can't you be more empathetic?

265
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,500
Nobody would laugh so badly when others are lamenting about pain.

266
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,200
You've flattened the arch of your foot?

267
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,600
That's not funny!

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm sorry!

269
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
I... I'm not mocking you.

270
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,800
I just think you're blessed if you can make others so tickled.

271
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Here's what I think.

272
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,900
People shouldn't push themselves too much

273
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,800
or they'll break down.

274
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,600
All kinds of illnesses like cynicism, escapism,

275
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,500
anxiety, and frustration will haunt you.

276
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,400
Do you think I can choose how much to push myself?

277
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,200
People are just like a clock.

278
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,700
If you don't tick until you're broken,

279
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
no one wants to get a replacement.

280
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,200
I think you are a rather good catch.

281
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
If you put on makeup and tidy up,

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,600
you'd look like a beauty.

283
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,900
You shouldn't have problems finding a good partner.

284
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's say that I go for a man with prospects

285
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,600
and he likes me for my looks.

286
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
I may still be a beauty after a few years,

287
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,100
but are his prospects still looking good?

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Must you be so rational about everything?

289
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Only what you have is your own.

290
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Here's to you.

291
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,800
Wait! What are you drinking?

292
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I drank at noon.

293
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
I'll be an alcoholic if I drink again.

294
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Life as a child was the best.

295
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
I always looked forward to the holidays.

296
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Then, I'd go to my grandma's place.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I'd raise chicks,

298
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,300
climb trees, pick wild mulberries,

299
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
and catch shrimp in the stream.

300
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,800
Were you such a naughty child?

301
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,600
Don't you think times were great as a child?

302
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,800
Once we grow up, we're occupied with studying and examinations.

303
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
When we start working, we have to meet expectations at work.

304
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,500
We don't have time for fun.

305
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
You're right.

306
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
You know what?

307
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,400
I always think of my grandma when I see your granny.

308
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,000
Are they alike? In what way?

309
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Probably their demeanor.

310
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,100
They share the same fragrance.

311
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,600
My grandma died three years ago.

312
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
That smell vanished from my life.

313
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,362
What does my granny smell like?

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
She smells like baked bread.

315
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
Very warm.

316
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,300
Tell me about you.

317
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,100
Why did you decide to return home and start a business?

318
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
To make money.

319
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm just living off the land.

320
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Even if others come to invest,

321
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,500
I have the greatest advantage as a local.

322
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,300
That's true.

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
<i>Just a little contouring is fine.</i>

324
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,000
<i>Actually, it's good for guys to have a little makeup on.</i>

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Why are you so careless?

326
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
It's okay.

327
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

328
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
Okay.

329
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it.

330
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,000
It's okay.

331
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,000
It's fine. I'm okay.

332
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It was given by the girl at the front desk.

333
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,700
I've already brought them all over anyway.

334
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,900
Does your arm hurt?

335
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
It doesn't.

336
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,600
It doesn't hurt, but you can't lift it up.

337
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
You almost spilled the entire dish on her head.

338
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,400
Doesn't school seem much better now?

339
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
What's with the crappy weather?

340
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,000
There's no wind.

341
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
All done.

342
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,800
Get your wages for this week's work this weekend.

343
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
After that, go home.

344
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,900
You're too spoiled to be doing this.

345
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,000
I won't go home.

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
No one in my family is even looking for me.

347
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,000
You're just too pampered by your family.

348
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,900
I wish A'Yao was my elder brother.

349
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,400
Fine, you can have him.

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,500
If only that were possible.

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
What about you?

352
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,900
Are you going to continue working like this?

353
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,743
It's pretty good.

354
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,800
Nobody interferes in your life.

355
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
Well, how do I put this?

356
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
My parents got divorced when I was a child.

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,200
They each have their own families.

358
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
I lived with my grandpa.

359
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,200
He passed away,

360
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
and I lived with my grandma.

361
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
She passed away this year.

362
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,800
My mom called me to live with her.

363
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,000
She's in Ruili.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,600
I went there and saw a family of four

365
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
crammed up in a small house of 60 square meters.

366
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,800
The two sisters were sleeping in a bunk bed.

367
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
There's no room for me.

368
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
So, I called my dad.

369
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,300
The number is no longer in service.

370
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,400
You don't know how great it is to have your parents, your brother,

371
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,600
and your grandma to keep you in line.

372
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,800
In fact, Youfeng Courtyard doesn't require much effort.

373
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Right now, I'm working between the web store warehouse and the cafe.

374
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm a little busy, but I can handle it.

375
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,300
Don't put on a strong front.

376
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,000
The warehouse requires a lot of attention.

377
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,800
If you have too much on your plate, we can hire someone for the cafe.

378
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,500
There's no need for now. Let's save some costs.

379
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Anyway, Xiaoyue is always there.

380
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
If something crops up when I'm out,

381
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Xiaoyue can call me.

382
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
I think it's fine too.

383
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Everyone is working on their tasks diligently,

384
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
but the relationships are a little complex.

385
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,400
So, we always need the manager to mediate.

386
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
That's the same old problem then.

387
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,400
Yeah, it's an old problem.

388
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
They're all elders. They know me too well.

389
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,100
They don't draw the line.

390
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,800
No one treats me as the manager.

391
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Moreover, the ladies in the village drop by to chat

392
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
during working hours when they're bored.

393
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Aunty E packaged two orders wrongly in just three days.

394
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,400
If I nag at them, they'll improve briefly.

395
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,600
Though, they'll revert to how they were in a few days.

396
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,800
It's especially so for those grannies, who are like kindergarteners.

397
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,000
If I nag too much, they'll get angry.

398
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The cafe has the same issue.

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,800
This is an inevitable problem when hiring acquaintances.

400
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
I can only tell you to keep a close eye on them.

401
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Emphasize the need to uphold good standards at work

402
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,200
and the need to obey their supervisors.

403
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,100
Brother, I just think we're too chummy with them.

404
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,000
There are too many considerations and too many emotional factors.

405
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,300
Xiaochun.

406
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,000
How about we find an outsider to manage them?

407
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
Let's start with the cafe.

408
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,400
We'll start from one point and slowly regulate management.

409
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
We'll even be able to increase service awareness.

410
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
That'll work.

411
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
It'll be great if that works.

412
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Do you have someone particular in mind?

413
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,900
Of course. She came knocking herself.

414
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,300
- Who is it?
- Xu Hongdou, Manager Xu.

415
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,200
She just resigned from the front-line service of a five-star hotel.

416
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,600
Her experience is top class.

417
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
Forget it.

418
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
She quit and came here to rest.

419
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,800
Why would she agree to work with us?

420
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,700
I have my ways.

421
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,400
I can tell that Xu Hongdou is an industrious and kind person.

422
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Most importantly, she's rather fond of my granny.

423
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,800
These aforementioned weaknesses—

424
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
Hold on, weaknesses?

425
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Xie Zhiyao, what do you mean?

426
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,400
Are you going to recite that story about returning home to start a business again?

427
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Emotional blackmail.

428
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,800
Why do you make my business methods sound so foul?

429
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
You're just sugarcoating it.

430
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,400
A'Yao.

431
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,400
- Uncle.
- Uncle.

432
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Master Xie.

433
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,400
Uncle, have some tea.

434
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Okay.

435
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I guess this deal will keep you occupied for months.

436
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
Don't think too much about this.

437
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
I didn't do that much anyway.

438
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,300
I just had a meal with President Li.

439
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,200
It's all because he took a personal fancy to it.

440
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,600
In the past, there was a budget issue.

441
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,800
A'Yao.

442
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's sit down and chat. Come on.

443
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Please have a seat.

444
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,200
A'Yao, I did say that

445
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,400
the internet is full of nonsense.

446
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Look at the stuff those internet addicts watch.

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,600
It's all about the good life others have.

448
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,700
They own luxury cars and houses.

449
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,600
People become famous one after another.

450
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,200
They're making millions again!

451
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,700
What's this?

452
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,700
This is poison!

453
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,400
It's too toxic!

454
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Youngsters who consume this all day long

455
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
can't possibly concentrate on their work.

456
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,900
They grow impatient and can't get decent jobs.

457
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,600
A few hundred or a few thousand yuan

458
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,400
no longer money to them.

459
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,600
They're obsessed with earning millions.

460
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
Yeah.

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,800
When you just came back,

462
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,600
you told me you'd help me

463
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,800
with branding and promotion.

464
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,700
You'd make money with the woodcarvers.

465
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,600
You said the government wanted to revitalize the countryside

466
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
and develop tourism.

467
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,500
You were planning to establish the infrastructure back here. Right?

468
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,600
You wanted to develop your hometown.

469
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Please don't be offended by my honesty.

470
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,200
I didn't believe a single word you said.

471
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,400
I thought you'd been led astray after all those years away.

472
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,600
When you came back, you wanted to find an easy way to make millions, didn't you?

473
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,800
You're not the only one who said that.

474
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,400
People doubt what they don't understand.

475
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
It's normal.

476
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,600
In the past,

477
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,200
a real craftsman would draw customers easily.

478
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Things have changed.

479
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,600
There was a need to meet the demand.

480
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,500
Right now, we need to create a demand.

481
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,600
Even my granny said that the world has changed.

482
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
Yeah.

483
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,000
Times have changed.

484
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,000
There's no mistake.

485
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Mom.

486
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,600
<i>Xiaochun, Xia Xia took his bank card with him.</i>

487
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,300
I told you that you should let him keep it.

488
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,400
<i>I'm just worried he'll splurge on games.</i>

489
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,200
<i>Hey, how did he know where I left my key?</i>

490
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,400
Even Xiao Hu Lu knows. Why wouldn't he know?

491
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
All right. Just let him take it.

492
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Anyway, he needs money in Shanghai.

493
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
<i>He should've told me.</i>

494
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,300
<i>It's not like I wouldn't give it to him.</i>

495
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,600
He doesn't have the guts to tell you.

496
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,700
You're so strict with him all the time.

497
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>All right. That's all I wanted to say.</i>

498
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
What's with this old lady?

499
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,200
<i>[Xia Xia]</i>

500
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
<i>Hello?</i>

501
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
Let me tell you something.

502
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,400
Mom knows you took the bank card.

503
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,300
Well, I'll transfer ¥3,000 to you through WeChat.

504
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,000
Try not to spend the money with the card.

505
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
Do you hear me?

506
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
<i>Yeah. You don't have to transfer the money. I brought cash with me.</i>

507
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
All right. Have fun over there.

508
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Got to go, I need to work.

509
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Does Aunty Baoping keep Xia Xia's card?

510
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,400
My mom asked him to deposit ¥2,000 in the card every month.

511
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
It's for his marriage.

512
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,400
It's not much, just ¥20,000 to ¥30,000.

513
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Xia Xia is pretty frugal anyway.

514
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
When his white T-shirt was yellowing,

515
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,100
he dyes it at the tie-dye workshop and kept wearing it.

516
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,400
Did he steal the card to buy stocks?

517
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
The stock market has been booming lately.

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
The market rise has trended online several times.

519
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,900
He won't.

520
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,300
You're from a well-to-do family, so you're unlike us.

521
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,000
Xia Xia and I have been dirt poor since we were young.

522
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,400
We know it's hard to make money.

523
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,100
We spend very sparingly.

524
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,700
We wouldn't take risks with stuff we don't understand.

525
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,900
That's good.

526
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,800
He asked me about it the other day.

527
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,000
I told him never to touch stocks.

528
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
It's way too risky.

529
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,600
Young man, how can I help you?

530
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,200
- I want to report a crime.
- What happened?

531
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
I've been cheated of my money.

532
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Did you send a friend money through an ATM?

533
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,100
Not an ATM. It's a fund website.

534
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Someone recommended it to me.

535
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
I had no problem registering and depositing money.

536
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
After that, I couldn't log in anymore.

537
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,600
The man gave me his address in Shanghai.

538
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
I sent something to this address.

539
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,200
When I reported the case there, they told me to go to the crime region.

540
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
So, I rushed back.

541
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,000
Young man, you've got a clear mind.

542
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,200
How did you fall for this butchering scam?
<i>(Money scams involving emotional manipulation.)</i>

543
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
Butchering?

544
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
It's nothing.

545
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Come over here to take a statement.

546
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,100
Okay.

547
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,200
They asked me how A'Yuan's mom treated you.

548
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Why are they asking about that?

549
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,500
They say you aren't concerned about A'Yuan

550
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,200
must be because your stepmother used to treat you poorly.

551
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
She must've hit you.

552
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,400
When has Aunty ever hit me?

553
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,900
Only you hit me.

554
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,700
When did I hit you?

555
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,800
Fine, you didn't.

556
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,200
You were wielding the stick of love.

557
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,000
What did you say to them?

558
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,800
I told them A'Yao knows what he's doing.

559
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,700
We didn't lose A'Yuan.

560
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,200
They just didn't believe me.

561
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,900
Who cares about them?

562
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,900
A'Yao, tell me the truth.

563
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,500
I won't tell anyone, all right?

564
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Let me answer the phone.

565
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,700
Hello, Xia Xia.

566
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,000
What's up?

567
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Okay.

568
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
I'll come from home. Wait for me there.

Xu Hongdou!

571
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,300
- What are you doing?
- There are two bird nests over here.

572
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Want me to get them down for you?

573
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Aren't you going for a jog today?

574
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
I just want to rest.

575
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Want to check out the town?

576
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I won't visit manmade attractions.

577
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,400
Fine.

578
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,900
Granny, I'm going to the Old Town later.

579
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,500
I'll get Xu Hongdou to help you set up your stall.

580
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,700
No need. I can do it myself.

581
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
No way. What are you thinking?

582
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
By the way, do me a favor later.

583
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,400
What favor is it this time?

584
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,200
Tell her about my homecoming to start a business.

585
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,500
Are you planning to keep another one here?

586
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,300
No, I just want her to do me a favor.

587
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,800
Well, should I make it sound miserable or impressive?

588
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,400
Make is sound like a tough journey.

589
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
All right. You can eat. I'll get going.

593
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
There's no smell of baked bread.

594
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Why can't I smell it?

Nope.

Yeah, someone I like is fine.
