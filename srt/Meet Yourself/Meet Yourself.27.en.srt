Please bless her with success in work and peace in life.

Do we throw or keep them?

Take a look for yourself.

129
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,110
You still have magazines from 20 years ago. Why are you keeping them?

130
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,992
As a keepsake.

131
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,930
I think you can live with Grandma Liu from the next building.

132
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,734
She keeps everything.

133
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,690
She brings junk home every day.

134
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,930
She never listens to her son or daughter-in-law.

135
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,682
Her home has so much junk that there's no space to walk.

136
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,874
Your mom just loves to exaggerate.

137
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:38,850
I don't think there's much stuff. Just one cabinet. It's not too much.

138
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,290
Weren't you the one who said this the other day?

139
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,958
“Should we dump Dou's cabinet of junk?"

140
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,740
Now, you're playing the good guy.

141
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,280
When have I called that junk? I said they were old items.

142
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,610
Junk. Items. You didn't hear clearly.

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,670
Fine, I'll record your speech next time.

144
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,630
I didn't say that anyway.

145
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,260
This is selective memory loss.

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,000
Isn't it obvious that I wanted to buy him a gift and celebrate together?

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,120
At five o'clock today, I went to pick up the cake.

162
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,012
I even got my hair styled for him.

163
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:48,150
I called him to see if he had gotten off work.

164
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,630
He told me he didn't have work today.

165
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,778
He asked for leave and went home.

166
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:56,482
He went home?

167
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,830
I asked him why he had gone home.

168
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,360
He said he took time off to go home for his birthday.

169
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,750
He said it was okay.

170
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,350
I can give him the birthday gift tomorrow.

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,650
I'm so pissed off. I want to break up with him!

172
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,944
You don't have to be so extreme, Xiao Qin.

173
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:15,790
That kid might not have dated anyone before.

174
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,410
So, he's a simple guy. He doesn't know about such things.

175
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,360
How can he be clueless? Doesn't he want to be with me every day?

176
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,750
Won't you get bored if you're together every day?

177
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,950
He'll get bored of me?

178
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,960
How can he get bored of me?

179
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,140
I wasn't talking about him.

180
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I mean... you guys shouldn't be joined at the hip.

181
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,580
People get tired no matter how beautiful you are.

182
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,948
When you're in love, you need to give your partner space.

183
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,300
Space?

184
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,320
Why does love need space?

185
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,270
Haven't I given him enough space?

186
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,270
I didn't even ask him to call me during work.

187
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,310
He just needs to send me his location every 30 minutes.

188
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,460
Xiao Qin, I don't mean to lecture you.

189
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,080
Yang Guanjun, watch your mouth.

190
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,240
In terms of seniority, I‘m your sister-in-law.

191
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,910
Jiabao and Guobao call you their sister.

192
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,320
Am I supposed to call you sister-in-law?

193
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,630
If you agree with me, I'll call you Brother Guanjun.

194
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,594
If you disagree with me, I'll drag out our seniority gap.

195
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,670
I'm not opposing your views.

196
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,178
I'm just offering advice as someone who's been there.

197
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:25,600
If you guys hang out all the time, you'll get sick of each other quickly. Got it?

198
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,110
He'll get sick of me?

199
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,358
How can he?

200
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,570
My goodness! Uncle A'Yao, did you hear him?

201
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,601
- Yes, I did.
- How can he get sick of me? What's wrong with him?

202
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,386
That's outrageous!

203
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:39,612
Yang Zhinan is preposterous!

204
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:40,790
What space does he even need?

205
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,850
What space does love need?

206
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,380
Shouldn't you spend every second with your partner? Right?

207
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,670
Xiao Qin looks so gorgeous today.

208
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,490
She even bought a cake, but Yang Zhinan went home!

209
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,790
If a guy has a girlfriend, isn't he supposed to spend his birthday with her?

210
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,370
Do you know what this means?

211
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,950
What does this mean?

212
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,310
It means that he doesn't care much about you.

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,944
Yang Zhinan is a jerk!

214
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:09,550
I want to break up with him!

215
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,960
Break up! Right now! Call him! Tell him you want to break up.

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,070
- Outrageous!
- Xiao Qin, don't call him.

217
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,480
Yang Guanjun, you stay right there.

218
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,080
You're not going to change my mind.

219
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,420
Yang Zhinan, I gave you space. Let's break up!

220
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,448
I no longer have a boyfriend.

221
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,700
Xiao Qin, listen to my advice.

222
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,878
Let's not shed tears for love.

223
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,350
We have to focus on our careers. Got it?

224
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,204
I don't even have a career.

225
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,020
Xie Zhiyao, why did you fan the flames?

226
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,440
In the blink of an eye, Xiao Qin is single again.

227
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,550
Since you refuse to support her today,

228
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,150
I'll hold this against you.

229
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,768
You're just jealous that she's dating someone while you're single. Right?

230
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,790
Yang Guanjun, don't you dare speak to Uncle A'Yao like that.

231
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,920
Uncle A'Yao is my only ally in this world.

232
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,430
Yes. I'll always support you.

233
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,540
Uncle A'Yao, why don't you marry me?

234
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,770
Fabulous, you dug your own grave.

235
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,270
What's wrong? Is it the fishbone?

236
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,400
Karma is real.

237
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
Uncle A'Yao.

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,050
Are you really choking?

239
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,371
Don't eat the cake! Go to the hospital! Let's go.

240
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,240
Uncle A'Yao, don't cough. You're scaring me.

241
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,270
Don't swallow your saliva. Hang in there.

242
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,840
Fortunately, it's not very deep. It's just stuck in your tonsils.

243
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,662
Your tonsils look gorgeous.

244
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,606
Very good.

245
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,384
It's out.

246
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,960
It's been a long time since I saw someone swallow such a huge fishbone.

247
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,060
How did that happen?

248
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,170
I didn't notice it.

249
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,780
Tons of people need emergency care daily because of fishbones.

250
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,490
You must be careful while eating fish.

251
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,190
You're pretty smart and came to the hospital.

252
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,370
Many people drink vinegar and swallow rice, driving the fishbone deeper.

253
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,950
It'll be dangerous if your esophagus gets cut.

254
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,130
Just a moment. Let me take a picture.

255
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,550
Didn't your girlfriend come with you?

256
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,590
You accompanied that pretty lady for her IV drip, right?

257
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,060
Thank goodness you're fine.

258
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,340
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Let's go.

259
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,900
Xiao Qin, I choked on a fishbone once as a child.

260
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,640
It was bigger than this one.

261
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,750
This big.

262
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,110
That big?

263
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,030
At that time, I was scared to death.

264
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,070
You must be careful when eating fish.

265
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,690
You even let him eat the cake.

266
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,640
The doctor already said to avoid food.

267
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,980
I didn't know he couldn't even eat cake.

268
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,400

Eat properly, or you won't have energy.

293

People need energy even to feel sad.

Why do you think I'm sad? Goodness, Granny.

I'll eat it later.

296
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,380
Granny, she doesn't send me messages.

297
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,020
I can't really take the initiative either.

298
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,040
Why can't you send her a message first?

299
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,490
Is the signal bad with your phone?

300
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,790
I'm being serious here.

301
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,581
Here's the thing. I'm not in the position to initiate anything.

302
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:53,250
Before she left, I already told her.

303
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,030
What did you say?

304
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,880
I told her... I liked her.

305
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,490
I'll stop talking if that's your reaction.

306
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,894
Keep going. You like her, and?

307
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:20,760
Nothing else. I confessed my feelings and that's it.

308
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,980
Well, did she ask to sever all contact?

309
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,740
Of course not. She just said to keep in touch.

310
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,960
We're still friends and all that.

311
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,410
Isn't that telling?

312
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,819
You've spoken your mind, and now you're shy.

313
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,840
Be bolder. Take the initiative.

314
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,986
An online relationship might just unfold.

315
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:49,110
Granny, she doesn't want an online relationship or a long-distance one.

316
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,100
In that case, put in some effort.

317
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,410
Fly from Yunnan to Beijing, and then from Beijing to Yunnan.

318
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,650
I have money. I saved money for you.

319
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,390
You saved money for me? How much have you saved?

320
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,350
Wait a minute.

321
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,660
Look.

322
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,350
What...

323
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,052
I was going to give you this money

324
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:39,900
if your business didn't work out here.

325
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,020
You can go back to Beijing.

326
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,546
If you get married, these will be the funds for your family.

327
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:51,210
Of course, it isn't enough to buy a house or land.

328
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,134
But it's enough as emergency funds.

329
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,880
I think Hongdou's departure was good for both of you.

330
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,332
Youngsters like you guys fall in and out of love quickly.

331
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:10,650
Once she left, you had time to cool your head.

332
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,060
If you still miss each other,

333
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,508
then start considering how to move forward.

334
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:21,386
Don't be in a hurry.

335
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,954
Your grandpa and I started with nothing.

336
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:32,930
We spent a lifetime understanding a truth.

337
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,610
That is to fight for what you desire.

338
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,510
Don't wait for someone else's offerings.

339
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,440
Cheer up. Don't be so downcast.

340
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,210
Got it?

341
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,900
If you do, then eat up.

342
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,406
Granny, isn't the bankbook for me?

343
00:24:56,406 --> 00:24:59,630
You can have it when you buy a ticket.

344
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,354
But I'm still curious.

345
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:05,170
How did you save up so much money?

346
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,059
I just called your dad all the time

347
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,650
complaining about my headaches or sore butt.

348
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,460
I asked him for money and saved it for you.

349
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,990
Let me answer this call. It's from Xiao Huang.

350
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,110
Xiao Huang, what is it?

351
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,200
<i>Hello, Old Xie?</i>

352
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,780
<i>Shaohua Bookstore's team will arrive in five days.</i>

353
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,940
- It's been confirmed?
<i>- Yes, it's confirmed. Come over for a meeting.</i>

354
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay, I'll be right over.

355
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,280
Granny, I have to attend a meeting at the village committee.

356
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,340
You're missing another meal.

357
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
- Take this with you and eat it on the way.
- Okay.

358
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,680
Can I have that one?

359
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,180
Thank you, Granny.

360
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,850
I'm off.

361
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,650
When I was in Yunmiao Village,

362
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,830
I got up before dawn and went to the town

363
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,960
to eat small pot rice noodles at the market.

364
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,380
Can a sloth like you wake up early?

365
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,860
I had someone to wake me up.

366
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,780
Xie Zhiyao's home is an alley away from the courtyard I lived in.

367
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,100
I can see their yard from my window.

368
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,300
He's an early riser.

369
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,590
So, he'll hurl pebbles at my window.

370
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,801
You know what? Only locals would know about such a shop.

371
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,830
Is that the young man

372
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,920
who went home to start a business?

373
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,140
That's him. He's very nice.

374
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,308
How old is he?

375
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,300
In his early 30s.

376
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,900
He seems like quite a good catch.

377
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,940
Why is he still single?

378
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,780
He hasn't met the right girl.

379
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,620
He said his last relationship was when he was still in college.

380
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,230
That's over a decade ago.

381
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,612
Is he single because he has issues with...

382
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,566
Mom!

383
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
What's embarrassing about that?

384
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,680
He just hasn't met the right person.

385
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,748
No one would think about physical deficiencies.

386
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:11,490
Everyone is bound to think this way. What else could it be?

387
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,690
He set the bar too high.

388
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,060
Your daughter doesn't have a boyfriend either.

389
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,300
Is there something wrong with me, too?

390
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,010
There's definitely no problem with you.

391
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,100
It's normal for girls to marry late these days.

392
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,830
Mom, you have double standards.

393
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,290
Of course. I'd definitely praise my own child.

394
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,060
You're just too far away from each other.

395
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,670
Eat up. I'll take you out after breakfast.

396
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,410
I'm not going fishing with Dad.

397
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,930
No one mentioned fishing.

398
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,110
Let's go pick peaches, okay?

399
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,140
Okay, peach picking.

400
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,840
Eat up.

401
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,070
The peaches Hongdou picked are excellent.

402
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,570
Each of them is at least half a catty, right?

403
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,042
It's so sweet.

404
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,080
What did she say?

405
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,130
Hope to hear good news from you.
<i>[The peaches are very sweet. I wanted to let you guys try them.]</i>

406
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,770
[Has the wind risen over there? Hope to hear good news from you.- Xu Hongdou.]
- What good news?

407
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,950
She's talking about the bookstore.

408
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,720
Granny, look here.

409
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,550
This one is particularly great.

410
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,590
Let me have a look.

411
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,530
You took such an ugly picture of me! So ugly!

412
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,910
You're cute. You don't get it.

413
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,110
What? Cute?

414
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,810
I already sent it. I sent it over.

415
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,530
I'll beat you to a pulp.

416
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,230
Stop. I'll take a box to Granny Huailan.

417
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,031
Ouch!

418
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,566
I'm off!

419
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,300
Here, have some peaches.

420
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,270
It's sweet. Really sweet.

421
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,210
She sent over 200 catties over.

422
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,790
How much does the express delivery cost?

423
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,580
What a pity.

424
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,730
She's a good lady, but she just can't get used to living here.

425
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,300
Did you see A'Yao the other day?

426
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,950
He was fuming, and then he fell silent.

427
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,450
He's like a deflated balloon, utterly listless.

428
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,240
Didn't he drop by this morning?

429
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,540
He seemed pretty cheery.

430
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,780
He was in good spirits and smiling from ear to ear.

431
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,100
Men and women are different.

432
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,860
If a man breaks up, he won't be heartbroken for more than a week.

433
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,720
Even Chairman Xie is no exception.

434
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,634
I'm disappointed in all men.

435
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:24,990
You've hit the nail on the head. Men forget easily.

436
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,300
Look at Baoping.

437
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,900
She didn't remarry even though it's been years since her husband passed away.

438
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,841
- Exactly.
- What about the old crow in the village?

439
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:34,780
Less than 100 days had passed since his wife's death,

440
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,310
but he already went to a matchmaker for a new wife.

441
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,250
Shameless!

442
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,010
That old man is shameless.

443
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,710
Shameless.

444
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,250
Chuchu and Xiaoyue, don't despair.

445
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,060
There are still good men around,

446
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,772
like Guanjun.

447
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,982
Guanjun is really a good lad.

448
00:29:52,982 --> 00:29:54,900
Don't blow your own horn like A'Gui.

449
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,300
You'll regret when problems arise.

450
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,800
You're right.

451
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,650
Is it sweet?

452
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,650
It is.

453
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,570
Open your mouth.

454
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,550
Is it sweet?

455
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah.

456
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,170
Don't stare at me.

457
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,338
Try one.

458
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,640
It's sweet.

459
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,650
Sister, why did you ask Na Na for those wine bottles, cans, and jars?

460
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,920
I want to do magic.

461
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,950
Don't leave me hanging.

462
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,730
Don't throw away the peach pits when you're done eating.

463
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,430
Keep them for me.

464
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,450
What do you need them for?

465
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,110
These contain life. Got it?

466
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,000
Come here.

467
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,140
Your hair is too long.

468
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,000
I'll cut it for you.

469
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,450
You can cut hair?

470
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,611
Of course. I cut my daughter's hair.

471
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,930
That's great.

472
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,301
You know what? The barbershop here is too expensive.

473
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,340
It costs several dozen yuan for a haircut.

474
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,690
In return, you have to sing a song for me.

475
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,950
Deal. What song do you want to hear?

476
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,060
"Wind."

477
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,080
♪ Blow on. Blowing on our faces... ♪

478
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,236

Jiahui!

Hello. This is our special sugared peach.

Please have a taste.

Hello.

486
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,460
This is our special sugared peach. Please try it.

Please enjoy.

489
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,780
You guys look so stiff. It looks too intentional. Come on, look at each other.

490
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,950
Looking at each other. You have to smile gently,

491
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,300
like this peach is delicious.

492
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,200
Okay, that's it. Three, two, one.

493
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,450
Nice. Off you go.

496
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,618
So be it.

497
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:33,658
I'm worried that he'll dash to Beijing just for Xu Hongdou.

498
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,000
I've lost my appetite.

507
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,700
Tiger-head shoes?

508
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,110
These were made by a granny in Yunnan.

509
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,300
She refused to accept payment.

510
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,420
She put her heart into every stitch.

511
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,910
If Grandma was still alive,

512
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,210
she would've made tiger-head shoes for my baby, too.

513
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,950
Granny smells just like our grandma. Smell it.

514
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,170
It's true.

515
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,010
It's the smell of boiled peanuts.

516
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,144
Not the smell of baking bread?

517
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,518
It's boiled peanuts.

518
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,530
Wipe your tears quickly.

519
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,489
If Mom comes by, she'll think I did something to you.

520
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,410
I'm fine. I'm just pregnant.

521
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,094
So, I'm unusually emotional.

522
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,730
Kexin, how is your husband treating you?

523
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,344
Not bad.

524
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,090
We're both quite lazy.

525
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,780
His mother spoiled him until he knows nothing.

526
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,820
My mom spoiled me until I know nothing.

527
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,000
We're two grown babies. We can't frown upon each other.

528
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,422
Fortune favors fools.

529
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:19,050
Second Sister, I picked up a piece of trash.

530
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,250
You have to be careful and find a good partner.

531
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,330
How good does he have to be?

532
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,740
Firstly, he has to be handsome.

533
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,930
He needs to earn good money.

534
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,060
What else? He must have a nice family.

535
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,110
His parents have to be reasonable.

536
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,740
He has to be able to afford a house in Beijing.

537
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,860
At the very least, he should hold a Beijing household registration.

538
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,340
What if he's not from Beijing?

539
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,700
Shanghai is fine, too.

540
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,050
What about Yunnan?

541
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,550
Yunnan?

542
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,658
Yunnan is...

543
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,050
Did you fall in love with someone from Yunnan?

544
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,410
Was it a one-night stand in Yunnan?

545
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,460
What are you blabbering? Don't let your mom and my mom hear you.

546
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,800
Who did you fall for?

547
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,010
You know what?

548
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,171
If you weren't pregnant, I would've walloped you. What's this nonsense?

549
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,920
Baby, Mom is so scared.

550
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,340
Why is your aunty getting mad?

551
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,200
You're the most annoying.

552
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,250
Back to serious matters. Have you found a new job yet?

553
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,756
A new job?

554
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:23,270
Aunty said you were sick of working at the same hotel in Beijing

555
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,024
for over a decade and want a new job.

556
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,350
How's it going?

557
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,670
Slow down.

558
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,370
Mom.

559
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,970
Is there anything I can help you with?

560
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,666
Just wait for food to be served.

561
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,320
Mom.

562
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,660
Mom... Mom... What are you doing?

563
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,850
Speak your mind.

564
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,802
How did you know I resigned?

565
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,450
Aunty Sun and Xiao Gang wanted to travel to Beijing,

566
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,280
so she called your hotel in hopes of a discount by mentioning your name.

567
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,256
They told her that Manager Xu resigned.

568
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,430
Xu Hongdou, you should know that secrets can't be kept.

569
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,230
Your whole life, every lie you said was exposed.

570
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,320
Since you know about my resignation, why didn't you ask me about it?

571
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,220
You seemed like you were having a good time.

572
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,881
Why should I pry? We can discuss it once you're home.

573
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:40,940
You didn't ask when I got back.

574
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,640
Well, you can tell me now.

575
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,200
It's nothing really.

576
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,090
As a child, you said that slower chicks need to start flapping their wings first.

577
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,600
I can't fly anymore. I'm tired.

578
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,742
I just want to take a break.

579
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:55,484
It's fine if you don't want to flap your wings.

580
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:58,030
It's nice to return to the nest and rest.

581
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:03,410
Our family can rely on Xu Hongmi, the little cash catcher, to roll in the cash for us.

582
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:08,040
Just like the swallows under the eaves of your grandma's house.

583
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,840
Mom, I'm not joking.

584
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,030
Okay. Let's talk seriously. What's your plan?

585
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,268
Your dad and your sister want you to go to Shanghai.

586
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,616
Actually, I have a friend in HR who reached out to me.

587
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,780
Their hotel is recruiting for staff training.

588
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,410
The job is quite suitable for me.

589
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,734
It's a job with normal working hours.

590
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:37,380
There's no need to be on 24-hour standby.

591
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,316
That's good. It's fine as long as you like it.

592
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:42,820
You don't have to worry about me and your dad.

593
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,110
We have some savings.

594
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,450
We don't spend much either.

595
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,410
Besides, there's your sister.

596
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,930
As long as you can feed yourself, we'll be free of worries.

597
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,998
Don't be so stressed.

598
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:56,630
I don't want to be much worse than my sister.

599
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,988
Why do you always compare yourself with her?

600
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,560
I'm not.

601
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,760
You guys were the ones comparing us ever since childhood.

602
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,510
That's my fault. I shouldn't have done that.

603
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,150
We're in the wrong. I'll apologize to you. I'm sorry.

604
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,110
Mom, you're so quick with admitting you're wrong.

605
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,510
That's too much of a preemptive strike.

606
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,910
I don't even know what to say.

607
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,760
In that case, don't say anything.

608
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,590
Wait for the food to be ready.

609
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,800
Aren't you going to add water to the dumplings?

610
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,772
Leave it to me, all right? Just wait for food to be served.

611
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,864
These guys are horrible.

612
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,730
How nice.

613
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,590
All done. It's my turn now.

614
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,170
Okay.

615
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,262
I'll give you a massage.

616
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,220
How is it?

617
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,620
Wow, such strength.

618
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,080
<i>[Xie Zhiyao: How many peaches did you pick? You even made sure everyone has a share. Thank you. Virtual massage for you.]</i>

619
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,320
<i>[You must be having a lot of fun back home. You don't even reply to messages.]</i>

620
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,440
What's wrong?

621
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,930
Who is it?

622
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,274
Hongdou is calling me.

623
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:32,124
Answer it.

624
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,404
Stupid boy.

625
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,310
Hello? Can you hear me?

626
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,860
Hello, are you busy? Why did you take so long to answer the call?

627
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,630
I was with Granny just now. I came upstairs first.

628
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,012
<i>What are you doing?</i>

629
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,200
I am packing up my books. I'm moving to a new house soon.

630
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,230
I didn't have time to reply this afternoon.

631
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,400
My aunty brought my cousin over. It was really bustling.

632
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,300
Everyone was making dumplings.

633
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,200
<i>My cousin is several months pregnant. I was accompanying her.</i>

634
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,960
No wonder. I wouldn't have been able to pick up your call this afternoon anyway.

635
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,290
I was having a meeting about the bookstore in the village.

636
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,260
Any progress?

637
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,870
<i>The team will make a formal visit in a few days.</i>

638
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,310
We were discussing their reception. I'm working with the village.

639
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,840
There's still the homestay.

640
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,300
Some guys will come over to survey the place soon.

641
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,756
It's hard to sell the place?

642
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:54,860
<i>Yeah, it's hard. The potential buyer is offering a very low price.</i>

643
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,820
He just wants a steal. The previous owner is in want of money.

644
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,060
The price has been dropping drastically.

645
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,280
I see.

646
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,230
<i>Let's not talk about that.</i>

647
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,330
They're just troubles weighing on my mind.

648
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,075
<i>- The noodles your mom made...</i>
- How's your throat?

649
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,460
Why didn't you give me a like after you saw it?

650
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,052
When I saw the post, eleven hours had already passed.

651
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:35,510
Besides, is it really appropriate to give a like for that?

652
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,600
It doesn't matter to me.

653
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,411
You didn't give me a like either.

654
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,970
When I saw that, over ten hours had passed too.

655
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,820
When you posted it, I was in the hospital.

656
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,120
Fine.

657
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,540
Well... Are we good?

658
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,180
Yeah.

659
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,510
Let's... keep in touch?

660

♫ <i>In the street where rain and sunshine shower down</i> ♫

661
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,111
Why are you laughing?

662
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:09,130
Can't I laugh when I am happy?

663
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,390
Aren't you happy to be home?

664
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,360
♫ <i>We say goodbye</i> ♫

665
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,220
I have to hang up. Have a good rest. Good night.

666
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,380
Sure. We'll leave it at that. Good night.

667

00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,330
Your mom is eavesdropping.

672
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,740
