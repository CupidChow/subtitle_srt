00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,400
<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
Your village is ridiculous.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
A groundless rumor has spread like its the truth.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The next rumor would be our child turning a year old.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,700
That's how it is in the countryside.

7
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000
Once they're done talking about you, they'll start on the next person.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Everyone thinks rumors are true.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,300
In the end, these rumors are exaggerated beyond belief.

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
The kids even went to the courtyard to look at you.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
It was a great chance to refute.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,100
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,300
What can I say?

14
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,800
They'll know who I am once I start clearing the air.

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,000
What's with your warped logic?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You were so eager to wallop A'Yuan and me

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,200
out of anger when we wronged you.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
You're exaggerating.

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Now that you have a chance to clear your name, you don't do a thing.

20
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,400
What's there for me to say?

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll be leaving soon.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,700
We're here!

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,000
- Over here!
- I dragged Damai over.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
Have a seat.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Brother Guanjun, two colas.

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
- Okay.
- The food isn't ready yet.

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
What were you talking about.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
We were discussing how I'll be left behind with this mess

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,100
after Xu Hongdou leaves.

30
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,000
You'll be fine.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just do what you need to.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Hongdou, are you leaving?

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Not now.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, why did Chairman Xie say he'll be left behind?

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't you know about Xie Zhiyao and me?

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
What happened to you two?

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Xu Hongdou.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
You sound like you're spreading rumors about yourself.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
What rumors?

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
The rumor in the village is that

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,000
Hongdou is Chairman Xie's ex-girlfriend from Beijing.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
She has come looking for him, and they've reconciled.

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,400
That's not all. They'll be getting married soon.

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Well, are you two getting married?

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
What do you think?

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
I think there's a chance.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Both of you fit the bill for marriage.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,300
What bill?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,900
Both of you are single.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,900
I didn't realize it until you mentioned it.

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,400
That's a hard fact.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,700
It's true!

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,500
There's a romantic trope of marriage before love.

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
It's popular among readers.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The stories are very sweet.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Stop sighing.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Things will get better once I leave.

58
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,200
Persevere.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
How can you leave?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Once you leave, there'll be new rumors

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,800
about Chairman Xie's girlfriend dumping him again

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,400
because she can't stand the countryside.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
That makes sense.

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Hey, Xu Hongdou. You're horrible!

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
How am I supposed to find a girlfriend in the future?

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
If a woman despises you because you've been dumped before,

67
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
then she doesn't deserve your love.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That makes sense.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Here you go.

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,600
This is extra spicy.

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,500
This one has regular spiciness.

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,500
These aren't spicy.

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Thanks, boss.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,100
If you marry A'Yao,

76
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,000
you'll be able to eat here for free.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
That's such a great deal!

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,100
Why are you giving her free meals, when I don't get them?

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,800
What has that got to do with you?

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Mind your own business.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
- I won't go to the cafe tomorrow.
- Why not?

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,700
- I'm hanging out with others.
- With who?

83
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
These two.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,500
Tomorrow is my day off, too.

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,600
Damai always stays in her room. No one can ever lure her out.

86
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
She's finally inviting us out.

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,700
We have to grant her wish.

88
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay, have fun.

This color isn't bright enough.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's too simple.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,300
Well, let's emboss it in silver.

106
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,400
The quality will be better.

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
What about hollowing it out?

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,700
Let's hollow out the packaging sash.

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,900
We'll keep the box simple.

110
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll make a sample and show you.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Okay.

112
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Hello, Brother?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
What is it?

114
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
Okay, calm down. I'll be right there.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What's wrong?

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's nothing. You guys carry on.

Wait! Listen to me!

119
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Calm down! You'll be paid eventually.

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,600
Won't we be wasting our efforts if we demolish this homestay?

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
The project was suddenly shut down,

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
and two months of our wages have been delayed.

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
Our boss has gone missing.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are we supposed to do?

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your boss called me. He's raising funds.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Fine, ask him to pay us.

127
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
- Right?
- Yes.

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
- Pay us!
- We need to keep ourselves fed!

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Isn't the village committee going to intervene?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,300
You've gone to the village committee, so you should understand.

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
The secretary and the director are out for a meeting today.

132
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,500
We aren't neglecting you.

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Enough with the excuses! Pay up!

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Everyone should pay their debts!

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,300
<i>Pay up!</i>

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Here! Over here!

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Thanks!

138
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,800
<i>Pay up!</i>

139
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Enough with your crap!

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Old Xie! Old Xie!

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,300
Everyone, be quiet.

142
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,000
A'Yao is here. Let's hear what he has to say.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
Why have you surrounded Xiao Huang?

144
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Don't yell at a girl.

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's settle the problem first.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,300
Have a smoke, Brother.

147
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,200
Come on, take a cigarette.

148
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Brother, I dropped everything at hand and rushed over to your call.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's focus on solving the problem.

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,500
Don't be angry, all right?

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
A'Yao, the boss has fled,

152
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,800
but he didn't pay our wages.

153
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Yes, I promise to resolve the issue with your wages.

154
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,100
The boss has invested millions in this homestay.

155
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
The stuff here is worth hundreds of thousands.

156
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,500
A monk may run, but the temple remains. He has to return, right?

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Yeah, compare the price of all these to your wages.

158
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,000
He wouldn't ditch everything here and flee.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Well, pay our wages!

160
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes, pay us!

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Pay up! Give us the money!

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Enough. Hold on.

163
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,500
- A'Yao, you recruited us for this homestay.
- Yes.

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Huang Xinxin is the guarantor.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,800
You can't stay out of this.

166
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,700
In fact, we would've quit once wages weren't paid for a month.

167
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
But the boss treated us pretty well.

168
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,700
We can understand his difficulties.

169
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,400
So, we kept working even thought our wages were delayed.

170
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,700
He may be raising funds now,

171
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,200
but how long more do we have to wait?

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,300
Should we take on other jobs or not?

173
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,200
Do we have to keep on waiting?

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,300
No one is giving us answers.

175
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes, you're right.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,400
The homestay near the airport offered a higher price than this.

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
You said this place was nearer to our home,

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,800
and we can go home if we chose this project.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,500
This also benefits our village's future development.

180
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
We agreed with you,

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
but the boss has gone missing.

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
We don't even get paid.

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,700
What should we do?

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
Brother, don't worry.

185
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,400
Xiao Huang and I will find a solution right away.

186
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll look for you tonight and resolve this, all right?

187
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,600
I understand your frustration and worries.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
You've done nothing wrong either,

189
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
but we can't solve any problems by standing here. Okay?

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
We'll find a solution right away and get you paid.

191
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Are you okay with this?

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
Brother A'Yao is a bigwig,

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
so he's great at speaking up for bosses.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
He's trying to coax us and stop us from causing trouble!

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
Everyone's just trying to work for a living.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Why do you make it sound like we're troublemakers, A'Quan?

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,900
Even television shows about the government, journalists,

198
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,300
or lawyers helping with wage issues take time.

199
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,400
Well, pay us! Darned brat!

200
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,200
Uncle!

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Does A'Yao or the committee owe you money? Stupid boy!

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,700
Uncle, don't kick him.

203
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,300
He's frustrated because he's not getting paid for his work.

204
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,400
It's understandable.

205
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah. I'd be angry if I were in his shoes.

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't stand around. You can go.

207
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
Why are you lingering here? It's such a hot day.

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Your wages for today will be paid, too. All right?

209
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,500
Wait for news from us. Okay? All right?

210
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,600
Let's go home.

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Guys, move it.

212
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Wait for news at home.

213
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Off you go! Move it!

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Have a cigarette.

215
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Come on. Get moving.

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Wait for news at home.

217
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200
Brother, have a smoke.

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,100
A'Yao, I trust you.

219
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
Take it easy!

220
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,400
My luck sure is amazing.

221
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,600
The secretary and village director just happen to be out.

222
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
I called the director, and he told me to take a look.

223
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,400
Once I arrived, they refused to listen to me.

224
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
I'm just one person.

225
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,500
How can I win in an argument against 20 others?

226
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,100
My throat, tongue, and lips are parched.

227
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
What's up with the homestay's owner?

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Did he really go bankrupt?

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
I called him.

230
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
He said he's raising funds.

231
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,600
He spent so much money on this place.

232
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Even if he really went bankrupt,

233
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,400
shouldn't he hurry back and sell this place?

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
This place isn't easy to sell.

235
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,400
If Shaohua Bookstore has a store here, it would be an easy deal.

236
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,600
When is your senior who's a photographer coming over?

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,700
She said she'll come over once she's done with her short film.

238
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,900
Okay.

239
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Where's your Xu Hongdou?

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Having fun somewhere.

241
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Hey, she isn't mine.

242
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Don't you know that you're getting married?

243
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,200
I don't know.

244
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,700
Xiao Qin.

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
What's wrong?

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Did your dad scold you again?

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,500
<i>WeChat scan.</i>

248
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,000
Brother A'Yao,

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
you told me on WeChat that your marriage is a rumor.

250
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
Is that true?

251
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,200
Yes, it is.

252
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,300
Call me Uncle A'Yao.

253
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,300
Well, can you marry me?

254
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Of course not.

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Why not?

256
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You're disdainful of me for my lack of education and skills, right?

257
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Xiao Qin,

258
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
when I was in junior high, you were a little girl.

259
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
I even carried you when you were a baby.

260
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,200
When I started working, I sent you gift money every year when I came back.

261
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
Do you remember this?

262
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Some men like younger girls.

263
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,200
Some celebrities are 12 years older than their wives.

264
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Isn't that right, Xinxin?

265
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Yes, that's right.

266
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah.

267
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
However, Uncle A'Yao likes girls his age.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
They have common topics to talk about.

269
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
What common topics?

270
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
After spending time together, we'll have tons of things in common.

271
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Common topics don't form just by spending time together.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,700
It's something more spiritual.

273
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,100
I don't get it.

274
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,300
Brother A'Yao, I'll give you one last chance.

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,600
If I learn embroidery, will you give me a chance?

276
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,100
Nope.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Fine, I won't give you a chance either.

278
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I have suitors.

279
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,000
By the way, my name is Candy!

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,500
Bye-bye, Candy.

281
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Candy?

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I asked Daxia to send a list of all the construction sites around the village.

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
We can ask each of them.

284
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay, let's go.

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,500
♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫

286
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,930
♫ <i>Enjoy the mountainous landscape at sunset</i> ♫

287
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,200
♫ <i>The raindrops from the roof drip into my eyes quietly</i> ♫

288
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,500
♫ <i>The world is like a quiet island</i> ♫

289
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,200
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,
and the starry sky</i> ♫

290
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,300
♫ <i>Disoriented footsteps will gradually be erased</i> ♫

291
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

292
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,900
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

293
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,000
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

294
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
Old Hu!

295
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,800
I'm here! Over here!

296
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,200
Come on in! Welcome!

297
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,500
- Hello.
- This way, please.

298
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Over here. Let me do the introductions.

299
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,200
These are the three beauties of our courtyard.

300
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,700
Na Na, Hongdou, and Little Sister Damai.

301
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,600
Hello.

302
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
This is my friend, Xiao Ma Que.

303
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,400
She and her husband are the owners of this bar.

304
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
This is our gathering spot for parties.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It feels great to enjoy drinks and brag a little here.

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,100
Enjoy yourselves. I'll make you something back there.

307
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,200
Thank you.

308
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,700
Thanks a lot.

309
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
What would you like to drink?

310
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Here are your cocktails.

311
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Enjoy.

312
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,700
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
Come on.

314
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Cheers.

Hurry up.

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,700
Make a wish!

336
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,100
Oh, right.

337
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Happy birthday!

338
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,600
I didn't blow out the candle.

339
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
Let's blow it out together.

340
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
One, two, three!

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
I saw your identity card before.

342
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
We wanted to throw a birthday party for you,

343
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
but your unexpected invitation came first.

344
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,600
You didn't even say a word either.

345
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,200
So, Hongdou and I decided to feign ignorance and play along.

346
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Then, we'd give you a surprise.

347
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,800
- I'm pretty surprised.
- Little Sister Damai, happy birthday!

348
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

349
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Not at all. It's my honor.

350
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,400
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

351
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
There's no need to thank me.

352
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,300
We live in the same courtyard. We're family. There's no need for such pleasantries.

353
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,600
I raise this toast to you, Mr. Hu!

354
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
I'll finish this.

355
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,789
H-Hold on.

356
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,900
I'll finish this too.

357
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,700
I'll get the workers to come over tomorrow. Thank you.

358
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,520
Sure. Several workers applied for leave to participate in a singing party,

359
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,700
so we're short on manpower.

360
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,600
Just to be sure, are the wages paid daily?

361
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Rest assured, they're paid daily.

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
- Okay.
- Great.

363
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,000
You don't have to see us off. You can get on with your work.

364
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,100
Okay. Take care! Goodbye!

365
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,200
Thank you! Bye-bye!

366
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
All right, I'll treat you to lunch.

367
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm good.

368
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,100
I'll send you back first.

369
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,200
The three girls from our courtyard went drinking, so I have to pick them up.

370
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,500
Okay.

371
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,200

<i>No, but will we eat fruits and have fun together like this?</i>

<i>Of course.</i>

396
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,300

<i>You're not allowed to say that!</i>

This is mine.

421
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
- Yours?
- Yeah, it's mine.

422
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
I was sitting there.

423
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,400
I think both of you can form a duo.

424
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Call yourselves Spicy Soup!

425
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,900
Spicy Soup?

426
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,800
In my hometown, we pronounce "Na Na" as "La La".
<i>("La" means spicy)</i>

427
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,000
We can't differentiate "ne" and "le".

428
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,220
Spicy Soup is one name,

429
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,600
but you can also be called Hula Hoop!

430
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
Little Sister Damai, are you drunk?

431
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,700
Stop drinking.

432
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm not.

433
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
Mr. Hu.

434
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,500
What?

435
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,600
I used to think you were really boisterous,

436
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,000
but I'm really sorry for that. I'll down this drink.

437
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
Don't, Little Sister.

438
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Don't drink it! I'll drink!

439
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
She's down so quickly?

440
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,000
She said I'm boisterous seconds ago, and she's out?

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
She drank too much.

442
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Damai.

443
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Chairman Xie.

444
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,200
Where? The parking lot?

445
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Okay.

446
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Bye.

447
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
- Damai, we're leaving.
- Hello.

448
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,900
Hello. Are you Singing Nana-chan?

449
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm not, you got the wrong person.

450
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,800
Sorry.

451
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
It's fine.

452
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,100
What's wrong? Is she drunk?

453
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,300
Yeah, she drank too much.

454
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
- Chairman Xie is at the parking lot. Let's go.
- Get going.

455
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
- I'll pay the bill.
- I've already paid.

456
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,900
- That won't do.
- Why not?

457
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,200
- Off you go.
- Okay.

458
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,400
What about Damai?

459
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
- Come on.
- I'm not drunk.

460
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
- You're not?
- Okay, fine.

461
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
- It's good if you aren't drunk.
- You aren't drunk. Let's go.

462
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
Xie Zhiyao is here to pick us up. Let's go.

463
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Why is he picking us up?

464
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,800
We can't drive after drinking.

465
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,700
- Take care of her.
- Be careful.

466
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll follow after you guys.

467
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,600
My dad doesn't let me find a boyfriend from out of town.

468
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
All right, no boyfriends.

469
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Why is she like this when she's drunk?

470
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Every Chinese New Year, my relatives gather back home.

471
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
They profess to find me a husband,

472
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,000
so I can give birth to two babies.

473
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
Two babies!

474
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
I don't even have a boyfriend.

475
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
They want me to have two babies! Be careful!

476
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
My aunt is even more outrageous!

477
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
She's insane.

478
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
She took the guy to my home.

479
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,900
Come this way.

480
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,500
- Oh my goodness.
- Be careful.

481
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,479
I just woke up without washing my face.

482
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,880
- Mr. Hu, this way.
- I'm fine.

483
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,400
In the living room,

484
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,000
I saw a guy in a business suit with a tie.

485
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He looked like a sales manager.

486
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Why did she drink so much?

487
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,200
Na Na said the cocktails were strong.

488
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,700
I just woke up, and I didn't even brush my teeth!

489
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,000
How can there be any sparks?

490
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
Your aunt is pretty ridiculous. Let's get in the car first.

491
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,600
Shouldn't we meet outside for a date?

492
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,200
But whenever we went out, it'll be to the milk tea shop.

493
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,600
The weather in July and August was like a pit of fire...

494
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,700
Mr. Hu! Get in the car.

495
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,800
Do you know?

496
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,500
Every date was at the milk tea shop.

497
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,800
The weather in July and August was like a pit of fire!

498
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Xu Hongdou, get in the car.

499
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Hop on.

500
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,800
I had nothing to say to him.

501
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,700
Do you know what he said to me?

502
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
He said that he earned ten grand a month.

503
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,600
Then, he asked me how much I earned as a web novelist.

504
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,700
I said I earned ten grand, too.

505
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,600
Guess what he said next.

506
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
- Na Na, fasten her seat belt.
- He Said.

507
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
Give me your account.

508
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,600
- Xu Hongdou, fasten your seat belt.
- Why does he want my account?

509
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Why should I give him my account?

510
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,200
Fasten your seat belt.

511
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,300
It's ridiculous.

512
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,400
Fortunately, I'm ready for this.

513
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,500
Didn't you realize that Xu Hongdou is drunk, too?

514
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
Quick, play Truth or Dare with her!

515
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,200
We haven't gotten to that stage, okay?

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,900
We just met and chatted a few times.

517
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,339
At most, we could be friends. Right?

518
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,400
You know what he said to me?

519
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,400
He said I could move in with him when I felt like it.

520
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,300
Why should I live with him?

521
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,200
He said he'd empty out half his closet for me.

522
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
We barely know each other, okay?

523
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes.

524
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,300
You have to rain!

525
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,200
I want it to rain for a whole year! You hear me?

526
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Mr. Hu.

527
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
There's a plush toy in the back seat.

528
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
Pass it to me.

529
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,400
Okay.

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There, there.

531
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,100
Why do have this in your car?

532
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
Xiao Hu Lu left it here.

533
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Quick.

534
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,000
My mom doesn't like girls like you who don't put on makeup.

535
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,200
I burst out laughing.

536
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Then, I bought a model kit.

537
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,700
Guess how much it was.

538
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,100
¥2,800.

539
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,700
- That's expensive!
- Is it?

540
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,600
It's just a model kit worth ¥2,800.

541
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,300
Is that expensive?

542
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,400
I bought it without much thought.

543
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Is she crying?

544
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,500
Play Truth or Dare with her.

545
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
- Why do we have to play that?
- You scared me.

546
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,800
Hear this.

547
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
That beast wanted to break up with me,

548
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,400
but he even asked me for milk tea money.

549
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
What are you talking about? I know it all!

550
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,000
He bought me milk tea with discount coupons.

551
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Do you know? He didn't pay!

552
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
- What's going on?
- Of course not!

553
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Then, he said

554
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,400
I won't ask you for the bus fare.

555
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,800
Then, my dad forced me to go on a jog.

556
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,500
After that, he persuaded me to find a job.

557
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,400
I have zero inspiration.

558
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,200
Damai is too tactiturn.

559
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
That's everything suppressed within her.

560
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
It's cold.

561
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
My mom says the same thing.

562
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
That's why you should chat with us more often.

563
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,000
This feels amazing.

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,800
If you were not drunk,

565
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:12,200
we'd never know about your relatives, your aunt, your date,

566
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
your ¥2,800 model kits,

567
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,600
and your dad forcing you to go jogging.

568
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,500
Incredible.

569
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,600
I'm going to quit drinking.

570
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Hongdou, you too.

571
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,900
Hongdou was even more ridiculous.

572
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,000
She kept crying

573
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,800
and listening to "Looking Back" again and again.

574
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Her tears wouldn't stop.

575
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh, that rabbit plushie soaked in your tears belongs to Xiao Hu Lu.

576
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,400
Remember to wash it and return it to Chairman Xie.

577
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
I want to go home.

578
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,800
Here are the sausages.

579
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
- Where are you going?
- I want to take down the clothes.

580
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,499
Do that later. Eat first or the food will get cold.

581
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:06,600
Don't mind it. I'll take these down.

582
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
I can do it after the meal.

583
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,700
Don't bother.

584
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,600
Why are there so many clothes?

585
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
- Mom.
- Sister, leave her be.

586
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
She won't heed a word you say.

587
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't criticize her. Do you even listen to me?

588
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,000
Didn't I tell you to stop contacting Luo Quan unnecessarily?

589
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
I didn't. He keeps sending messages to me on WeChat.

590
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,600
He sent messages to me, too.

591
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,900
He's sending you messages because you reply to him.

592
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,800
If you stop replying, he'll stop too.

593
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,000
I didn't reply.

594
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Well, did you like his posts on Moments?

595
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
He liked mine.

596
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,100
Can you block him?

597
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,600
I have nothing to hide. Why should I block him?

598
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You have to stop treating Luo Quan as our relative.

599
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
He'll get married eventually.

600
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,400
If he's so chummy with his ex-wife's family,

601
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,700
what would his wife and her family think?

602
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,000
We have to keep up appearances.

603
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You're putting in too much effort!

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Mom, are you angry?

605
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
No, I'm not.

606
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,900
Why are you so cranky?

607
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,800
I'm not cranky. I'm just talking louder.

608
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
Have your breakfast.

609
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Luo Quan!

610
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,200
I told you to call me directly!

611
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,100
Don't you understand?

612
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,300
Mom.

613
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
I thought it was Luo Quan.

614
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,400
Why didn't you call me with your phone?

615
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
You're too lazy to get it?

616
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Do you want to talk to Xiao Hu Lu?

617
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Hu Lu, come over. Hu Lu!

618
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,200
It's your grandma. Hurry up.

619
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Grandma, we're having breakfast.

620
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you miss me?

621
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
You don't have to miss me.

622
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,200
My mom said she'll send me over to you during the holidays.

623
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,400
I have a social engagement today.

624
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
She has a social engagement?

625
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Today is the birthday of my good friend, Huzi.

626
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,200
So, I have to socialize this afternoon.

627
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Honghong is going back to Guangzhou,

628
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,800
so she wants to hold the birthday party in advance.

629
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
Look at her. Shes busier than the village director.

630
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,000
Okay, I'll pass the phone to grandma.

631
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,700
Me?

632
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,100
Shuyu, we're good.

633
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,300
You're getting by well, too. Right?

634
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Why didn't you use your phone?

635
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
I bet she's asking Mom to persuade Mr. Bow Legs to go on blind dates.

636
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
Interesting.

637
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
Sorry, sorry. I'm to blame.

638
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Stop keeping in contact with him.

639
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,500
What's wrong, Sister Xiaochun?

640
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,000
What's up?

641
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,900
Your face is like a brooding yaksha in a temple.

642
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,500
My relatives are a mess.

643
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,800
A distressing relative always calls us.

644
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,600
Even my mom has to persuade him to go on blind dates.

645
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm annoyed to the bone.

646
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,400
That means you're on good terms.

647
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
This only happens between people who get along.

648
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,700
Who wants to be on good terms with him?

649
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,600
Get lost! Begone!

650
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,500
As far as possible!

651
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,900
We still have one Peach Blossom to make.

652
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,900
This is the cafe where Na Na works at.

653
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,200
It's very cosy.

654
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
So, I'm not cooped up indoors.

655
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
I leave my room.

656
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I even hung out with Hongdou and Na Na yesterday.

657
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,800
<i>How can you girls go to a bar? That's a rowdy place.</i>

658
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
It's not!

659
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Mr. Hu is a very talented singer at our courtyard.

660
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,500
That's a sober bar run by his friends.

661
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,000
It's a place to listen to music.

662
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,100
Na Na is here.

663
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,400
Let me introduce them.

664
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
My parents.

665
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Hello. Nice to meet you.

666
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>Hello.</i>

667
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
<i>Hello, Nana.</i>

668
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,500
<i>Thank you for celebrating Qingtian's birthday.</i>

669
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,900
You're welcome.

670
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,600
Damai always helps me out.

671
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
She makes supper for me all the time.

672
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
<i>Oh, she knows how to take care of others?</i>

673
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
She's great at it.

674
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,800
<i>Na Na, does she go out?</i>

675
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,000
O-Of course, I do!

676
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,300
<i>Would a darned lass like you go out?</i>

677
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,300
Yes, she does. I take her out to explore.

678
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
All right. Let's end the call.

679
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,400
I need to write my draft.

680
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I'll send videos. I'm hanging up.

681
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,500
<i>Move about after writing for an hour.</i>

682
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,000
<i>Do eye exercises!</i>

683
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
I know. I do them.

684
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,400
<i>Also, destiny brings people together.</i>

685
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,900
<i>Those who treat you well are your benefactors in life.</i>

686
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,800
<i>They're precious gems.</i>

687
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,500
<i>Get along well. Don't quarrel.</i>

688
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,800
Roger that, Mr. Zhou.

689
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Same here, Mr. Zhou.

690
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,900
<i>All right. Goodbye.</i>

691
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,400
Okay, I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

692
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,600
The class is finally over.

693
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Let's eat.

694
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Na Na.

695
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,400
- Let me have a look over there.
- Okay.

696
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Na Na!

697
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
Yes?

698
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,300
Let me pick you up from work when I'm free.

699
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,100
Just like my parents said, I should leave my room more often.

700
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Is this some kind of joke?

701
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,500
Will you ever have free time?

702
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I will do my best to overcome this.

703
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,200
I'll make time.

704
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Really?

705
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,500
Yes!

706
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,900
Do you know how the wind is formed?

707
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,300
Hot air travels toward cold air,

708
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,400
and a cold place warms up.

709
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Once this cold place gets warm, it'll flow to other colder areas.

710
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,700
A new gust of wind is formed.

711
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
What are you saying?

712
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,700
What does this have to do with the flow of wind?

713
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
I'm saying that...

714
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
You're a breeze that flowed to me.

715
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,000
So, I'm inclined to flow to you, too.

716
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,500
I'll treat you well, much better.

717
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Well, since I flowed to you,

718
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,800
our temperatures are the same.

719
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
How can you flow to me?

720
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Silly girl.

721
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,000
Regardless, thank you.

722
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'll treat you even better, too.

723
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
I'll get to work.

724
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,800
Make this one.

725
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,200
<i>[I bawl my eyes out on Xiao Hu Lu's toy rabbit]</i>
Xu Hongdou!

726
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,400
I'm coming!

727
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,300
Don't worry. There's no rush. Take your time.

728
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,100
There's no rush? Take your time?

729
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,800
But you're hollering at my window.

730
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,000
Unscrupulous.

731
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
An unscrupulous man.

732
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,600
<i>[Thatched House]</i>
Let's go.

733
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,700
Just woke up?

734
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
No, I was washing clothes.

735
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,800
Sure. Did you eat?

736
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,100
I had breakfast with Na Na.

737
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,300
Why are you laughing?

738
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,800
I was born with smiling lips.

739
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
My jovial face is natural.

740
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
Consider carefully.

741
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,800
A jovial face is different from the village beau.

742
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,200
You can only have one character setting.

743
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,900
Pony Prince sounds very positive, all right?

744
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,100
Let's talk about the warehouse's personnel.

745
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,600
We'll start with Aunty Feng.

746
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,800
She's in charge of customer service.

747
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
She's righteous and frugal.

748
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,700
It's hard for her to change her personality.

749
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,400
In that case, take her off customer service.

750
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Let someone else do it,

751
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
and get her to dispatch the goods.

752
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Customer service has long working hours,

753
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
and messages have to be sent even after work,

754
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,900
but it has a higher pay than the other jobs.

755
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,200
She was very diligent in learning how to type just for this job.

756
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,000
Eventually, she grasped the ins and outs of the role.

757
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,500
Most importantly, she's dedicated to her job.

758
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,800
I'm not speaking ill of the other ladies,

759
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,500
but she's more capable than many of them combined.

760
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,600
I've never met a boss like you.

761
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
This is how it is in the village.

762
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,500
They always say they saw me running around naked as a kid.

763
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,800
They'll dish out your embarrassing past,

764
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,400
and you don't have any authority before them.

765
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,800
All right.

766
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll try to brainwash Aunty Feng.

767
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
You can do it, Manager Xu. I believe in you.

768
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
I'll try my best.

769
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,600
You sure are modest.

770
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Are you okay?

771
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Manager Xu!

772
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,100
Come here and check this!

773
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,900
They're asking for a refund because it tastes bad.

774
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,200
Is this refund allowed?

775
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,400
Take a look.

776
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,400
- Refund half the price.
- Refund half the price?

777
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
The customer isn't satisfied, so we'll make them happy.

778
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
We can't invite losses, Manager.

779
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,000
Aunty Feng, business always has profits and losses.

780
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,400
We should put ourselves in the shoes of customers

781
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,600
and meet their needs.

782
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,100
Actually, returning goods is fine.

783
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,800
We have return freight insurance.

784
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,600
As long as the goods are fine, we can sell them again.

785
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
I checked these reviews.

786
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Most of them say it's hard to get a refund

787
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,800
or the packaging is poor.

788
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,500
There are also reviews about deliverymen

789
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,700
leaving the parcels at the deposit box without informing the customers.

790
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,100
Some say the taste isn't good.

791
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,600
Someone likes the taste, while others don't.

792
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,800
I've never heard about refunds for bad taste.

793
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,200
They're crossing the line!

794
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Aunty Feng, as long as the customer is unhappy,

795
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,300
- the reviews will be nasty.
- But...

796
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,000
They'll influence the draw of new customers and repurchase rate.

797
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
If we provide good service,

798
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,000
he'd repurchase from us even if he isn't satisfied this time.

799
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,700
They'll also leave a review about our good and efficient service.

800
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,400
Basically, good service builds a positive cycle.

801
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,200
What about opportunistic customers?

802
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,400
They're a minority.

803
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,800
The aim of service is to please customers.

804
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,900
If the customers are pleased, they'll return to us.

805
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,400
Sister Hongdou, when you were a hotel manager,

806
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,800
did you ever meet ridiculously unreasonable guests?

807
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,200
I've met all sorts.

808
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,400
Once, a guest called room service to check out.

809
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,600
He was so bad-tempered that he dumped ice coffee on my face.

810
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,000
One other time, a mosquito flew into a room.

811
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
I was berated by a naked man for an hour.

812
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,600
Butt naked?

813
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,400
How could they be so mean?

814
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
