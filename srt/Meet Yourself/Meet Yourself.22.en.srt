<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,680
What are you thinking about?

4
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm thinking about how there are so many stars.

5
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,880
They're dazzling.

6
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,560
When I was young,

7
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,820
my grandma would tell me stories during the summer.

8
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,400
I'd be lying in the yard.

9
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,520
My grandma had a fan in hand to keep me cool.

10
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,440
She told me the legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl.

11
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,580
She said that a new star appears in the sky after a person dies.

12
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,820
I asked her which one was my grandpa.

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,240
She said it was the one blinking at me.

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,480
Your grandma is right.

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,760
I think people return to the galaxy after their deaths.

16
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,700
You believe in this too?

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm an atheist.

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,160
I believe in science.

19
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,960
I believe that nothing will truly disappear.

20
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Everything in this world has an energy of existence.

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Energy doesn't vanish.

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,220
It can only be passed on endlessly.

23
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,660
So, becoming a star after death has a scientific basis.

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,500
Can we become an animal, a cloud, or a plant?

25
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,960
You'll become something you yearn to be.

26
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,040
What do you want to become?

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,180
My choice?

28
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,260
I'd like to turn into the wind.

29
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,920
The wind?

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,060
When I miss someone, I can gently waft over to them.

31
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,080
They can sense me.

32
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,220
If that's what you wish, you'll definitely turn into the wind.

33
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,740
That's because energy is produced even in thought.

34
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,240
That's magical!

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,880
Don't probe. If you do, it'll become a scientific inquiry.

36
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,000
What about you?

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,160
What do you want to turn into?

38
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,540
I'd like to turn into the rain.

39
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,480
Why?

40
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,920
But I believe Chen Nanxing will definitely turn into a star.

41
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,280
When she was born, her dad noticed that it was about daybreak.

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,320
The South Star was shining brightly in the distance.

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
So, he gave her the name Nanxing.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,900
The South Star?

45
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,620
We're in the Northern Hemisphere.

46
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,380
We can't see the South Star.

47
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,240
When it's dawn, we might be able to see the Morning Star.

48
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,120
That's in the east.

49
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,240
We can't see the South Star?

50
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,500
Nope.

51
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,880
Her dad probably got it wrong,

52
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
but that's fine.

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,840
She'd turn into a star anyway.

54
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,680
There are so many stars twinkling.

55
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,520
I can't tell which one is my grandma, or grandpa, or Chen Nanxing.

56
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,060
No matter which ones they are, they're looking at you.

57
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,780
Can they see me?

58
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,380
Of course.

59
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,900
They all hope that you are happy

60
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,700
and living a good life.

61
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,600
I always think so and assure myself,

62
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,680
but I have too many regrets,

63
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,300
too much I'm reluctant to let go of,

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,080
too much remorse,

65
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,100
and too many lingering attachments.

66
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,920
Look. We had a lot of time,

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,920
but we never traveled together.

68
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,040
She must've been in pain for a long time,

69
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,620
but I never expressed...

70
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,480
any concern for her.

71
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,180
I wasn't even by her side...

72
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,700
when she was dying. She left this world alone.

73
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,240
Each time I had fun with you guys, I'd feel upset the next second.

74
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,480
I just wish you guys could also be friends with her.

75
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,400
You guys would love her

76
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,700
because she's a wonderful girl.

77
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Well, tell me about her.

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,420
What was she like?

79
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,960
She was a very pure and bubbly person.

80
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Each time she was around, the weather didn't matter.

81
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,940
Be it sun, rain, snow, hail, or wind,

82
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,500
you'd feel that it was a great day.

83
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,760
Can there really be such a mystical person who makes every weather perfect?

84
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,960
She was my wonder woman.

85
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,720
I trust that.

86
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,940
She's not here, and you're so depressed at the thought of her.

87
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,760
However, you're delighted when you talk about her.

88
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,560
That's true.

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Why?

90
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,960
That's because the utterance of her name brings her to life.

91
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,220
When you stop talking about her,

92
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,460
she'll truly vanish from this world.

93
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,740
Unlike the countless strangers in this world,

94
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,980
I might not be acquaintances with Chen Nanxing,

95
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,040
but she exists.

96
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,260
Those random strangers

97
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,500
don't exist to me in a certain sense.

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,440
When you see me,

99
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,780
talk to others about me

100
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,060
and think about me, time and again,

101
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,060
I'll be with you.

- Holding our bladders.

Can't we compete over something else?

I can chat with you on the road.

144

Sure.

145
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,500
Old Hu!

146
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Take Chairman Xie's car later!

147
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,640
- Here, take this.
- Sure.

148
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,120
Xia Xia! Stack them properly. The road back is bumpy.

149
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
Okay.

150
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
Is there space for two more bags?

151
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,700
Yes.

152
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,720
We can leave them in the back seat, too.

153
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,600
Check one more time. See if you left anything behind.

154
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,080
Nope, this is everything.

155
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,800
I'll get these delivered in the afternoon.

156

Don't worry.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,080
I'll send you anything you forgot to take back.

158
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,260
I don't want to part with you guys!

159
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,040
We'll stay in touch.

160
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,540
Not again.

161
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,100
We've already had so many farewell meals.

162
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,400
- Get going.
- Come on.

163
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go.

164
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
- Is this the only one?
- Yes, just this one.

165
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
- Okay.
- Off you go.

166
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,940
How is it?

167
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,540
Does it taste good?

168
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,520
It's a little weird.

169
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,940
A strong seafood smell.

170
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,500
That's because I added fish mint.

171
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,440
Why did you add that?

172
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,380
Don't you locals like the taste of it?

173
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,980
We don't cook it this way.

174
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,700
<i>[Damai: I boarded the plane. Don't worry.]</i>

175
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,000
<i>[Have a safe trip. Let me know when you land.]</i>

176
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,540
Why are you upset?

177
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,800
Damai left.

178
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,260
Isn't it time for you to leave?

179
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm not leaving.

180
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,920
You have to leave sooner or later.

181
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,000
That's not right now.

182
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,420
Next year?

183
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,760
Next year is still miles away.

184
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,920
I don't know, and I have no plans.

185
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,980
It seems far away,

186
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,840
but time flies.

187
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,820
What the heck is this taste?

188
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,680
I shouldn't have added fish mint.

189
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,680
I didn't want to be blunt.

190
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,380
Hongdou hasn't come over lately.

191
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,400
What's she busy with?

192
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,180
A female tenant is leaving,

193
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,060
so they've been having meals together.

194
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,240
Has she left.

195
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

196
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,860
Well, invite her over for dinner tonight.

197
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll make scallion pancakes.

198
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,440
Did you hear me?

199
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,660
Yes, I heard you.

200
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,840
All done.

201
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,120
It smells great.

202
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,760
Text A'Yao. Ask him when he'll be back for dinner.

203
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,140
Okay.

204
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,140
Granny, he said Aunty Baoping wants him to stay for dinner.

205
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,120
He asked us not to wait for him.

206
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,280
Well, let's eat.

207
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,120
Calm down. Take your time to explain.

208
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,060
<i>M-My dad is outrageous.</i>

209
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,680
<i>I already promised to leave the house four days a week.</i>

210
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,760
<i>I even wrote a guarantee.</i>

211
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,460
<i>He said he had a present for me.</i>

212
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,940
<i>I... I was pretty excited,</i>

213
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,820
but it turned out like this!

214
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,480
What's wrong with Damai?

215
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
Her dad gave her a gift.

216
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,260
<i>Hongdou, are you there?</i>

217
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,300
Yes, I am.

218
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,780
I'm in the kitchen.

219
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,300
Turn on your camera. Show us the gift from your dad.

220
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,560
<i>Hold on.</i>

221
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,820
It's so cute!

222
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,420
Why are you peeing again?

223
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,360
<i>I'll mop it later.</i>

224
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,140
<i>How is it cute?</i>

225
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,640
<i>My dad said I have to walk it four days a week.</i>

226
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
<i>Four days!</i>

227
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,940
<i>It can pee in the toilet on the days we don't walk.</i>

228
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,020
<i>But dogs should have walks daily!</i>

229
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,800
I wouldn't have come back if I knew this would happen!

230
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,420
Your dad is impressive.

231
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,500
As expected of a teacher struggling with students daily.

232
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,780
Damai, I can really understand how you feel.

233
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,020
Poor girl.

234
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
I have to end the call.

235
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,880
The floor needs to be mopped.

236
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,160
You should finish that bowl of plain noodles quickly or they'll clump together.

237
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,740
I can't guarantee its taste.

238
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,020
You've added lard oil. How can it taste bad?

239
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,960
Has something been on your mind lately?

240
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,900
No.

241
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,660
Are you reluctant to leave?

242
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,740
A little,

243
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,180
but I can't keep spending my time so leisurely. Right?

244
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,600
I have to return to an ordinary life and job.

245
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,540
What about you and Chairman Xie?

246
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,480
What about us?

247
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,280
You stargazed with him outside the tent when we went camping.

248
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,360
I saw everything.

249
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,160
<i>Xinxin, didn't you sleep well yesterday?</i>

250
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,980
<i>I can chat with you on the road.</i>

251
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,540
<i>Sure.</i>

252
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,660
<i>Old Hu!</i>

253
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,400
<i>Take Chairman Xie's car later!</i>

254
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,540
<i>Xia Xia! Stack them properly.</i>

255
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,560
<i>- The road back is bumpy.
- Okay.</i>

256
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,580
<i>Here, let me carry it.</i>

257
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,320
<i>Come on, Xia Xia.</i>

258
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,260
So what?

259
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,840
What‘s with that answer?

260
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,660
A chance and a catalyst have appeared.

261
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Something has started.

262
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't you want to progress further?

263
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
How can I do that?

264
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,300
You can video call him.

265
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,800
That's just keeping in touch.

266
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,230
Our souls are only nourished

267
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,100
through physical warmth and intimacy.

268
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,960
In a new environment,

269
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,920
it's easy to lower your guard...

270
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,480
once you start to relax.

271
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,520
Someone can wander into your heart by accident.

272
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,400
But I'm just a tourist.

273
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,040
I don't belong here.

274
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,520
He's already wandered in.

275
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,660
What can you do?

276
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,980
I don't know either.

277
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,700
I've never been in such a situation before.

278
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,780
I have no experience.

279
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,720
So, I've been trying to avoid him lately.

280
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,460
Hongdou, do you feel happier meeting him or avoiding him?

281
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm happy to see him.

282
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,100
Have you ever had a crush on someone in school?

283
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,540
Yes.

284
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,460
I had a high school classmate who excelled at his studies.

285
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,800
We sat across the aisle from each other.

286
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Would the sight of him make your day?

287
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,420
Even if he only said a word to you

288
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,360
or touched your textbook briefly,

289
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,600
you'd be over the moon.

290
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,660
Yes.

291
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,780
That's precisely it!

292
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,960
Use your imagination.

293
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,400
What's the difference between then and now?

294
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,340
You're happy to see him.

295
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,800
Stay happy.

296
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,860
Buddy, you have to leave someday.

297
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,740
Every moment of happiness counts.

298
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,460
Don't be hard on yourself or fight with your feelings.

299
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,220
You're still on holiday anyway.

300
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,100
That makes sense.

301
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,780
I have more experience in love than you do.

302
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,900
My words can be trusted.

303
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,480
I want to be Monkey King! I want to be Monkey King!

304
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,780
You can only be Pigsy since you lost.

305
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,500
I don't care! I want to be Monkey King!

306
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,060
Guobao, can you be Monk Sha?

307
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,240
No! I want to be Monkey King!

308
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,580
How can you guys bully Guobao again?

309
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,080
I asked you to get along.

310
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,280
No one bullied him. He wants to be Monkey King.

311
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,220
Let him be that.

312
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm Monkey King.

313
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,880
Aren't you Ultraman?

314
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,200
Why are you Monkey King now?

315
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,620
Ultraman isn't in Journey to the West.

316
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,940
Be quiet.

317
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,740
Let's discuss this.

318
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,340
Can we remove Pigsy from Journey to the West and let Ultraman join in?

319
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,440
No, we can't. We have to take Pigsy with us.

320
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,840
Ultraman has to fight monsters in the city.

321
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,260
Okay, fine.

322
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,980
Guobao! Guobao! Listen up!

323
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,780
You're in kindergarten now. Does anyone else roll on the ground like you?

324
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,540
- I want to be Monkey King!
- Fine!

325
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,700
Jiabao is coming back this Sunday.

326
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll let your sister pull you up.

327
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,300
Aren't you going to keep rolling about?

328
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,120
Come over here.

329
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,560
I'll take you to wash your face.

330
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,040
You guys, listen up.

331
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,720
You have to get along. Don't stir trouble.

332
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,340
If you're roleplaying Journey to the West,

333
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,980
you have to take turns being Monk Tang, Monk Sha, Pigsy, and Monkey King. Got it?

334
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,540
No way, I'm Monk Tang.

335
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,820
Why are you bent on being a monk?

336
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,500
Monk Tang has a noble dream. So do I.

337
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,400
So, I'm Monk Tang.

338
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Fine.

339
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,720
Xiao Hu Lu, as long as you can add and subtract within ten,

340
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,820
you can be a nun, a monk, or whatever you like.

341
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,380
Okay?

342
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,840
All right, let's wash your face.

343
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,440
Goodness, Guobao.

344
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,600
You're too old to be wailing in public.

345
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,340
Aren't you embarrassed?

346
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,900
A'Feng! I'm here.

347
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,740
Where are they?

348
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,940
They went out to eat.

349
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,780
What are you eating?

350
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,540
Vegetable dumplings.

351
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,300
Brother A'Chang is already suffering from anemia. What are you doing?

352
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,120
Do you also want to suffer from anemia?

353
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,280
I added eggs in them.

354
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,600
Eggs?

355
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
How many will you even bear to add?

356
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
I know you best.

357
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,160
These only contain vegetables.

358
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,520
Stop weaving this.

359
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,480
I brought you good food.

360
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,260
What delicacies did Xiao Xi send you this time?

361
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,240
These aren't from Xiao Xi. I made this myself.

362
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,400
- Yellow beef ribs.
- Yellow beef?

363
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,540
Have a taste. Try one.

364
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,420
Does it taste good?

365
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,880
You're a marvelous cook.

366
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,100
Finish everything. Eat up.

367
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,960
Look at yourself.

368
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
You need to eat more meat. Got it?

369
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,920
When Xie Qiang is released

370
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,880
and he sees both of you gaunt from illnesses,

371
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,840
how would he feel? How would he feel?

372
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,680
Eat up. Finish everything!

373
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,040
Got it? I'll eat the vegetable dumplings.

374
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,080
How is it?

375
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,860
Delicious.

376
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,400
Grains are the best.

377
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,540
I'm not eating that. I won't.

378
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,640
Take one. No!

379
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
You eat it.

380
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,820
I can eat this. It's tasty.

381
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,820
Okay, settle this payment first.

382
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,300
Okay.

383
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,980
Brother, Hongdou is about to leave our cafe.

384
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,920
After some thought, I think it's best to recruit another worker.

385
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,440
Didn't I ask you to do that ages ago?

386
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,740
I wasn't aware of these service problems.

387
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,120
Hongdou has set new standards for us.

388
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,380
We should keep them.

389
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,500
Okay. You can take charge of it.

390
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,440
I'll deal with it, then.

391
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay. I'm off.

392
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,640
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

393
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,580
Uncle, is the foal doing well?

394
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,180
Yes, it is.

395
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,300
Here you go. I brought you some carrots.

396
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,760
Okay.

397
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,060
Why are you running so fast?

398
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm asking you a question!

399
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,540
What are you doing?

400
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,960
That's none of your business!

401
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,680
Xiao Qin! You!

402
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,160
Second Brother.

403
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,220
What's wrong?

404
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,320
Did you quarrel with your dad again?

405
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,360
I thought he stopped forcing you to learn embroidery.

406
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,940
He doesn't like Yang Zhinan.

407
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,200
Who's Yang Zhinan?

408
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,960
A staff member of a homestay in the town.

409
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
My boyfriend.

410
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,200
You're in a relationship?

411
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,780
Congratulations.

412
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,760
Why doesn't your dad like him?

413
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,860
He thinks the guy isn't dependable because he's much younger than me.

414
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,040
How old is he?

415
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,800
He's already 19 years old.

416
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,760
Five years younger than you?

417
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,920
So what?

418
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,300
It's nothing.

419
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,540
I just didn't know about this.

420
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,520
Come over here. Let me tell you.

421
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,240
He wooed me.

422
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,920
He was a frequent customer at my place, but that raised my suspicions.

423
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,800
They have a convenience store right in front of the homestay.

424
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,720
So, I asked him if he had a crush on me.

425
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,920
He ran off in fright.

426
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,200
The next day, he started to order takeouts for me.

427
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,600
The takeouts aren't the reason.

428
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm not an easy catch.

429
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,280
He had to woo me for a long time before I agreed.

430
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,320
How long?

431
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,740
More than a week.

432
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,760
Actually, I wanted to start the relationship on the first day.

433
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,060
Am I supposed to wait until the next Double Third Festival to sing him a love confession?

434
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,000
Your dad is old.

435
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
It's hard for him to keep up with modern ideas.

436
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,540
Don't be mad at him.

437
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm not.

438
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,800
He just doesn't seem pleased by anything I do.

439
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,120
Today, we went to harvest scallions.

440
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,700
He was worried about my mom, so he made my mom stay at home.

441
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,220
I'm worried about him.

442
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,500
So, I closed the store to go with him.

443
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,160
He kept complaining that I'd only cause trouble.

444
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,660
He even said I've been a sloth with no ambitions since young.

445
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,640
Then, he started criticizing Yang Zhinan endlessly.

446
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,040
That's why I flared up!

447
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,000
You share your mom's temper.

448
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,020
Yes.

449
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,580
He has to spare a thought for me.

450
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,120
It's in my genes.

451
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,480
But he said I was an imp.

452
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,120
I never learned anything decent.

453
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,200
Even my boyfriend isn't any good.

454
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,000
What's a good boyfriend?

455
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,040
Isn't someone I like a good boyfriend?

456
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,000
You're right.

457
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,260
Right?

458
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,560
Uncle A'Yao, your words are always pleasant to the ears.

459
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,620
Since you've finished chatting with me, get on with harvesting scallions.

460
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,820
There's no rush. Let's chat.

461
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,760
Tell me about how you're doing.

462
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,500
Be frank with me. Are you dating Xu Hongdou from the courtyard?

463
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,000
Not that again.

464
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,040
I told you, she's a tenant. Her lease will end next month.

465
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,200
Is she really leaving?

466
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,520
I thought you were pretty fond of her.

467
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,000
I like her, too.

468
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
She's so fair.

469
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,040
Uncle A'Yao, you're already so old.

470
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,380
Girls won't want you if you don't take the initiative.

471
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,440
Woo her. Make her stay.

472
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,460
I bet you'll have to woo her for quite some time.

473
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,820
Leave once you're done talking.

474
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,940
Stop gabbing all that nonsense. You're just like your dad.

475
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,420
Uncle A'Yao, how could you say that?

476
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,040
How am I like my dad?

477
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,920
I'm showing concern for you!

478
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm busy!

479
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,560
Get on with your own task.

480
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,580
Yang Zhinan is much better.

481
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,560
Yang Zhinan is the best in this world.

482
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Hongdou likes eating chicken. Invite her over.

483
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,680
Let's not. She probably ate her dinner by now.

484
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,580
Try asking.

485
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,920
I won't.

486
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Ask her.

487
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,400
I won't. You can do it if you want to.

488
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,900
Hongdou!

489
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,040
Don't shout!

490
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,760
What's wrong with you?

491
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,160
Well, what's wrong with you?

492
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,040
Why are you pestering me to invite her over?

493
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,820
She's leaving soon. Don't you know?

494
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,240
I know.

495
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,900
That's why I want her to join us for more meals.

496
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,200
I know what's on your mind.

497
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,920
Quash those thoughts.

498
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,820
What's on my mind?

499
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,500
Say it. What's on my mind?

500
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,920
Say it!

501
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
Granny!

502
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
Xu Hongdou is a tourist.

503
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
You have to accept reality and give up on these fantasies.

504
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,840
Stop inviting her over for meals all the time.

505
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
She just feels bad to refuse.

506
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
You've never invited the other tenants over.

507
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,420
That's not nice.

508
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,620
Why are you staring at me?

509
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,160
Invite Hongdou over for dinner.

510
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,560
Do it yourself. I'm eating out.

511
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,200
Where are you going this late?

512
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,760
A'Yao, I won't invite her.

513
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,600
I won't invite her, okay?

514
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,600
Here you go. Your skewers are ready.

515
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,420
- Okay.
- Thanks.

516
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,960
You're welcome.

517
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,940
What's wrong?

518
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,660
You've been sitting here silently.

519
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,500
What's wrong?

520
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,780
You were busy.

521
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,960
Who am I supposed to chat with?

522
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,000
Tell me the truth. Did the deal with the bookstore fall through?

523
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,280
Can't you be more positive about me?

524
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,420
I want to be optimistic,

525
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,600
but you're always sitting here with a can of beer.

526
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,580
Your face will always be so gloomy.

527
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,740
I bet a deal didn't go well.

528
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,360
I'm not fated to own a big company in this life.

529
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,000
I can't bear the stress.

530
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,960
Every time I hear about your deals falling through,

531
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,040
I feel like I'm on a roller coaster. It's just endless ups and downs.

532
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,540
Enough with the roller coaster.

533
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
This isn't about the bookstore.

534
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,480
It's something personal.

535
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,680
Something personal?

536
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,000
What personal problems can you have?

537
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,540
Did Xu Hongdou say something to you?

538
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,120
What would she say to me?

539
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,480
Well, you must've said something to her.

540
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,740
I didn't say a thing.

541
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,900
Well, talk to her!

542
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,500
It's pointless for you to drown your sorrows in alcohol here.

543
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,560
You have to tell her. Talk to her.

544
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,660
What am I supposed to say?

545
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,120
Tell her whatever you wish to tell her.

546
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,740
I have nothing to say.

547
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,980
Stop that pretense before me.

548
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,940
I know you well enough.

549
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,260
You'd be candid if you had nothing to hide.

550
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,640
You've developed feelings for her,

551
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,140
so you're shifty-eyed and evasive when it comes to her.

552
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,200
See? So shady.

553
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,960
Keep your voice down. The kids will hear you.

554
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,700
What do they know?

555
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,880
Don't worry.

556
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,400
I didn't want to expose your feelings,

557
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,440
but you two are pretty compatible and get along well.

558
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,720
Confess your feelings to her.

559
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,440
What should I do after that?

560
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
What do you mean?

561
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,840
Give up if she rejects you.

562
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,500
But I think she has feelings for you.

563
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,900
Fine.

564
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,020
Let's assume she has feelings for me.

565
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,560
Then what?

566
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,980
Isn't that obvious?

567
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,380
You can be a couple.

568
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,640
How are we supposed to do that?

569
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,700
Why are you asking me about that?

570
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,580
You'll... be a couple.

571
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,900
I can't figure that out.

572
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,300
Are we supposed to have a long-distance relationship with me here and her in Beijing?

573
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
Well, try to make her stay.

574
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,000
Why is making her stay your only solution?

575
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,500
Why can't I leave with her?

576
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,380
That's because... you can't possibly leave with her.

577
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,900
Are you going to leave everything behind and leave with her? That's impossible.

578
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,000
Since I can't leave with her, how can I ask her to stay just for me?

579
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,280
Why do men take it for granted that women have to sacrifice and compromise for love?

580
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,560
Why do men only need to offer promises

581
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,020
that they will treat their partners well for life?

582
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,100
That's not what I think.

583
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,800
I just think love requires mutual understanding.

584
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,330
You already said that I can't leave with her.

585
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,240
How can there be mutual understanding?

586
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,760
Fine, fine.

587
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,100
You're the one in love with her, not me.

588
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,500
Well, what are your plans?

589
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,520
I don't know.

590
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm frantic because I don't know.

591
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,160
I miss her when I'm away from her.

592
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,200
But when I meet her, I don't know what to say.

593
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,320
I just feel like I'm an idiot right now, you know?

594
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,920
You're an utter idiot right now.

595
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,260
All right. Drink up.

596
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,000
Jokes aside, you're thinking too much.

597
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,460
You work your brain too much every day.

598
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,760
It's understandable that you ponder carefully over work,

599
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,980
but you're taking too much into consideration about love.

600
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,800
Don't you feel tired?

601
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,820
Here's what I think. Don't bother about the future.

602
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,740
Just treat her well. Do your best to be nice to her.

603
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,100
When she leaves, she can still remember your kindness.

604
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,460
All right.

605
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,520
Muse over this yourself.

606
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,220
Mom, tell me a story.

607
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,880
I can't tell you a story today. I'm working.

608
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,580
You haven't finished the book Uncle A'Yao gave to you, right?

609
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,220
Mom, I heard Uncle's secret today.

610
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,820
What secret?

611
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,520
Uncle likes Sister Hongdou.

612
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,420
That's not a secret.

613
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,420
Mom, he didn't tell you. How did you know?

614
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,940
That's because I've been on that path before.

615
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,900
What path is that?

616
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,520
It's a long story.

617
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,120
Simply put, I fell in love before.

618
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,640
So, I know how people behave when they're in love.

619
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,360
Are you talking about my dad?

620
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,480
Before I met your dad,

621
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,280
I fell in love with someone else once.

622
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,760
Who's that?

623
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,700
He was my deskmate in my third year of high school.

624
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,360
He was excellent at his studies.

625
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,220
His looks were also very handsome.

626
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,900
He was slightly tan,

627
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,640
and he had a dimple on his right cheek when he smiled.

628
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,240
<i>What are you telling your kid?</i>

629
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Mom! Why are you eavesdropping?

630
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,680
<i>I didn't. Go to bed.</i>

631
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,420
Okay, fine. We'll go to bed.

632
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Go to bed.

633
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,880
Mom, I want to read before sleeping.

634
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,520
Okay, read your book.

635
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,800
I'll fiddle with my phone for a while.

636
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,280
<i>[Why are you sitting over there?]</i>

637
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,460

638
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,940
