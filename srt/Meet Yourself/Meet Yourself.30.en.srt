Dou'er! Time to get going.

4
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,300
Our taxi will be here soon.

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,600
Come on. You're already so gorgeous.

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,760
My bag.

7
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,780
Here you go!

8
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,240
Carry it.

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,220
Be careful on your trip.

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Sister, I'm off.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Do your best. Don't come back crying.

12
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,699
Be quiet.

13
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,800
Can't you say something more auspicious?

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,319
Hello! Hello! May you be prosperous! May you be prosperous!

15
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,259
Look at you two. Come on, move it.

16
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,180
Well, Dou'er. You have a transfer flight, so here's some food for the journey.

17
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,619
She can buy these everywhere. Don't add to her baggage.

18
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,979
- I prepared these for her!
- Come on, get going.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,400
Goodness.

20
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,179
Don't forget to call me when you arrive.

21
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,820
Yeah, I know.

22
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,499
- If you're busy, just send me messages.
- Okay.

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
Be careful.

24
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,979
- I'm off.
- Goodbye.

25
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,300
- Okay, smile.
- Excuse me. Please give me a minute.

26
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,460
One, two, three.

27
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,699
Xiao Xin, be careful!

28
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,139
The customers are urging us.

29
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,540
- You wash this. I'll take over.
- Okay.

30
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,660
Mom! Can you call Uncle and ask him when he'll arrive?

31
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,979
Listen to me. I'm very busy now.

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't be impatient. Have a seat over there. Okay?

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
But...

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Both of you, calm down.

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll call him right away.

36
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,520
Why is it so crowded?

37
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,780
The tour bus broke down.

38
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,520
Uncle, let's go.

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,620
Wait a moment. The lion dance will only start at twelve.

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,900
- Where's Na Na?
- She has a day off.

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,379
It's so busy today. Why don't you call her and ask for her help?

42
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,460
She's not around. She's going to the airport to meet her partner.

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,000
- She has a boyfriend?
- I don't know.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
Take Xiao Hu Lu to the lion dance performance. She's been waiting for you.

45
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,419
- Uncle, let's go.
- Why?

46
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,620
Tuotuo and the rest are definitely there.

47
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,299
Uncle, come on.

48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,000
- Okay, let's go. Bye.
- Be good.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,279
Let's go. Off to watch the lion dance!

50
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,620
Hello, Hongdou.

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,479
Okay, I'm at the entrance now. Come on out.

52
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,540
I see you.

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,120
Hongdou! Hongdou!

54
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,900
Granny.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,460
Hongdou!

56
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,900
Why are you back here?

57
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,619
Why didn't A'Yao tell me?

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,139
I haven't told him. I'll talk with you later, Granny.

59
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,899
You're back! That's great!

60
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,539
What do you want for lunch?

61
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,139
I'll call A'Yao to buy it for you.

62
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,740
No, don't. I'm going to meet him now.

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,480
Okay.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,559
A new store opened.

65
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,900
He promised to watch the lion dance with Xiao Hu Lu.

66
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,399
I know. See you at home. I'm off.

67
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,120
Take care.

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,960
Great.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,620
<i>Excellent!</i>

70
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,800

71
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,100
<i>Wow!</i>

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,480
Uncle! Uncle!

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Over there!

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,680
What?

75
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,960
I saw Sister Hongdou.

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,100
Maybe they just looked similar.

77
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,359
Do you still want to watch the lion dance? I'll put you down if you're done with watching this.

78
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,840
My neck hurts.

79
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,659
- No, I want to watch more!
<i>- Great!</i>

80
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You're so little. How can you run into the crowd.

81
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,220
If you fall, you'll be trampled over easily.

82
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,939
But I can't see.

83
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,619
You still shouldn't squeeze in the crowd!

84
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,760
Sister, didn't you leave?

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm back.

86
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll tell you something.

87
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,200
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

88
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,040
<i>Great!</i>

89
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,139
Tuotuo, what's wrong?

90
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,979
Sister Na Na brought someone to view the homestay.

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,130
She asked you to go over.

92
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,300
Sister Na Na? Who is she with? Why did she get you to tell me?

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,059
Sister Na Na brought someone to view the homestay.

94
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,980
- She asked you to go over.
- Okay.

95
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,779
Sister Na Na brought someone to view the homestay.

96
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,059
She asked you to go over.

97
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,660
Okay, I know.

98
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,400

Hello! I'm Xie...

102
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,199
Hello. I'm Xu Hongdou.

103
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,060
What's with this reaction?

104
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,820
Are you startled?

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Xie Zhiyao, no way.

106
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Are you going to cry from excitement?

107
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,780
What's with this sudden ambush?

108
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,760
It's not sudden at all.

109
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,100
I've contemplated over this for ages.

110
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,340
I bet you planned this!

111
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,399
Yes, I did. I wanted to see your reaction.

112
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,680
Well, why are you staring at me through your phone?

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm recording a video.

114
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,900
I bet you're afraid of crying from excitement.

115
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,640
How can you be so confident?

116
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,760
Look at you.

117
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,020
I... I didn't wash my hair yesterday.

118
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah, I can see that.

119
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,380
Usually, I wash my hair every day.

120
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,939
Xie Zhiyao, it's not the first day I've known you.

121
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,940
Why did you come here?

122
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,300
Why?

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,520
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to view the homestay.

124
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,760
Weren't you the one who persuaded me to start a career here?

125
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,119
Didn't you say you'd wait for the bookstore to open first?

126
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,939
It's a good bargain now.

127
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,980
The perfect time to invest.

128
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,059
The opening of Shaohua Bookstore will bring a lot of benefits.

129
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,780
The price will go up.

130
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,600
Since I've got the best insider information,

131
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,179
why shouldn't I invest now?

132
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,340
Am I supposed to wait for the prices to go up?

133
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,200
You're going to run a homestay here?

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,540
Didn't I make myself clear?

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,859
A business venture is risky.

136
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,959
Thank you for your concern, but I've found my business partner.

137
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,319
- Who is it?
- It's a secret for now.

138
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,100
Am I welcome here?

139
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,980
Have you really thought this through?

140
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,159
- If I'm not welcome, so be it.
- That's not it.

141
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,930
You're definitely welcome here.

142
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,530

143
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,740

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,460
♫ <i>Let me hold your hand, baby</i> ♫

167
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,800
♫ <i>Nothing will change, my babe</i> ♫

168
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,660
♫ <i>So I need to confirm if you like me like I wanted you</i> ♫

169
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:06,000
♫ <i>You need to validate, validate my love for you</i> ♫

170
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,580
Jiahui.

171
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm back, Jiahui.

172
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,420
Didn't you find Chairman Xie?

173
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,920
A new store is opening, so he went to help out.

174
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,479
Your luggage is in your room.

175
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,979
I haven't told Xiaochun about your rent renewal.

176
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,720
Remember to call her and let her know.

177
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,880
Okay.

178
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
Do you want a drink?

179
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,860
Coffee, please.

180
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,340
Okay.

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm back.

182
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,219
It's clean, right?

183
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,459
I swept the room twice. Here you go.

184
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,100
Thank you.

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,060
Did you only bring one suitcase?

186
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,580
My mom will send the rest over.

187
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,079
Is there anything else I can help with tidying?

188
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,680
Nope.

189
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,939
I didn't bring much this time. I just need a bed for me to sleep in.

190
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,900
Do you think our homestay

191
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,060
will bring in big bucks?

192
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,600
Lower your expectations.

193
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,739
Let's focus on surviving first.

194
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,780
We can take our time.

195
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,400
Yes, take our time.

196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,720
We don't have a rosy path to walk on.

197
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,639
Once it's open, we'll have to deal with guestrooms, deal with the kitchen,

198
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,639
and deal with clogged drains.

199
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,360
Be prepared.

200
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,680
I'm looking forward.

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,280
Na Na, I didn't think we'd end up as business partners and run a homestay.

202
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Neither did I expect that you'd come back to take over a homestay.

203
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,840
<i>Partnering with me to run a homestay?</i>

204
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,659
<i>Are you serious?</i>

205
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,499
<i>Yes.</i>

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,520
<i>You're pretty rich, aren't you?</i>

207
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,300
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

208
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,580
<i>Want to join me?</i>

209
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,746
<i>Actually, I can find another partner.</i>

210
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:23,840
<i>But I've considered this, and you're the perfect person.</i>

211
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,779
<i>You can handle the cafe in the homestay's lobby.</i>

212
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,580
<i>I trust you.</i>

213
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,880
<i>Are you trying to poach Chairman Xie's employee?</i>

214
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,220
<i>It's every man for himself.</i>

215
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,639
<i>Isn't being your own boss better than working for someone else?</i>

216
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,840
<i>Xu Hongdou,</i>

217
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,400
<i>you've shattered my impression of you.</i>

218
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,300
<i>I love you like this.</i>

219
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,439
My mom said this project was a good investment,

220
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,399
and my dad said the funds aren't huge.

221
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,900
So, I can do as I please.

222
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,139
I look forward to working with you.

223
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,020
Me, too.

224
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,260
Come on. Get this on the plate.

225
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,499
Shall I leave some for you?

226
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,619
There's no need.

227
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,979
I have other dishes.

228
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay.

229
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,119
Are you sure you won't join us?

230
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,239
I won't join.

231
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:23,259
A large crowd is noisy.

232
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,399
Hurry up and bring this over.

233
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,019
Okay, fine. I'm off.

234
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,500
Okay.

235
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,600
<i>This way!</i>

236
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,000
<i>Don't order me around. I have my own style.</i>

237
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,780
Over here!

238
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:40,439
Xiao Bai told me this when she massaged me.

239
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,380
For shoulders, these two areas are the most important.

240
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,740
Guess Xiao Bai's age.

241
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,379
In her thirties or forties?

242
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,580
She's in her twenties!

243
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,440
Xiao Bai's daughter is in her last year of high school.

244
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,219
Really? She looks so young.

245
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,359
- Hongdou.
- Isn't Xinxin back yet?

246
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,439
She'll be back soon.

247
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,740
- Thanks, Sister Hongdou.
- You're welcome.

248
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,299
- The wine is ready.
- Come on.

249
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,780
- You're pretty.
- You're prettier.

250
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,999
Hongdou, I missed you. You're finally back.

251
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:12,240
Welcome back. We missed you loads.

252
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,780
Welcome back.

253
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,301
- Just a little.
- Okay, thank you.

254
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,759
A little bit.

255
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,580
Thank you.

256
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,380
Be good.

257
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,139
Mr. Hu.

258
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,320
- Thank you.
- Over here.

259
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,159
- Mr. Hu!
- Stop eating.

260
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,119
Let the elderly eat first.

261
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,480
How can we eat first?

262
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,199
Tuotuo is such a sensible boy!

263
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,359
I'm sensible, too! I was just trying the food!

264
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,560
Come on, guys.

265
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,339
Stir-fried steak with mint.

266
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,419
Is that the last one?

267
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,480
- Yes.
- Put it in front of Chuchu. She loves steak.

268
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,840
- Okay, no problem.
- It's okay even if you put it there.

269
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,580
Sit down.

270
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,999
A'Yao, why isn't your granny here?

271
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,999
I invited her, but she said it was too noisy here.

272
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:03,079
She told me that when we are done eating, we can play Mahjong with her back home.

273
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,660
Okay, great.

274
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,679
A'Yao prepared such a lavish dinner just for Hongdou's return.

275
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,520
Some would even think we're celebrating a wedding.

276
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,240
That's exactly what it is.

277
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,679
A'Yao, how about holding an engagement ceremony right now?

278
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,319
- What?
- Don't talk nonsense.

279
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,420
Tomorrow, rumors will spread throughout the village again!

280
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,539
Today, we've gathered to welcome

281
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,619
and thank Ms. Xu Hongdou

282
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,119
for supporting our village's tourism development!

283
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,320
- Awesome!
- Welcome, Hongdou!
- Thank you!

284
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,599
Thanks, everyone.

285
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,339
I really hope you'll take good care of me.

286
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,440
Please kindly forgive me for any troubles I may bring.

287
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
Hongdou, don't be so modest.

288
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,739
Bother A'Yao as much as you want.

289
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,279
Make him help you.

290
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,879
He's pleased to be of service to you, right?

291
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,479
Aunty Feng, stop teasing me. Goodness.

292
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:57,719
Guanjun also told me that when the bookstore opens,

293
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,980
A'Yao said that the village committee with get him a wife.

294
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,039
Don't bother the village committee.

295
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,340
Work hard by yourself.

296
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,959
Yang Guanjun is always making fun of me. When did I say that?

297
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,879
Is a partner the reward for doing well?

298
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,279
When the homestay opens, how about sending one over to me?

299
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,400
Fine! How about sending Xia Xia to you?

300
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,419
She's the boss. Why would she settle for Xia Xia?

301
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,679
I don't mind. When the homestay opens, I'll go get him from you.

302
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,040
Okay!

303
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,700
Listen up. You can take him if you like.

304
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,499
Xia Xia, why are you blushing?

305
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,080
- Stop it.
- Xia Xia,

306
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,859
how are you supposed to find a wife if you're so shy?

307
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,320
Right?

308
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
Come on, have some shrimp.

309
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,319
Chuchu, how old are you?

310
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm 24 years old.

311
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,059
That's a great match.

312
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,980
How about Xia Xia?

313
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,560
Xia Xia is a good boy.

314
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,900
Xia Xia, why are you blushing again?

315
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,519
Stop teasing him! What's wrong with you?

316
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,819
Well, come on.

317
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,299
I'd like to propose a toast.

318
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,699
Welcome, Xu Hongdou.

319
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,299
<i>Welcome!</i>

320
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,559
Welcome, Hongdou!

321
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,099
- Sister Hongdou!
- Sister Hongdou!

322
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,419
- Sister!
- Sister Hongdou!

323
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,220
Thank you.

324
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,440
Uncle A'Yao, can we start eating?

325
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,100
Greedy boy!

326
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,059
Yeah, enjoy yourself. We're a family. There's no need to be polite. Eat up.

327
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,339
Okay. Enjoy yourself.

328
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,820
Eat more.

329
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,800
Pork stew.

330
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,340
We have pork stew for dinner tonight.

331
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,960
Hello.

332
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
Mom.

333
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,260
I just took a shower.

334
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,919
<i>What did you have for dinner?</i>

335
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,819
It was a party!

336
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,219
The village aunties joined us.

337
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,639
I even filmed a video. I'll send it to you later.

338
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,679
<i>Sure. Don't forget to send it to me.</i>

339
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,520
By the way, have a look at the bottom of your bag.

340
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,600
What did you put in here?

341
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,019
<i>Reach into the very bottom. Did you find it?</i>

342
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,613
Your bank card?

343
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,039
If I give it to you in person, you'd take it out secretly.

344
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,139
This card has the ¥200,000 you gave me for home renovations.

345
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,679
<i>I also got your dad to add ¥100,000 more to this account.</i>

346
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:23,839
<i>This money was meant for your apartment</i>

347
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,020
or your wedding.

348
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,720
Mom, didn't we talk about this?

349
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,239
Sister bought a house for you guys, so I'll pay for the renovations.

350
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:36,600
Besides, ¥200,000 isn't enough for that.

351
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,779
I have money.

352
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,739
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

353
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,279
But aren't you starting a business venture now?

354
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,659
You'll need money.

355
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,500
You'll feel more confident with money in that account.

356
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
<i>Don't send it back to me.</i>

357
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,140
Keep it.

358
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,059
Hold on to it so you can give us peace of mind.

359
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,800
All right?

360
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,420
Fine.

361
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,700
If I really use this money, I'll treat it as an investment from your two.

362
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,419
When there are profits, you'll receive bonuses.

363
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

364
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,950
You can call the shots.

365
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,559
Well, the pin number is "heavenly spirit spirit earth spirit spirit."
<i>(Sounds like: 300400)</i>

366
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,419
Hold on.

367
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,780
Don't use this combination for everything.

368
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,619
300400? Change it.

369
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:17,760
<i>I'd better not.</i>

370
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,940
I can't remember a new one with my poor memory.

371
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,179
All right, don't stay up too late.

372
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,100
<i>Don't forget to send me the video.</i>

373
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,719
<i>All right! I'm hanging up!</i>

374
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,320
What's wrong?

375
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,680
<i>Let's have rice noodles tomorrow.</i>

376
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,720
Don't wanna.

377
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,760
Why do you sound like that?

378
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,600
Are you crying?

379
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,300
<i>I'm not.</i>

380
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,339
Why are you denying? What's wrong?

381
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm pondering while staring at my bank card.

382
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,019
Did you lose your money?

383
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,720
Was your card stolen?

384
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,120
Did you mom use it to buy a house for your younger brother?

385
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,200
You're the only one with a brother.

386
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

387
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,399
My mom didn't use the money I gave her for home renovations.

388
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:42,320
She saved another ¥100,00 and gave it back.

389
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,660
What do you think? Why can't I return my parents' love?

390
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm such a terrible daughter.

391
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,419
I even complained that they were mopping the floor with shower water.

392
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,720
<i>Hey, dude. Don't you have any sympathy for others?</i>

393
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,480
Sorry. I'll stop laughing.

394
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,759
Nighttime is an emotional hell.

395
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,180
Don't drown in it.

396
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,540
How about I lift your spirits?

397
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,120
How?

398
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,979
I'll tell you some cheesy pick up lines.

399
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,039
The ones where you'll feel disgusted upon hearing.

400
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,520
You can give it a shot.

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,500
If you did, you wouldn't have stumbled into my heart.

404

Keep going.

405
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,400
Can I purchase land from you?

406
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,440
What land?

407
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,920
<i>A plot of land in your heart.</i>

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,440
Of course. Can you help me with a shower?

411
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,820
A shower?

412
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,840
Shower your love on me.

413
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,960
<i>Cheered up?</i>

414
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,760
Not bad.

415
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,880
That's good.

416
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,519
When the sun rises, it'll be a new day.

417
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,280

What about this? I'll make rice noodles at home tomorrow.

420
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,020
Sleep as much as you want. Come over for breakfast when you get up.

421
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm not going over.

422
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,940
Why not?

423
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,480
I'm afraid they'll make fun of me.

424
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,690
Who'll make fun of you?

425
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,519
Fine. Good night. I'm going to bed.

426
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,580
Hold on! Wait!

427
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,880

<i>[Youfeng Cafe]</i>

438
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,660
Before I came over, I drafted a homestay development proposal.

439
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,539
We'll align with the village's development

440
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,879
and invest more efforts in pollutant management.

441
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,900
- We aim to—
- Hold on. I will read this later.

442
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,680
I have one question.

443
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,380
I'm listening.

444
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,800
What is your business management arrangement?

445
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,239
I'm in charge of the homestay's operation and management.

446
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,199
As a manager, I hold 20% of the shares.

447
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,160
The remaining is split between Na Na and I equally.

448
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,419
When the homestay opens, I'll be working at the cafe.

449
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,400
I'll be paid separately as an employee.

450
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,599
My dad told me that it's a curse for friends

451
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,480
to start up a business together.

452
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,919
Once there's a conflict, the business will go down.

453
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,440
The friendship will be shattered as well.

454
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
That won't happen to us.

455
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,739
If your business isn't optimistic or there are issues with funding...

456
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll sell her watch.

457
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,879
Xiao Huang is worried that you're doing it on impulse or are overly optimistic.

458
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:14,319
No, we aren't.

459
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,399
Running a homestay isn't a walk in the park.

460
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,599
It's a path to managing guestrooms, the kitchen, and clogged drains.

461
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,540
I know all of these. Hongdou has elaborated clearly to me.

462
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm also mentally prepared.

463
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,439
No matter how prepared you are,

464
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:38,039
you'll never be sufficiently prepared when facing reality.

465
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,679
There are too many challenges.

466
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,499
If things don't go well,

467
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,700
a homestay will be short-lived.

468
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,179
How short?

469
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,720
There are very few who can beyond survive two years.

470
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,499
To be honest, I've consulted a friend who owns homestays.

471
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:59,059
My current budget is enough for now.

472
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,700
She did the calculations for me as well.

473
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,339
Listen! I've already paid five years of rent.

474
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,300
Moreover, the price is good.

475
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,259
The current rent

476
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,559
is estimated to be less than 30% of annual revenue.

477
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,679
So, there isn't much pressure on us.

478
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,539
Of course,

479
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,199
there might be unforeseeable accidents when we run the place.

480
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,420
However, we should get the ball rolling.

481
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,360
If we're overcautious, we won't get anything done.

482
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,520
It's the same in life.

483
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
Deal with problems as they come.

484
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,080
I share the same opinion.

485
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,959
She's just warning you.

486
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:42,020
You have to be composed and focused.

487
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,220
I bet you're the one who's worried.

488
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,239
I know.

489
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,400
No matter the problem,

490
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,439
Chairman Xie and Xinxin will support us unconditionally.

491
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:58,020
You won't let me face trouble alone, right?

492
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,660
Don't flatter me. I'm not buying it.

493
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,199
I thought you loved this.

494
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,120
Get lost.

495
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,680
Let me pick up this call.

496
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,459
A development proposal? Not bad.

497
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,820
Hello.

498
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,500
Have you guys arrived?

499
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,120
Where are you?

500
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,320
I see.

501
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,119
Wait for us at the intersection.

502
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,539
I'm with Charman Xie at the cafe. We're heading to the village.

503
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,860
Do you want drinks?

504
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,579
Na Na, do you have cold brew tea?

505
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

506
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,040
How many people are there?

507
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,640
Okay, I see.

508
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,400
See you then.

509
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,999
- Old Xie, draft a contract with Mr. Li.
- Sure.

510
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,180
President Xu, please prepare the money.

511
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,739
- President Xu, we'll get going.
- Go ahead.

512
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,720
- Bye-bye.
- I'll read the proposal later.

513
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,640
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

514
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:05,599
- Nice.
- Four cups of cold brew tea.

515
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,080
- Bye-bye!
- We're off!

516
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,399
I'm over the moon!

517
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
The lovely Hongdou and beautiful Na Na

518
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,900
will take over the homestay!

519
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,480
Old Xie,

520
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,039
you got me to tell them how tough this business will be.

521
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,520
Aren't you afraid of scaring them off?

522
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,159
If they give up so easily,

523
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,080
that means they aren't suitable to take over the homestay.

524
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,299
You're worried that they're making an impulsive decision.

525
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,620
Why did you make me the mouthpiece?

526
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,860
I'm not in the position to make criticisms.

527
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,119
You're pretty good at managing your love.

528
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,539
Say that again!

529
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,979
If you don't want to listen to this, make your move.

530
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,679
Why are you so impatient? Haste isn't needed for such matters!

531
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,380
You should hurry up! What else needs haste?

532
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,600
I'm well in control.

533
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,120
Yeah, you're in control.

Do you want to stand in the center?

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,700
But I think it's good to stand at the end.

552
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,939
The center is the best place.

553
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,179
I want to be the best.

554
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,779
You're like me. You sing out of tune, so you may not get it.

555
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:17,120
I know. I've been working hard.

556
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,520
Dad, is it hard to sell your water purifiers?

557
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,859
Someone will buy them.

558
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,680
Dad, you should work hard too.

559
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,300
I will.

560
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,879
By the way, Dad, I'll tell you a secret.

561
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,819
What is it?

562
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,480
You can't be upset.

563
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,980
I won't.

564
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,480
A guy is trying to woo my mom.

565
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,440
A guy?

566
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,519
Here, Xiaochun. Check it.

567
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,220
Don't worry.

568
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,340
I selected your products carefully.

569
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,899
I only deliver the best to you.

570
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,600
Tell me if there are any problems.

571
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,960
Nice, not bad.

572
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
Unload them.

573
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,080
By the way, this is for you.

574
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,619
You can use it to make soup or steep it in water.

575
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,459
You seem very tired lately.

576
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:30,160
Make sure you stay healthy.

577
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,480
Caterpillar fungus?

578
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,059
There's no need to thank me. You can just treat me to a meal.

579
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,200
No, I can't accept this. It's too expensive. I can't afford it.

580
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,899
It's cheap. Take it.

581
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,539
Thank you for your concern. I'll buy you a meal next time.

582
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,439
Today, Xiao Hu Lu's dad is coming to visit here. I have to go home.

583
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:49,100
Aunty Baoping.

584
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,419
A'Hui is following her everywhere.

585
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,480
Keep it down.

586
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,959
Stop following me around. I won't accept this.

587
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,399
I traveled very far to get this for you.

588
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,340
- Take it.
- Bring it home. Give it to your family.

589
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,139
Take it. It's good for your health.

590
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,320
I'll help you. I'll carry it for you.

591
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,320
It's time to eat.

592
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,240
- I'll bring the dishes out.
- No, it's fine.

593
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,699
Take a seat. Xiao Hu Lu, take a break. Clear the table.

594
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:24,880
Let's eat first. Dad will help you pack.

595
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,440
Sure. Wash your hands.

596
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,600
You must be hungry, Luo Quan.

597
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
Mom, I'm not hungry.

598
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,699
You must be starving.

599
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,819
Goodness.

600
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,859
The company has new regulations now.

601
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,259
If we don't clock in or out on time, we can't get the attendance bonus.

602
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:43,699
- You must've been waiting.
- It's fine.

603
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,060
It's nice to watch Xiao Hu Lu practice writing.

604
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,680
Well, take a seat.

605
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,759
What about Xia Xia?

606
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:52,820
Xiaxia doesn't eat at home.

607
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,820
Here you go.

608
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,299
Thank you, Mom.

609
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,240
Pass me her bowl.

610
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,480
How are the sales of water purifiers recently?

611
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,399
Not bad.

612
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:09,440
- Not bad?
- That's good.

613
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,799
How are your parents? Are they well?

614
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:14,059
They're getting by fine.

615
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,779
That's good.

616
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,579
You... should hurry up and eat.

617
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,299
Head back early. It'll be dangerous to drive at night.

618
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:21,820
Okay.

619
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,780
Have you told your parents

620
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,240
about Xiao Hu Lu attending elementary school?

621
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,979
Well... That's not urgent.

622
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,400
You can't be so lax about everything.

623
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,419
Your parents assume Xiao Hu Lu will study in Kunming.

624
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,159
You have to tell them immediately.

625
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,019
You can't leave everything to a later date.

626
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,540
Listen up. I hate this aspect of you the most.

627
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,099
Eat.

628
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,080
I know. I'll tell them when I get back.

629
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,720
- Eat.
- Thank you, Mom.

630
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,199
You must tell them, okay?

631
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,440
I will. Here you go.

632
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,880
- Mom, have some of this.
- I can take it myself.

633
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,919
Stop bothering with others. Eat more meat.

634
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,140
Here.

635
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,760
These are for your parents.

636
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,920
Remember to tell them that Xiao Hu Lu is studying here.

637
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,360
Also... do you have enough money?

638
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,940
We're saving for Xiao Hu Lu's education,

639
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,459
but selling water purifiers isn't a stable job.

640
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,720
If you're struggling, tell me.

641
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,540
I eat at home, so I don't need much money.

642
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,499
I see. Take care of yourself.

643
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:53,660
I won't use any money from Xiao Hu Lu's bank account.

644
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,220
Get going.

645
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,300
Xiaochun.

646
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,300
Cut to the chase.

647
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,620
Are you in a relationship?

648
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,999
Hold on. Why are you asking about this?

649
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,400
Focus on yourself.

650
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,280
Besides, I'll take care of our daughter no matter what happens.

651
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,199
I-I didn't mean that.

652
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,699
One more thing, Luo Quan.

653
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,059
I don't care if you date someone,

654
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,179
but you have to make things clear to your mom. Don't beat around the bush all the time.

655
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,859
She calls my mom whenever she gets anxious, and my mom has to console her.

656
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:32,139
You're an inexplicable guy.

657
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,679
Why can't you call me when there are problems? Why do you call my mom?

658
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,659
What are you guys even thinking?

659
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,620
I want to call you,

660
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,779
but I... I'm afraid of your berating.

661
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,960
When have I done that?

662
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,459
Fine, get going.

663
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,340
Drive carefully.

664
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,380
I'll visit again next month.

665
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,459
You don't have to come over if you're busy.

666
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,240
I'll ask Xiao Hu Lu to visit her grandparents during the holidays.

667
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,160
I'll come next month.

668
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,120
Well, do what you like.

669
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,819
Xiaochun, can't you be more patient with me?

670
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,119
Haven't I been patient with you? Mr. Bow Legs.

671
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,480
Listen to you. You're insulting me again!

672
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,419
Look at yourself! You have bow legs!

673
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,840
I...

674
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,279
Your parents gave you the perfect name.

675
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:30,020
You grew up to fit your name.

676
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,640
All right, enough. Get going.

677
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,020
I'll head off.

678
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,060
I'll come next month.

679
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,020
Xiaochun.

680
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,020
Can you please say everything once?

681
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,459
Take care.

682
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,480
Don't work too hard.

683
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,620
- I'm leaving.
- Get going.

684
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,560
Look at him. How could I have fallen for him in university?

685
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,720
Come on. Be careful. I'll carry it.

686
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,240
Okay.

687
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,940
Take it easy.

688
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,939
Why is there so much soil on them?

689
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,400
Sister Xiaochun, it's impossible to be entirely clean of soil.

690
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,380
- 61. Take note next time.
- Of course.

691
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,479
One, two, three! Come on.

692
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:49,020
Guys! Xiaoyue, bring these in.

693
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,940
In my opinion, A'Hui is a decent guy.

694
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,259
His house is so lavish.

695
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,720
I even heard that he has another house in Xiaguan.

696
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,120
Baoping.

697
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,820
It's fine even if he's a little younger.

698
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,879
You think A'Hui is decent, but Xiaochun doesn't like him.

699
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,999
Xiao Hu Lu's dad visits all the time.

700
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,219
Are they back together now?

701
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,180
Luo Quan doesn't even talk properly.

702
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,200
I realized ages ago.

703
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,460
He's a poor match for Xiaochun.

704
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,099
In what sense?

705
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,019
A short fuse with a silent pot.

706
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:27,219
If both of them have short fuses, their lives would be hell.

707
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,759
- Don't you agree?
- Exactly.

708
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,380
- Yeah.
- That's true.

709
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,340
Good evening.

710
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,059
Hongdou's here.

711
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,360
Aunty A'Gui, you're here too.

712
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,539
I'll just watch television at home.

713
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,979
It's better to hang out with them here.

714
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,419
- I'm helping out too.
- That's nice.

715
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:42,539
Why are you here?

716
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,739
We're packing potatoes for distribution. It's dirty here.

717
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,099
I'm here to help.

718
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,740
What? Do you think I'm a nuisance?

719
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,199
How dare he?

720
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,019
He's dying to meet you.

721
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,219
He's so happy that you're here.

722
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,619
She's here to help. Don't tease her.

723
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,960
Exactly.

724
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,219
A'Yao and Hongdou haven't even made things official,

725
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:06,860
but you're already waiting for a wedding party.

726
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,680
Well, what can I help with?

727
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,560
Sit here.

728
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,979
Stick on the delivery slips with me.

729
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,420
How do I do it?

730
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
I'll teach you. Look.

731
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,219
Stick these labels stating five kilograms on the small boxes.

732
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,980
The labels for ten kilograms go on the large boxes.

733
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,900
I'll take this down.

734
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,380
<i>Okay.</i>

735
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,900
What were you guys chatting about?

736
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,320
We were talking about Xiaochun.

737
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,739
Xiao Hu Lu's dad visits often.

738
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,239
A'Hui, the supplier, likes her too.

739
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,019
Xiaochun doesn't feel anything toward them.

740
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,260
She doesn't care about either one.

741
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,440
When did Xiao Hu Lu's dad come back?

742
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,259
It's their divorce agreement.

743
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,539
He can visit the child once a month.

744
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,200
So, Luo Quan comes over every month.

745
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,939
Why did they get a divorce?

746
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,780
He never came home.

747
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,820
Was he having an affair?

748
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,379
Nope. He's selling water purifiers.

749
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:02,799
Youngsters these days get a divorce after a small bump.

750
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:05,420
Do you know Xiao Bai living in the courtyard?

751
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,940
Her child is already in university, but she still got a divorce.

752
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,539
Hear this. I saw Xiao Bai hanging out with Hu Youyu.

753
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,100
They're at the bar every day.

754
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,899
Why does she see in him?

755
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,259
What does she want from him?

756
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,379
Mr. Hu is a talented musician.

757
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,859
Girls love such charming men.

758
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,619
What kind of charm does he have?

759
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,299
He has such a glib tongue.

760
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,300
I should warn Xiao Bai or she'll be duped.

761
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,659
Stop it.

762
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,680
Don't be so nosy.

763
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,819
You're just prejudiced against Mr. Hu.

764
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,880
He's a nice person.

765
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,219
He just expresses himself in an annoying way,

766
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,779
but he's really loyal.

767
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,240
He's very caring to his friends.

768
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,659
You can't judge a book by its cover.

769
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,240
You should get to know him better.

770
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,119
Are his parents still around?

771
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,399
They are. Even his grandparents are doing well.

772
00:43:56,399 --> 00:44:00,760
Since he's so caring, why doesn't he go home?

773
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,520
You guys shouldn't judge a book by its cover!

774
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,900
Right, Baoping?

775
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,220
Mr. Hu.

776
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,519
Okay. I'll be there right away. Wait for me.

777
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,580
What's going on?

778
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,139
I have to go to the bar.

779
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,300
Mr. Hu is being hustled.

780
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,220
I'm going with you.

781
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,740
Okay, let's go.

782
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,060
Hustled? What does that mean?

783
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,960
