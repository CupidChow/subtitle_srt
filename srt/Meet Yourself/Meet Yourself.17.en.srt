<i>[Episode 17]</i>

3
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Mr. Ma.

4
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
- President Ma.
- Is A'Yao around?

5
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
He's in there. He hasn't gone anywhere.

6
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll leave you guys to your work.

7
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,000
Is he the Taoist and failed businessman who lives in the courtyard?

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
President Ma isn't a monk.

9
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
He must be over 50 years old.

10
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
He's 40 years old, ten years older than me.

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Really?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
He's a typical overbearing boss.

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
He looks old from working too hard.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Let's go.

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
The oranges need to be roasted a little longer.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's have tea first.

17
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,600
- A'Yao.
- Yeah?

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,788
The money you got from Series A funding is far from enough.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
I think it's enough.

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,000
You're venturing into commerce.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They're asking you to contribute a portion

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
so that you'll share the risk.

23
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,800
If this goes on,

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll have to keep selling my apartments.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Do you still have apartments?

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Didn't you sell everything in Beijing

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
to pay off your debts?

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
These are in my hometown.

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,500
In the early years when I made some money,

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,000
I bought two apartments facing each other for my parents in my hometown.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
It was so I would live close to them when I'm back,

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,400
and I can take care of them easily.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,700
They were cheap back then.

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,000
Right now, the prices have gone up significantly.

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
You have to think this through.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
You don't need me to lecture you on investment risks.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,500
You know them better than anyone.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,700
I do.

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
How should I discuss this with my parents

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,900
without causing them distress again?

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,100
Let me think about this.

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,000
You're asking for time to think?

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Look at how bold you were back then!

44
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,600
Your parents spent their lives saving money

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,500
so that you can buy a small apartment in Beijing.

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,400
But what did you do?

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
You didn't even hesitate in taking the money

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
to start a business with your classmates.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,900
Well...

50
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,300
A hero won't mention his past glories.

51
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
At that time,

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,100
I was young and fearless.

53
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,400
Fear didn't exist in my dictionary!

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
My luck was good as well.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
I made money no matter what business I got into.

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,300
I only spoke to my parents after I earned money.

57
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,000
But at that time,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,100
my parents were proud of me.

59
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
All our relatives and neighbors knew about me.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,300
Mr. Ma's son has a big company under his name in Beijing.

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Everyone asked my parents to pull strings

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,800
just so their children could get jobs in my company.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,500
At that time...

64
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
After that,

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
when I was down and out,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
the same folks began to dish the dirt

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,400
and gossip about me.

68
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,200
My parents must've felt horrible hearing all this.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Mr. Ma,

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,500
you've changed so much.

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,800
You've learned how to consider your parents' feelings

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
and even started

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
to look before you leap.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,020
A breathtaking scenery can only be seen at a perilous peak,

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,600
but the high and mighty risk the greatest falls.

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm someone who has fallen from the peak.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
It hurts terribly.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,500
I'm scared now.

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,600
That means you're getting older.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
You used to be so young and reckless.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
If I didn't invest in your business,

82
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
you'd point fingers at me and hurl verbal abuse my way.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
"How can you be an investor

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
with a lack of vision and decisiveness?!"

85
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
Well...

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,200
Don't slap me in the face.

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,300
Leave me some dignity.

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,500
That was in the past.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,600
Who hasn't been young and reckless before, right?

90
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,900
That's the problem of youth.

91
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Hold on.

92
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
Granny, you should put this piece here.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,600
You haven't reached the goal yet.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
My dice shows five.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,700
I didn't move extra steps.

96
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Granny, you got four.

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,900
No, it's five.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,200
You rolled a four.

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
It's five. I don't care.

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,400
My place has reached the goal.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,000
Give me the peanuts.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
We need to keep a close eye on her.

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
Granny has picked up bad tricks.

104
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,400
She learned them from you.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I really made a mistake in the last round.

106
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Hurry up.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
It's just a game.

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
Don't be angry.

109
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,000
One more time.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Goodness.

111
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,462
One, two, three, four. Strike.

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Granny, your plane has been sent back to the start.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Two of your planes have been kicked back to the start.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,900
Granny, you aren't angry, are you?

115
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
I heard someone say earlier,

116
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,000
"It's just a game. Don't be angry."

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Granny, ouch!

118
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,100
It hurts!

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
It's your turn.

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,000
I wrote a song that fits the tastes of Chairman Xie's dad.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
I just completed the melody,

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
but I haven't had time to draft the lyrics.

134

You're the first one I'm playing this for.

Listen to it.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Damn it.

137
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
What the hell am I even doing here?

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,600
I've degenerated.

No.

140
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
I need to calm down.

141
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,800
This won't do.

142
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
I have to work hard.

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Hello!

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
You were diligent for two days.

148
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Why are you seated up here again?

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,800
Your bulging eyes are scaring people off!

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Why are you smiling while looking at me?

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
I've been waiting for you.

152
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Waiting for me?

153
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Why?

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I'd like to ask for your advice.

155
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Not again.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
You're an elite graduate,

157
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
while I'm just an old hag who only went to elementary school.

158
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
What help can I offer you?

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
No, you're wrong.

160
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,700
You possess great wisdom.

161
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,200
Aunty A'Gui, come here.

162
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Please be seated.

163
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
All right.

164
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Since you've extended a kind invitation, I'll offer a listening ear.

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,500
Perhaps I'll come up with a good idea or two for you.

166
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,400
There's no rush. Enjoy a cup of tea first.

167
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,100
Thank you.

168
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,000
Here's the thing.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,300
As you know,

170
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm starting up a business.

171
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
Of course,

172
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,800
this isn't my first business venture.

173
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
My first few business ventures

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,400
were rather smooth and successful.

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I almost reached the peak of my career.

176
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,800
However, in the midst of my final venture,

177
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,300
I failed to predict

178
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
the changes in the market

179
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
and went bankrupt.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,200
After that, I carefully reflected on my previous successes.

181
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,600
I realized that luck played a huge role.

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,200
As you know, nine out of ten business ventures

183
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
are doomed to failure.

184
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,600
The risk of failure far supercedes success.

185
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Those who can make it to the top are the best in the industry.

186
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Well...

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
I do think your past teachings

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
were absolutely right.

189
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,000
I must take my parents into consideration.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
My parents are very old now.

191
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,400
If I fail again in this venture,

192
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,900
it'll be another terrible blow to them.

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,200
Here is where my concern lies.

194
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,900
So, I'd like to hear your valuable opinion.

195
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,800
Should I start a business again?

196
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,300
Mr. Ma,

197
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,000
what you just said is nonsense.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
Didn't you say that you've ventured into a new business?

199
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Since you've already ventured into a new business,

200
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
why are you asking me if you should do it?

201
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Isn't this nonsense?

202
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,500
You're right. I didn't make myself clear.

203
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Let me rephrase my question.

204
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,200
Should I continue this business venture?

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,300
You're asking me whether you should give up halfway.

206
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
Right?

207
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,800
Fine.

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
Even if you give up halfway,

209
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,000
what are your subsequent plans?

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Will you sit here and meditate?

211
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,600
Do you think your current state

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
isn't a terrible blow to your parents?

213
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Meditation is irrelevant to this.

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,300
There's an excellent saying in the Sutra of Tranquility.

215
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
"If one can maintain a tranquil mind,

216
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
even the heavens and earth will reside within them."

217
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't recite the sutra to me.

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Let me ask you this.

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
You may have a tranquil mind,

220
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
but have you thought about your parents?

221
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
They might not chide you, but what's on their minds?

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Won't they feel anguished?

223
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,100
Won't they be distressed?

224
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,600
Listen up.

225
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,000
In my opinion, you might as well strive for your career again.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Strive for something!

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Carve out a respectable life.

228
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Only then will your parents be free of worries

229
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
about you becoming a monk!

230
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,500
When sparing a thought for your parents,

231
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,800
you have to put yourself in their shoes.

232
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Got it?

233
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,600
How can I put myself in their shoes?

234
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
I have two children.

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know this.

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,100
Xiao Xi...

237
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,800
has been close to me since young.

238
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,300
She's always running around me

239
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,500
like a puppy, calling, "Mom! Mom!"

240
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,000
When she was still in school,

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,600
she'd tell me all about happenings in school,

242
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
the lessons she attended,

243
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,900
their hangouts at a friend's house, and all kind of things

244
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,600
every day once she came home.

245
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,700
Dayang is a boy.

246
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,400
He's tactiturn,

247
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
but he'd blabber on once you asked him.

248
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,200
So, their dad and I barely worried about them

249
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,000
when they were young.

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,100
No matter what happened, they wouldn't keep secrets from us.

251
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,000
They definitely wouldn't.

252
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,300
Things are different now.

253
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,700
They've both grown up.

254
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,500
They have their own families and children.

255
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,100
We live so far away from them as well.

256
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,000
We can only call each other if we want to chat.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Every time I call them, I can only ask,

258
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,400
"How have you been?"

259
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,200
"Have you eaten?"

260
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
"How's your work?"

261
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,100
"How's your health?"

262
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,400
"How's the weather?"

263
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
"Are there typhoons?"

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,100
They will only answer,

265
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,900
"We've eaten." "We're fine."

266
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,800
"Our work is going well."

267
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
"We're healthy."

268
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,500
Anyway, we only relate good news, not bad ones.

269
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,200
It's all pleasantries.

270
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Gosh.

271
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,800
That's true.

272
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,500
My parents ask the same thing.

273
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Without these trivial questions,

274
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,200
what else can we talk about?

275
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,900
To be honest,

276
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:35,100
we don't understand their work even if they tell us.

277
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,700
If young couples like them quarrel, their children are ill,

278
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,000
or if they feel depressed,

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
they'll never tell us

280
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
because they don't want us to worry.

281
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,700
We also know that they're stressed,

282
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,800
and it's hard to make money.

283
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
We don't want to add to their burdens.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,800
So, we only tell them everything is great.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Minor problems don't have to be mentioned.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Once, Dayang had a bad cold.

287
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,000
It was so severe that he had to be hospitalized in the ICU.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
We had no clue.

289
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
When it was the Lunar New Year,

290
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
they came back to celebrate.

291
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,900
Xiao Xi spilled the beans.

292
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,434
I was so furious that the New Year was ruined.

293
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,300
Think about it.

294
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
A cold can kill...

295
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,300
or send someone to the ICU.

296
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,200
If something terrible really happened,

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,500
you'd be left with inconsolable regrets.

298
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,400
Mr. Ma,

299
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,300
look at you.

300
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,700
You're so eloquent and logical

301
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,400
when talking sense into others.

302
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Why are you so muddled about your own matters?

303
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,300
Don't shoulder everything on your own.

304
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,700
You need to communicate with your family, especially with your parents.

305
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,600
You need to talk to them.

306
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,400
There should be a sharing of thoughts.

307
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,600
You're not a teapot without a spout that can't speak.

308
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,400
Xiao Xi and Dayang are great

309
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,700
because they're very filial.

310
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,200
Dayang called me the other day to invite his dad and me

311
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
for a two-week trip to Qingdao.

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Dayang's apartment in Qingdao is huge.

313
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
It's been a year since the renovations were completed,

314
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,400
but we haven't even visited once.

315
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
Xiao Xi also said...

316
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,600
♫ <i>What can I do?</i> ♫

317
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,300
♫ <i>Taking mung beans</i> ♫

318
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,000
♫ <i>Mung beans are delicious</i> ♫

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,700
♫ <i>Gingers are fresh</i> ♫

320
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,600
♫ <i>Fresh gingers are spicy</i> ♫

321
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,400
♫ <i>Piling up a tower</i> ♫

322
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
♫ <i>The tower is tall</i> ♫

323
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,000
♫ <i>Slim and elegant</i> ♫

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,800
♫ <i>My baby, time to sleep</i> ♫

325
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Let me ask you a question.

326
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
Guess what materials are used to make the dyes

327
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
in these three dye vats.

328
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,800
I heard they're made of Banlangen.

329
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,900
Bingo.

330
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
These are made from fermenting Banlangen and lime,

331
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,500
so the colors aren't washed off easily.

332
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,700
Look at this craftsman.

333
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,300
He is rubbing the cloth.

334
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
In fact,

335
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,200
he's ensuring the color is uniform, like the cloth behind you.

336
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
The craftsman here

337
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,500
is making a gradient dye.

338
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,600
Look. There are three distinct segments,

339
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,200
and the color gradually gets lighter.

340
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
♫ <i>What can I do?</i> ♫

341
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,000
♫ <i>Taking mung beans</i> ♫

342
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,800
♫ <i>Mung beans are delicious</i> ♫

343
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,500
♫ <i>Gingers are fresh</i> ♫

344
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,400
♫ <i>Fresh gingers are spicy</i> ♫

345
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
♫ <i>Piling up a tower</i> ♫

346
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,000
♫ <i>The tower is tall</i> ♫

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
♫ <i>Slim and elegant</i> ♫

348
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,112
♫ <i>My baby, time to sleep</i> ♫

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
She hid quietly behind the kitchen and said,

350
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
"You jerk. You're the fickle one."

351
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Fabulous.

352
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,100
This is hilarious.

353
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
Look at this.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,100
Yang Guanjun pole dancing with a tree.

355
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,700
Have you ever written a script?

356
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,900
Nope, it's my first time.

357
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,200
It's hard, isn't it?

358
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Not really.

359
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
When I think about how our acquaintances are starring in this,

360
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
I get so inspired.

361
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,000
I have to say, this is really entertaining.

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
Right?

363
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,800
When I watch television,

364
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,600
I always think these scriptwriters are ridiculous.

365
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
Even I can do the same!

366
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Well, is there anything you feel

367
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,900
is lacking in your script?

368
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm 100% satisfied with it so far.

369
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,800
Let me put it this way.

370
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,700
I think my writing is very coherent throughout.

371
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
What do you think?

372
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,600
I think...

373
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,000
this isn't a script.

374
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,800
You're right.

375
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,700
I wrote this script like a novel.

376
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,000
You think this is a novel?

377
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,900
I know a novel needs a plot,

378
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,400
but this is a promotional video.

379
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,800
So, I deliberately added comic scenes to it.

380
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,200
Comic scenes?

381
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,500
For example?

382
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,200
For example...

383
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,590
Weren't you laughing your head off just now?

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
Tell her what you were laughing at.

385
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Over here.

386
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,900
Huang Xinxin was scared by a dog at the seaside.

387
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,000
Xiao Hulu, Tuotuo, Huzi, and Guobao leaped in to protect her.

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,500
The four children didn't defeat the dog.

389
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,400
The five of them ran off crying while chased by the dog.

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,800
This scene of running

391
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,800
will spotlight our village's scenic seaside.

392
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
There's this part as well.

393
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,800
Xu Hongdou rides a bicycle while chortling away in Youfeng Courtyard.

394
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Na Na sprays water at her with the hose for watering flowers.

395
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,400
Xu Hongdou dodges with a dainty smile,

396
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,200
and the radiant sun shines upon a rainbow.

397
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Hongdou, this isn't a comic scene.

398
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,400
This serves to highlight the supreme romance

399
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,200
and friendship between people.

400
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,000
The ending is the most hilarious.

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,100
Xie Zhiyao grabbed a flag from the villagers.

402
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,000
He rides his horse past the sea and mountains.

403
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,800
At the highest point overlooking Yunmiao Village,

404
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,900
he puts down the flag reading, "Welcome to Yunmiao Village."

405
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,500
The audience doesn't know what he grabbed,

406
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,200
so that triggers...

407
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
a form of suspense.

408
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,500
Suspense?

409
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,000
It's way too comical.

410
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Hilarious!

411
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
I laughed so hard, my nose its runny.

412
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
I can't stop laughing.

413
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,500
It's for you.

414
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,100
For me?

415
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
It's so adorable! Thank you.

416
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,880
Thank you!

417
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
I have more!

418
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Damai.

419
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Come here.

420
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,700
Go on.

421
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
Who wrote this script?

422
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,700
It's written by someone you aren't acquainted with.

423
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,200
I admire their courage.

424
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Sister, don't you think there's any merit in it?

425
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,400
Yeah, just a little.

426
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,700
What is it?

427
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,400
I just said it. Such immense courage.

428
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,400
Do you know how to write one?

429
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,500
I don't.

430
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Aren't you a novelist?

431
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,700
Novels are novels.

432
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,500
Scripts are scripts.

433
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,800
These are completely different fields.

434
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Can you step into a different field for once

435
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
and write a script for our promotional video?

436
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
You'll be paid.

437
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,600
I won't do it even if you pay me.

438
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,700
I can't stand the suffering of being a scriptwriter.

439
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Suffering?

440
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,600
What suffering?

441
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,700
People who know shit

442
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,600
will criticize this script

443
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,500
that you spent days and nights slaving over!

444
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Won't you receive criticism as a novelist?

445
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Some readers will criticize my work,

446
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
but there's no middleman to pocket the cost difference.

447
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Well said, Damai.

448
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Nice to meet you.

449
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
My name is Sunzi.

450
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

451
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Thank you.

452
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Please enjoy.

453
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Good morning, Na Na.

454
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Good morning, Sunzi.

455
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
What would you like to eat today?

456
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,600
A pot of white tea and spicy potato with beef patties.

457
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,400
Got it.

458
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Why are you on your own today?

459
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,600
The cafe isn't busy today, so I'm alone.

460
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,700
By the way,

461
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,200
how's the script going along?

462
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
We're still revising it.

463
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,700
- I'll sit inside.
- Sure.

464
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll bring your food to you later.

465
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,500
Granny, good morning.

466
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,700
Junzi, you're here.

467
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,000
Granny, my name is Sunzi.

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Sunzi.

469
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,700
That's right.

470
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
Sunzi.

471
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm heading in.

472
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,500
Sure.

473
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,100
Sunzi.

474
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,600
Junzi.

475
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
Damai.

476
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,800
Morning.

477
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Morning.

478
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
Seaside...

479
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,600
Damai,

480
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,400
what do you think of a scene with children at the seaside

481
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,600
having fun with insect nets?

482
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
Chairman Xie told me they often went to the seaside

483
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
to catch dragonflies when they were young.

484
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
Moreover, there's a tree in the water there.

485
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm sure it'll look gorgeous in a video.

486
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,900
That sounds great.

487
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,700
Thank you for the affirmation.

488
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
However,

489
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,900
won't there be potential safety hazards?

490
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,000
Parents won't even let their children play at the river alone.

491
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Playing near the sea must be even more dangerous.

492
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
This is just my opinion.

493
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Many readers are concerned about such issues.

494
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,000
They'll think you're promoting dangerous acts.

495
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,400
So, we're very careful about this when writing.

496
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
If you have to use this scene,

497
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
I suggest leaving an author's message.

498
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,700
"It's dangerous for children to play by the seaside.

499
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,600
Please do not imitate."

500
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
Something like this.

501
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
That's really strict.

502
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Thanks for the reminder.

503
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,200
Damai, sorry to bother you again.

504
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
A while back,

505
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
I saw someone playing the Longtou Sanxian in the square

506
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
and found it really distinct.

507
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I think we can add some drama here.

508
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
A romance?

509
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,500
Yes.

510
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,600
Don't the people here perform antiphonal singing during the Double Third Festival?

511
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,700
Here's what I have in mind.

512
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,400
Look at this.

513
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,300
Our draft is already quite loaded,

514
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,838
but look over here.

515
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,800
We can add something more...

516
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,450
<i>Hello?</i>

517
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,950
<i>Hello?</i>

518
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,836
<i>Villagers of Yunmiao. Attention, please!</i>

519
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:49,040
<i>We'll be shooting a promotional video soon, so we need extras.</i>

520
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,940
<i>Sign up if you can sing or dance!</i>

521
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,270
<i>It's a great opportunity to showcase your charms!</i>

522
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,731
<i>Join us! Apply at the village committee office!</i>

523
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,880
<i>[Huang Xinxin]</i>
Make a turn right where you are.

524
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,300
<i>[Xie Zhiyao]</i>

525
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,664
Excellent!

526
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,000
You have great potential.

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,576
Come on, tell us your dream.

528
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,660
Xiao Huang,

529
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,420
don't be like this.

530
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,340
You're scaring me.

531
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,380
<i>[Xie Zhiyao, Zhang Xinrui, Huang Xinxin]</i>
We've waited for two hours, but why isn't there a single soul?

532
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,004
Where is everyone?

533
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:29,428
Maybe they're busy.

534
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,960
There's no rush.

535
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,400
We can clear the scenery shots first.

536
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,730
It's a beautiful day today.

537
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,630
We can film the sunset in the evening.

538
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,188
It's noon anyway.

539
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:46,228
How about having lunch first?

540
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:48,100
Okay.

541
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,750
Sure.

542
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,900
Galsang Flower Restaurant. My treat.

543
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Let's go.

544
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,580
Xinxin.

545
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,558
Candy!

546
00:31:58,558 --> 00:31:59,580
Can I sign up?

547
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,720
Absolutely!

548
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,580
How about a few more people?

549
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,860
No problem. Come in.

550
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,208
Come inside.

551
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,860
Hello.

552
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,256
These are my friends.

553
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,580
Hello.

554
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,311
Sunzi went to shoot the sunset on the mountains with her assistant.

555
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:31,630
They're probably stranded in the rain.

556
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm worried their equipment will be damaged by the rain.

557
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,036
That's expensive.

558
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
The equipment is fine.

559
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,580
They came back when they saw dark clouds.

560
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,940
They're at Huang Xinxin's home right now.

561
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
Did Junzi tell you this?

562
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,440
Sunzi.

563
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,270
Sorry.

564
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,970
Sunzi.

565
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,380
Since when were you so chummy with Sunzi?

566
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,280
Sunzi asked me to help her come up with ideas.

567
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:00,390
Why are you so obliging?

568
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,854
I was lured into the cage by her

569
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:07,636
and got involved somehow.

570
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:10,140
What do you mean by "lured into the cage"?

571
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,440
I was led by the nose.

572
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,490
Sunzi speaks in a really affable manner,

573
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,850
so you'll happily be led by the nose.

574
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,620
Hey, Uncle Qingze.

575
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,710
Don't worry. I'll be right over.

576
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,781
Okay. Bye.

577
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:46,480
What's wrong?

578
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,680
The foal ran off.

579
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,110
The one you witnessed the birth of.

580
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,440
I need to look for it.

581
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,960
- I'll go with you.
- Don't come with me. It's raining. Stay here.

582
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,890
Lend me an umbrella.

583
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,920
The umbrella is useless.

584
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,740
Put on my raincoat.

585
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,710
It followed the other horses into another stable.

586
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,860
I searched, but the other horses shielded it from view.

587
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,600
So, I didn't see it.

588
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,710
I shouldn't have called you before confirming.

589
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,570
All is well as long as you found it.

590
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,750
Yes, you're right.

591
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,950
You must be freezing.

592
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,280
I... I lit a fire in my office.

593
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,510
Warm yourselves up and drink some warm water.

594
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,730
Don't catch a cold. Hurry up.

595
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,080
- Okay.
- It's fine.

596
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,830
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

597
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,223
I'll take you upstairs to dry your hair first.

598
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,190
The foal didn't go missing,

599
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,374
but we almost lost you.

600
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,670
I told you not to wander too far.

601
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,110
Why did you lend the raincoat to someone else?

602
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,486
The tourists had a child with them.

603
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:00,820
They were stranded there.

604
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,480
Why did you give the umbrella to them, too?

605
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,180
There were two children.

606
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,960
Goodness.

607
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,380
Go closer. Dry yourself first. Don't catch a cold.

608
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,670
Why is it pouring out of the blue?

609
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,166
It's good to have rain.

610
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,214
Mushrooms grow after the rain.

611
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,200
Don't you like to eat mushrooms?

612
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,840
You must be hungry.

613
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,190
Here, have some roasted sweet potatoes.

614
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,871
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Uncle Zeqing.

615
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,450
Don't be a stranger.

616
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,780
- Have it before it turns cold.
- Okay.

617
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,630
It's hot!

618
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,460
Take it easy.

619
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,260
It just came out of the oven.

620
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,144
Half have of it first.

621
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,040
Why aren't you eating?

622
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,700
Thank you.

623
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
You're welcome.

624
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,130
Usually, I'm the one who takes care of others.

625
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,730
Are you touched?

626
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,184
Not to that extent.

627
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:12,180
When I take care of others, they aren't particularly touched.

628
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,400
At most, I'm thankful.

629
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,998
Isn't it normal to say you're touched at such a time?

630
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,034
Were you expecting an answer before asking me?

631
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
Fine, I'm touched.

632
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,820
I wouldn't dare to feel otherwise.

633
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,860
You're so... Why are you like this?

634
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,461
What a glib talker. What taught you to be this way?

635
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,240
I learned from you.

636
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,900
When have I been like this?

637
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,260
You've always been like this.

638
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,710
I'm not making false accusations.

639
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,510
Granny said

640
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,340
when you were in junior high school, you started inviting girls home for meals.

641
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,410
Granny is blabbering nonsense.

642
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,660
When did I invite a girl home for meals?

643
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,524
She said the girl ate at your home for over a month.

644
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,960
This is triggering some memories.

645
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,130
She was a classmate sitting in front of me.

646
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,070
At that time, her parents went downtown for surgery.

647
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,550
She was left alone at home.

648
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,686
So, I brought her to my house for meals.

649
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,450
How kind-hearted.

650
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,771
Of course. I used to be the vice monitor of our class.

651
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,030
Such a prestigious title.

652
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,400
No doubt about that.

653
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,900
What about you?

654
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,050
I was our English teacher's assistant.

655
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,440
I'm not asking about that.

656
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,660
I'm curious, did you bring boys home for meals?

657
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,200
Surely not.

658
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,840
If I brought a boy home for a meal,

659
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,020
my mom would've crippled me.

660
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,070
I'm not talking about your schooling days.

661
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,938
Did you bring your dearest person home for meals?

662
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,190
Yes.

663
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,000
When my grandma passed away,

664
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,030
they applied for leave to accompany me home.

665
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,920
They were a great help,

666
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,960
so my family is very fond of them.

667
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,600
They're someone

668
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,658
who is extremely likable.

669
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,130
Is that person that amazing?

670
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,630
Of course.

671
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,286
Couldn't be better.

672
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,070
A few words isn't enough to describe them.

673
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,770
I need to

674
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,520
start from our first days in university.

675
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,030
You attended the same university?

676
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,590
Doesn't that mean you've known each other for more than a decade?

677
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,522
Chen Nanxing and I were classmates at university.

678
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:25,320
Chen... what?

679
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,300
Chen Nanxing.

680
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,900
C-H-E-N, Chen.

681
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,880
"Xing" for "North Star".
<i>("Xing" means "star" in Mandarin)</i>

682
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,856
A one and only star.

683
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,772
A one and only star?

684
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:38,876
Let go of the past.

685
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,930
I'm close to moving on completely.

686
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,460
Look at me.

687
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,920
I can even chat about them with you while eating sweet potatoes.

688
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
I couldn't do this before.

689
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,120
It's like...

690
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,398
a cactus thorn in your flesh.

691
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,580
It doesn't disrupt your daily life,

692
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,480
but it has a strong presence.

693
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,346
It'll remind you of its existence

694
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:17,240
no matter... what you do.

695
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,140
Do you know what this feels like?

696
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,600
I guess I understand

697
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,190
after your analogy.

698
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,282
Once, I went to pick cactus fruit.

699
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,572
A thorn was stuck in my palm.

700
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,480
Whenever I touched it, it hurt.

701
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Somehow, I just couldn't get it out.

702
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,780
In the end,

703
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,660
such wounds will recover.

704
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,510
Alternatively, the wound will be inflamed

705
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,590
or suddenly vanish before you realize it.

706
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,116
Sometimes,

707
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,160
I think it's good to leave it there.

708
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,864
I understand your reluctance to part.

709
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,150
However,

710
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
there are many instances

711
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,610
beyond our own personal control,

712
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,780
let alone the matters of others.

713
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,792
In fact, people around us come and go.

714
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:38,294
Most of the people you meet can only go a short way with you.

715
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,068
They'll keep leaving as you walk on.

716
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,250
Isn't this what life is like?

717
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,024
The rain is never-ending.

718
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,740
♫ <i>I've been alone</i> ♫

719
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,300
♫ <i>Into the unknown</i> ♫
