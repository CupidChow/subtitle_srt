He clearly sent you a phishing site.

4
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,250
The police said the same thing.

5
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,410
They told me to wait for further news.

6
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,179
How could he send me a phishing site

7
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,350
and butcher me?

8
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,189
They even said I'm lucky since I didn't lose much. How is ¥30,000 not much?

9
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,690
Stop talking and eat.

10
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,060
Have you been starving for days?

11
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,880
I ate on the plane.

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,850
The noodles and rice were equally gross.

13
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,230
If they suck, why did you eat two portions?

14
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,999
- Wipe your mouth.
- Okay.

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,910
Anyway, don't let my mom know about this.

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,450
She's frugal.

17
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,910
This will keep her up at night with agony.

18
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,910
You can't let my sister know about this either.

19
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,090
She already despises me.

20
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,509
She'll mock me for life over such a mistake.

21
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,369
You're letting your imagination run wild.

22
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,900
Your sister won't behave like that.

23
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,280
Only you think she's nice.

24
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,110
Anyway, I'll lend you some money for now.

25
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,550
However, be prepared for bad news.

26
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,980
It takes time to recover money

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,160
from online phishing scams.

28
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,910
I know.

29
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,720
Do you also think I'm a fool?

30
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,170
You're not a fool.

31
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,119
You're just easily taken in by easy money.

32
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm greedy.

33
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,069
Why not explore Shanghai for a few days?

34
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,040
I'll pay for your trip.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,289
I won't go.

36

I'll stay here briefly and return when the Shanghai delicacies are delivered here.

37

He had a really tough time.

38
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,909
When he first came back, not a single person helped him.

39
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,510
At that time, Xiaochun hadn't returned yet.

40
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,099
His dad couldn't offer him a single cent.

41
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,209
Instead, he was a deadweight who berated him endlessly.

42
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,909
Aunty, the tofu is ready.

43
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,410
Thank you.

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,379
- Hongdou, this is for you.
- For me?

45
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,230
Thank you, Granny.

46
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,660
Why did his dad berate him?

47
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,149
His dad probably reckoned it took great effort to nurture an outstanding son,

48
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,869
but his son ended up back here.

49
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,890
He didn't approve.

50
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,500
In the past,

51
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,450
a villager's web store failed.

52
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,620
A'Yao took it over.

53
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,139
After that, someone set up an inn.

54
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,989
It's the place you're living in now.

55
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,949
It also failed, and A'Yao again took that place over.

56
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,919
Even the tie-dye workshop he took over

57
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,940
was someone else's failed business.

58
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,620
Why are there so few tourists here?

59
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,350
No one came to browse after so long.

60
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,460
Be patient.

61
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,679
We've already been sitting here for two hours.

62
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,620
It's just two hours.

63
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,790
Is business always like this?

64
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,329
If it's market day, there'll be more people stopping by.

65
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,550
How much can you earn?

66
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,230
I can't make that much either.

67
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,350
Well, are there profits?

68
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,660
It's enough for oil, salt,

69
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,010
and snacks for the children.

70
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,039
As long as I can still work,

71
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,379
I shouldn't ask the younger ones to provide me with everything.

72
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,230
That's embarrassing.

73
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,549
Lately, I've saved more money.

74
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:55,000
A'Yuan can use it as pocket money at school.

75

I'm also saving money for A'Yao.

Why are you saving money for him?

81
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,280
It's for his marriage.

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,629
I started saving money for him the moment he entered college.

83
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,749
I've saved this money for years.

00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,030
- To find—
- For hotpot.

169
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,089
I'm heading to the Old Town, too. Hop in.

170
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,389
Please give us a lift.

171
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:15,790
Come on.

172
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,690
Granny, be careful.

173
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,799
Fasten your seat belt. Come on.

174
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,590
Let me help you.

175
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,270
Sit tight.

176
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,599
How about tying up your hair?

177
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,699
I don't have a hair tie with me.

178
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,760
You can use the one in my bag.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,140
Okay.

180
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,270
- Did you rent this car?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,839
I seldom drive, so I rent one when I need it.

182
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,120
Why are you going to the Old Town?

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,130
For an errand. An important one.

184
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,090
You look like you're ready to beat someone up.

185
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,170
Did your husband come here again?

186
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,609
Granny! He's my ex-husband. We're divorced.

187
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,049
Besides, he's not the one I'm beating up. Don't worry.

188
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,230
If he was the target, I'd take you with me.

189
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,999
Why are you eating hotpot at the Old Town? Don't we have a restaurant in our town?

190
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,189
That restaurant has excellent reviews.

191
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,869
Granny saved up ¥300 and wants to treat me to a meal.

192
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,700
- Right, Granny?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,839
Granny, you're playing favorites.

194
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,920
Why didn't you invite me along?

195
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,049
Aren't you going to wallop your husband?

196
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,459
He's my ex-husband. I've ditched him.

197
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,949
Well, why are you upset?

198
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,650
Fine, I'm over the moon.

199
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,099
How do I remove this?

200
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:58,029
Granny, you can't remove your seat belt.

201
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,519
It's really constricting.

202
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,979
You can't remove it even if it's uncomfortable.

203
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:04,160
It's a ¥200 fine if the police catches us.

204
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,240
Granny?

205
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,720
No way.

206
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,739
All right.

207
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,780
Here we are.

208
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,100
Granny, let me help you with the seat belt.

209
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Feeling better now?

210
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,949
Thanks, Xiaochun.

211
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,219
Shall I pick you up later?

212
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:40,700
There's no need. We can head back by taxi.

213
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
Okay.

214
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,420
- I'm off.
- Thank you.

215
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,240
- Bye-bye.
- Go.

216
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,019
Where is it? Up ahead.

217
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,600
This way.

218
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,960
How much is this?

219
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,690
This is ¥15.

220
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,979
How about a discount?

221
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:04,990
Granny, this is the lowest I can charge.

222
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,949
¥10.

223
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:06,949
¥13.

224
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,099
¥10.

225
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,600
¥12. It's the lowest price possible.

226
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,619
¥9.

227
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,130
Fine, ¥10.

228
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,570
Granny, I've paid for it. Let's go.

229
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,099
I'll give you the money.

230
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,520
It's a gift for you. Let's go.

231
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,900
Hold on.

232
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,019
Hello, Chairman Xie.

233
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,330
We're looking for A'Yuan.

234
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,579
Granny, that's A'Yao.

235
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,400
Ignore him.

236
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
Okay.

237
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,750
Doomed! Doomed!

238
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,269
<i>Welcome!</i>

239
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,650
- A table of two?
- Excuse me.

240
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,219
Does Xie Zhiyuan work here?

241
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,619
Xie Zhiyuan?

242
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,630
Yes, he's around 16 or 17 years old.

243
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,999
- Welcome!
- Is he the one?

244
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,090
Granny!

245
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:16,190
<i>[This segment features special effects for the drama. Please do not attempt similar stunts.]</i>

246
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,569
- How dare you run away from home!
- Don't hit me!

247
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,920
- Granny!
- Come home!

248
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,820
Ouch! Granny!

249
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,620
Granny! Granny, stop!

250
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,050
Granny! Violence is bad!

251
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,550
Granny, stop!

252
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,089
How much is a catty of cow's milk cheese?

253
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,420
¥55 per catty.. You can have a taste.

254
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,590
- They're homemade.
- No, thanks.

255
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,140
<i>[Cow's Milk Cheese, ¥55/catty]</i>

256
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,259
Granny, your dishes are ready.

257
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,199
Xiao Liang, I haven't seen you in ages.

258
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,870
Didn't you go to Ruili with your mom?

259
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,499
I couldn't get used to living at my mom's place,

260
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:19,460
so I came back.

261
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,640
Let's eat together.

262
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,429
Thanks, Granny.

263
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:28,200
I still have to work.

264
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,299
Here's the ladle.

265
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,949
I won't hit you.

266
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,459
Let's eat.

267
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:43,730
Even if the sky collapses, we must fill our stomachs.

268
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,049
When your dad called me

269
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,909
and told me he was sending you over,

270
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:58,000
I already planned to spank you until you went home.

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,159
His dad said I know nothing about raising children.

272
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,500
Spanking children no longer works.

273
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,230
We should wait for him to become sensible.

274
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,349
That's right.

275
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:10,330
Granny, there's an International Spank Out Day.

276
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,350
What day?

277
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,949
It's similar to Children's Day.

278
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:18,000
On that day, parents can't spank their children.

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,699
That's not today, right?

280
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,850
I can spank him on any other day, can't I?

281
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,949
Why can't I spank him?

282
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,389
He needs a spanking.

283
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,019
He's spoiled and does as he pleases.

284
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,120
I can't spank him when he doesn't go to school.

285
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,149
In the end, he ran away from home.

286
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,949
If I don't spank him, he'll become a thief

287
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,829
just like Xie Qiang.

288
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,430
Granny!

289
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,200
Fine, I'll stop.

290
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
Eat up.

291
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,259
Thank you, Granny.

292
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,640
Granny, I'll return to work.

293
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,090
Why should a student be working?

294
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,109
Come home with me later.

295
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,730
I'll ask your dad to pick you up.

296
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,109
Granny.

297
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:20,219
I have to work two more days this week to receive my salary.

298
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,330
Go and work.

299
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,620
Make sure you comb your hair first.

300
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,530
I'm off, Granny.

301
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Why are you letting him work?

302
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,549
He earns a weekly salary here.

303
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,539
He's worked for five days, and two days more isn't much.

304
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,289
Let him finish it.

305
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,979
You should've told me where he was.

306
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,529
I know you like the back of my hand.

307
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,229
If I told you, you would've charged here and ruined my plans.

308
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,720
When did you find out about his whereabouts?

309
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,860
I found out the moment he entered this place.

310
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,500
I have an informant.

311

<i>Seldom?</i>

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,670

00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,430
<i>I might as well return here and work.</i>

333
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,629
<i>Why did A'Yuan go to you?</i>

334
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:31,979
<i>We often play video games with Brother Xia Xia.</i>

335
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,979
<i>He came to me out of the blue and asked for a job.</i>

336
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:36,850
<i>So, you've gathered to fool around</i>

337
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,300
<i>and sing hand in hand?</i>

338
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,109
<i>Brother, why don't you take him back?</i>

339
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,629
<i>He's never suffered much.</i>

340
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,389
<i>It's tiring to work in a hotpot restaurant.</i>

341
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,630
<i>I'm not taking him with me.</i>

342
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,900
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

343
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,299
<i>Get him a job.</i>

344
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:52,589
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

345
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,090
<i>- Every night, report his work performance to me by phone.
- Huh?</i>

346
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,250
<i>Why are you whining?</i>

347
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,589
<i>You're making me betray my friend.</i>

348
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,640
<i>I'm not such a man.</i>

349
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,410
<i>Will you betray him</i>

350
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,910
<i>or betray me?</i>

351
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,080
<i>Make a choice.</i>

352
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,160
<i>I'll betray him.</i>

353
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,260
<i>That's more like it.</i>

354
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,019
<i>Anyway, this isn't a betrayal.</i>

355
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,200
<i>I'm doing this for his benefit.</i>

356
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,670
<i>Brother Liang!</i>

357
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,259
<i>Why does he shit so quickly?</i>

358
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,949
<i>He has a good digestive system. Go back.</i>

359
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,560
<i>Hold on.</i>

360
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,540
<i>Brother Liang!</i>

361
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
<i>Brother Liang!</i>

362
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,900
<i>Take it.</i>

363
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,430
<i>Treat yourself to something nice.</i>

364
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,850
<i>Don't buy cigarettes.</i>

365
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,610
<i>Thank you, Brother.</i>

366
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,730
<i>I'll get going.</i>

367
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,970
<i>Brother Liang! Brother Liang!</i>

368
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,180
<i>Brother Liang, why did you wander so far away?</i>

369
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,590
<i>It stinks like hell there.</i>

370
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,699
<i>I ate too much.</i>

371
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,989
<i>- Let's go back.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

372
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
You even had him on GPS tracking?

373
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
I don't have to do that.

374
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
He's using my old phone.

375
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,000
All the accounts on it are mine.

376
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,600
He's too uneducated to know about such things.

377
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
That's the same as GPS tracking.

378
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,800
My dad left him here, and he's like a wild horse.

379
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,000
I can't keep an eye on him without modern technology.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
Well, why didn't you say a word?

381
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,400
You're the talk of the village.

382
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
You can't keep secrets in the village.

383
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
I have to keep my mouth shut if I don't want others to know.

384
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Besides, he has his own informant.

385
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Xia Xia pouts his chin whenever he lies.

386
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,500
"Brother, I know nothing."

387
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,600
It's obvious that he's lying.

388
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,900
You can't even tell me, right?

389
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,600
You're the number one suspect in leaking secrets.

390
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
I didn't even tell Granny.

391
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,800
However, I told Aunty Feng.

392
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
She's tight-lipped.

393
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,900
He told me he found A'Yuan, but he's conducting reform through labor.

394
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,800
He told me not to worry.

395
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Look. That's why I don't wany Granny intervening.

396
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
If Granny were 20 years old,

397
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
she could win the Women's Chinese Kickboxing Championship.

398
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,599
I'll tell you this. When Grandpa was younger,

399
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,079
Granny nabbed him for his great singing voice.

400
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,079
- She nabbed him and brought him home?
- Yes.

401
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,000
My grandpa was a popular lad.

402
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Granny might not have gorgeous looks,

403
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,200
but she was a robust woman.

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,800
Do you think I can't beat you up?

405
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes, you're pretty. You're the most beautiful.

406
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Don't listen to his nonsense.

407
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,700
He must be talking rubbish.

408
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,000
I bet you were a gorgeous young lady.

409
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,500
You're the gorgeous one.

410
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,400
Stop flattering each other.

411
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Flattering?

412
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,400
Everything he says sounds so foul.

413
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah, this isn't flattery.

414
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,800
This is mutual appreciation between women.

415
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,400
Ignore him. Let's eat.

416
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, let's take a photo as a keepsake.

417
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
Come on. Chairman Xie.

418
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Granny, look over here.

419
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
A peace sign is so corny.

420
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Here's a heart.

421
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
A heart is corny.

422
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,000
Did I close my eyes?

423
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
It's pretty nice.

424
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Let me see.

425
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,400
Have some more food.

426
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Granny, you're giving her all the meat. I just put them in.

427
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You can just add more.

428
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,900
That's enough. Eat more.

429
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,200
Thank you.

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
That's all.

431
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,700
Say something.

432
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,600
What am I supposed to say?

433
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,100
You can scold me if you want to. Don't hold it in.

434
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,000
I've never restrained myself from scolding you.

435
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
How about this?

436
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,700
Keep this a secret from Mom at all costs.

437
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,400
She's so frugal.

438
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,600
Even a few cents for groceries matters so much to her.

439
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,700
If she finds out you were cheated of such a hefty sum, she'll keep silent

440
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,900
but toss and turn every night.

441
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
As for money,

442
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
don't borrow from our brother.

443
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I have some savings to make up for the ¥30,000.

444
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,100
It's best if we can recover the money from the phishing scam.

445
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,800
Even if that money is lost, wipe it from your mind.

446
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Take this as a lesson learned. Leave this matter in the past.

447
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Brother won't mention a word about this.

448
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
None of us should mention it either.

449
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
Why are you staring at me?

450
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
Aren't you going to scold me?

451
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
I've scolded you loads! You just don't listen to a word I say.

452
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,500
You should know your own intellect.

453
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,400
They stopped you from telling your family to avoid being seen through.

454
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you really think it's that easy to earn money?

455
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
I have another question for you.

456
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,800
Have Mom and I ever asked you for a single cent?

457
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,300
Why are you so desperate?

458
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,400
Is the world out there so rosy? Is staying at home so terrible?

459
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Do you think I'm snapping at you again?

460
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't hate staying at home.

461
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,400
I just want to make more money.

462
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,800
The wood carving workshop doesn't profit much.

463
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
One person makes a huge difference.

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,800
Master can pay less minimum wage.

465
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,800
Brother came back to start a business.

466
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,200
You quit your job in Kunming and came home.

467
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,000
In the past few years, he invested a lot of money here.

468
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,200
He hires so many people and distributes tons of wages.

469
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Yet, there are so few tourists.

470
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,600
Selling produce online only makes a small profit. He's barely making ends meet.

471
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
You can't get any bonuses either.

472
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Why are you worrying about this?

473
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm the only man in the family, aren't I?

474
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
I should support the family in the future.

475
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
We can't just rely on you.

476
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Do you think I'm dumb for thinking too much?

477
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
- I know I'm stupid.
- You are stupid.

478
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,500
Do you know what it means

479
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,800
to wear one's learning lightly?

480
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
How about the saying, "Success follows when the time is ripe"?

481
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,800
If there's water in a river, we have to start by digging ditches.

482
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Only then can the water be drawn to the ground.

483
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,200
Many things need to be done step-by-step.

484
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,900
Haste won't get us anywhere.

485
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,700
Mrs. Huailan has been an embroiderer all her life.

486
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,400
Right now, everyone treats her with respect

487
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,800
and calls her Master Xie.

488
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,700
When you were learning wood carving from your master,

489
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,600
you studied during the day and practiced at night.

490
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,800
You put in so much effort for so many years.

491
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,000
You finally carved a worthless old wooden basin

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,200
into a piece of handicraft and sold it.

493
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Oftentimes, you can't focus on immediate gratification.

494
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,300
It takes time to develop,

495
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,000
but that's not necessarily obvious to the eye.

496
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,600
You're always so impatient. Well, doesn't that make you a fool?

497
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
Master hasn't even earned much after a lifetime of work.

498
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,400
Tell me. How much is a windfall?

499
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,400
Your master keeps his family fed with his own skills.

500
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
He also passes these skills on

501
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,500
so that his apprentices can also support their own families.

502
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,400
Isn't that enough?

503
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,500
- The internet said—
- Stop listening to the ramblings of others.

504
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,100
Can't you think for yourself?

505
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
I can only say the same thing. Do you think it's that easy to earn money?

506
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
When encountering problems,

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,600
we should think about how to sell our best items.

508
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
All you do is flee.

509
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,500
Xie Xiaoxia, listen up. Do you know what we call your behavior?

510
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,000
Gluttonous, lazy, overambitious, and indolent.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,600
You'll be a failure in life.

512
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
Fine, I'll stop my nagging.

513
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Contemplate on your own.

514
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
I got it.

515
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
You got it?

516
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
Can I have a taste?

517
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Of course. It's homemade. Have a taste.

518
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,400
Here you go.

519
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,100
- Try it.
- Thank you.

520
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,000
How much are they?

521
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,400
- ¥55 per catty.
- ¥55?

522
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
- Would you like some?
- How much is a package?

523
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
Let me weigh it.

524
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,700
Give it to me. Get a bag.

525
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
It weighs 1.35 catty.

526
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
That's ¥71.50 in total.

527
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll charge you ¥70 for it.

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

529
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,800
I'll pay you through WeChat.

530
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,300
The QR code.

531
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,600
- All done. Here you go.
- Thank you.

532
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,100
You're welcome.

533
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Do you want your brother to pick you up

534
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
or go home on your own in a few days?

535
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,100
I'll go back on my own.

536
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,700
What did your dad say to you on the phone?

537
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,700
He'll ask a driver in the village to take me home next week.

538
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Did I hit you hard?

539
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,800
It's fine, Granny. Don't stare at it.

540
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
They're just from washing dishes.

541
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,900
I'm fine.

542
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,300
A'Yuan, you should study hard and get educated.

543
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:37,000
Otherwise, life will hit you much harder than my beatings.

544
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,800
Granny. Let's go.

545
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Okay.

546
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,200
Get on with your work.

547
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,900
- They're paying you a salary, so don't slack off.
- Got it.

548
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,000
A'Yuan, I really didn't leak a word about your incident.

549
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,500
Trust me.

550
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,900
Fine, whatever you say.

551
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,200
What's with your attitude?

552
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Since I trust you, why does my attitude matter?

553
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Enough with this. I've already thought things through.

554
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,600
You barely know a few people.

555
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,200
Don't pick at old wounds.

556
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Granny, look at him!

557
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
You can't hit me!

558
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
- Let's go.
- We're off.

559
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Granny, take care.

560
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,600
Granny, this way.

561
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
I have to leave. Some cocoons are arriving at the embroidery workshop this afternoon.

562
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Is the food enough? Shall I buy you milk tea?

563
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm full.

564
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,200
Listen up.

565
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Make sure you keep this a secret when you go home.

566
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,700
Got it?

567
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,900
Dump this for me. I'm leaving.

568
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
Sister.

569
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
What?

570
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm sorry, Sister.

571
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,300
What are you doing? You're making me hurl.

572
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,400
The best thing you can do is stop making me flare up.

573
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Okay.

574
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,400
- I'm off.
- Bye-bye.

575
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,600
How could I say he's making me hurl?

576
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,000
Why did that even leave my mouth?

577
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
What's wrong with me...

578
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,700
Why did I hug her?

579
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,500
I really want to die.

580
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,600
<i>This is Erhai Lake.</i>

581
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,000
<i>The afternoon sun shines on the water's surface, making the lake sparkle.</i>

582
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>Cang Mountain is in the distance.</i>

583
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,400
How magnificent!

584
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
There's a little snow on the mountain,

585
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,800
but it's not clear in the video.

586
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,300
This is an exact replica of my elementary school composition.

587
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
This is our landlord, Xie Zhiyao.

588
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
He's... so-so.

589
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Just so-so?

590
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,300
Let me introduce myself.

591
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm Xie Zhiyao.

592
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm handsome, suave, and free-spirited.

593
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,500
I'm tall, stately, and strong.

594
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm the village beau.

595
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
That's too lame. I'm moving on.

596
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,700
Lame? I'm not done yet.

597
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,200
This is our extremely cool Granny Xie.

598
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
She is kind,

599
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,600
beautiful, and a great fighter.

600
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
I don't hit people.

601
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,400
That's so uncivilized.

602
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,600
When we were at the hotpot restaurant,

603
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,800
she spanked a rebellious boy who played truant

604
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,600
and ran away from home.

605
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
It's really windy now. We're on our way back.

606
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,100
Xu Hongdou, who are you sending this video to?

607
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,400
- My family chat.
- What?!

608
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
I was kidding earlier.

609
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,500
Xu Hongdou! Take a new video, and I'll introduce myself again.

610
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,000
<i>Just so-so?</i>

611
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>Let me introduce myself.</i>

612
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
<i>I'm Xie Zhiyao.</i>

613
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,400
<i>I'm handsome, suave, and free-spirited.</i>

614
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
<i>I'm tall, stately, and strong.</i>

615
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,400
<i>I'm the village beau.</i>

616
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
<i>That's too lame. I'm moving on.</i>

617
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
<i>Lame? I'm not done yet.</i>

618
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,100
Who the heck is he?

619
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,000
The fun is getting to their heads.

620
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
Look at how happy she is.

621
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm worried they can't find their way back to the hotel.

622
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,600
That's good.

623
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Youngsters shouldn't flop on the sofa all day long

624
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,000
and scroll on their phones. Right?

625
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,400
They're either laughing like fools

626
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
or boiling with anger.

627
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,700
That's abnormal.

628
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,000
This is much better.

629
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,700
<i>Xu Hongdou, who are you sending this video to?</i>

630
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,300
<i>- My family chat.
- What?!</i>

631
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
This boy is so sprightly.

632
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,100
Of course. He's the village beau.

633
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,400
Look at his white teeth.

634
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,900
My teeth are also white.

635
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,400
You can't compare to him.

636
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Why are you vying for attention?

637
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,100
Let's watch it again.

638
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,950
♫ <i>The sun will rise and fall</i> ♫

639
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
♫ <i>It's just another day</i> ♫

640
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,000
Can you tell?

641
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,700
What are we supposed to know?

642
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,500
It's a website.

643
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,000
- It's a phishing site.
- Phishing?

644
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,700
Is that a new game?

645
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,600
Are you addicted to Puzzle Bobble?

646
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
Phishing sites are scams.

647
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,200
I thought it was a game like Fishing Master.

648
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,300
Wait. How can you tell?

649
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
I couldn't, so I was cheated.

650
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,800
Brother Xia Xia, who'd even be able to tell?

651
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
Exactly.

652
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Brother saw through it immediately.

653
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,800
My sister also knew at once.

654
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,400
She said the earnings were too high.

655
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,000
A'Yuan, you should study hard.

656
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,600
Brother Xia Xia, will you go to Shanghai?

657
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,300
Nope, I have no money.

658
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,400
I also have to figure some things out.

659
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,900
Brother Xia Xia, have you been brainwashed by your sister?

660
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,000
Aren't you going to make a living in Shanghai?

661
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm not brainwashed.

662
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,000
My sister is well-educated. She knows more than I do.

663
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Educated folks are different.

664
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,200
You're right.

665
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
A'Yuan, study hard when you go back.

666
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
Don't talk to me.

667
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,200
You're still angry?

668
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,300
We're buddies.

669
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,600
Brother Xia Xia didn't even betray me, but you did!

670
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,200
I... I had no choice.

671
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Your brother slammed me against the wall.

672
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,000
If I didn't agree, he would've beaten me to a pulp.

673
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,800
- I'll—
- A'Yuan, don't blame Xiao Liang.

674
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Brother has many tricks up his sleeve.

675
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,900
It's fine for you to use his old phone,

676
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,400
but why are you using his accounts?

677
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,900
Are you an idiot?

678
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,600
If I play games and buy skins,

679
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,000
I can use his money.

680
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Even you can't outsmart him. Xiao Liang stands no chance.

681
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,500
That's true.

682
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,200
He kicked me real hard in the ass.

683
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,400
My butt still hurts.

684
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,800
I feel like I've aged.

685
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,900
You're only 16.

686
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm 18. I'm old.

687
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,600
Get lost!

688
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,200
- How about a round?
- Sure.

689
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,100
Nah, I'm not in the mood.

690
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,400
You can use Baili Shouyue.

691
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,200
But I...

692
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,700
Get online.

693
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,400
- I haven't logged in yet.
- I'll send you an invitation.

694
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
Wait for me. I haven't logged in.

695
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,400
Does Baili Shouyue have any skins?

696
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Have black tea at night.

697
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,200
Remember to brew the tea at a low temperature.

698
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
More theanine and glutamic acid will be brought out.

699
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
They'll help you sleep well.

700
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,500
Hey, Little Sister Damai!

701
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,600
What wind blew you here?

702
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,900
I seldom see you downstairs.

703
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,000
Mr. Ma. Na Na.

704
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,700
Two out of three beauties are here. Only one isn't here.

705
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,400
Little Sister Hongdou. I'll call her down.

706
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,200
Don't call her. She's tired from traveling.

707
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,000
We invited her for tea but she refused.

708
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,600
What's going on?

709
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,100
I promised to host an arrival party,

710
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,000
but it's been delayed for ages.

711
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,600
It'll be a goodbye ceremony in no time.

712
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,000
Do you mean farewell?

713
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,400
It's all the same.

714
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
Is she afraid of me?

715
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,200
Why is she avoiding me?

716
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,000
Why would she avoid you?

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
It's all your fault.

718
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,600
You make me out to be a playboy.

719
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,000
We never said you were a playboy.

720
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,900
Besides, "playboy" is such an archiac word.

721
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,400
Only elders like my mom use it.

722
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Right now, we say "Poseidon".

723
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,700
Yes, I know. Poseidon.

724
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,800
He holds a trident and has a chest full of hair.

725
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,500
That man, right?

726
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,500
Knowing you know nothing

727
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,000
is the beginning of wisdom.

728
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,400
Know, knowing, know?

729
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
I get a headache the moment you speak.

730
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,000
Recently, I composed a new song.

731
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,300
"A Lonely Man."

732
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,400
