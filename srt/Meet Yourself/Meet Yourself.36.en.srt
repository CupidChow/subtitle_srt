Dad!

6
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,940
What are you looking at?

7
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,480
A'Yao, what are you doing so late in the night?

8
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,080
Aunty got me to pick you up for fear that you'll sleep on the streets drunk.

9
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,380
She's such a worrywart.

10
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,380
What were you looking at?

11
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,210
The street lamp.

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,910
When we first installed this, your grandpa said

13
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,440
our village is finally the same as the cities.

14
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,880
I asked him what cities were like.

15
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,430
He said there are bright lights,

16
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,250
and bustling people and traffic.

17
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,359
- I'll lend you a hand.
- Save it.

18
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm fine.

19
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,200
What were you chatting about with Grandpa Yang?

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,430
Nothing much.

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,830
Just about my childhood memories of your grandpa.

22
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,990
Then, we talked badly about Deqing.

23
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,270
People become stubborn when they get old.

24
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,700
I can chide him a little now,

25
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,030
but I may not have the energy to do so in a few years.

26
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,150
I may only be able to gasp when I'm angry.

27
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,370
Could my grandpa only gasp when he passed away?

28
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,600
A'Yao, stop harping on that matter.

29
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,679
I'm not. I'm just mentioning it in passing.

30
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,520
You still begrudge me for that.

31
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,350
I don't.

32
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,960
You begrudge me for not telling you.

33
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,959
You didn't live with me when you were young. You aren't that close to me.

34
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,040
Two years ago,

35
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,040
I didn't help you but caused more trouble for you.

36
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,630
Why are you self-reflecting out of the blue?

37
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,679
So ridiculous. Are you drunk?

38
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,460
No, I'm not.

39
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,340
A'Yao,

40
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,820
you and your girlfriend can focus on your careers.

41
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,470
If you have children, I'll take care of them.

42
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,530
Forget it.

43
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,620
Do you still begrudge me?

44
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,040
Didn't you say that a child will be distant if they're sent away?

45
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,230
That makes sense.

46
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,200
All right. You can take care of your own kids.

47
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,070
These are two different matters.

48
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll buy you a big and beautiful multi-purpose van.

49
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,180
Keep the money for A'Yuan.

50
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,090
I reckon he won't achieve much in the future.

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,380
You're his elder brother. Won't you intervene?

52
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,990
I'm his brother, not his dad. Why should I be responsible?

53
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,670
Besides, you said my work was a waste of time.

54
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,740
I'd only end up as a beggar.

55
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,270
When did I say that?

56
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,970
When I built the courtyard.

57
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,480
No, I didn't.

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,780
- Denying it now?
- There's no way I'd say that!

59
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,480
Fine. I hope you can remember when you're sober tomorrow.

60
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,869
- Sober? I didn't drink. Your aunty forbids me from drinking.
- Really?

61
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:10,660
Grandpa Yang was so drunk that he was on the floor.

62
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,880
- I didn't drink.
- You didn't? Come on. Walk straight.

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,679
I'm walking straight.

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,690
I've been walking straight from way back there.

65
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,759
Really? Come on. I'll give you a hand.

66
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,910
How many children do you want in the future?

I can. I'll go with Damai.

Damai, here.

I'm heading off to work. I won't wash my bowl.

- Okay, just leave it.
- See you tonight.

112

- Bye-bye.
- Go.

Goodbye, Cuo Bazi.

114

I'm leaving.

115
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,469
- Na Na!
- Aunty Feng.

116
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,409
- Whose big dog is this?
- Damai's.

117
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:16,640
Our dear writer? Didn't you leave?

118
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
I came back to visit Hongdou and Na Na.

119
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,020
That's good.

120
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,830
Aunty Feng, who are you looking for?

121
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,410
No one in particular.

122
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,369
Aunty A'Gui and her husband went to visit their children.

123
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,440
So, I'm helping her clean the place for a few days.

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,270
Do you know how to tidy this place?

125
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,720
I do. Carry on eating. I'm fine.

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,490
What a nice dog. I'm sure it eats a lot each time.

127
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,150
Aunty Feng, it really has a huge appetite.

128
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll get to work.

129
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,400
Cuo Bazi!

130
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,260
We're going out!

131
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,329
- Good morning.
- Morning!
- Morning!

132
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,080
Cuo Bazi, good morning.

133
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,460
Na Na, do you have a vase?

134
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,050
Give them to me.

135
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,910
Well? How is Chairman Xie's stepmother?

136
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,640
She's nice.

137
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,530
You have to interact with her more.

138
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,550
You can't just judge based on her appearance.

139
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,820
Maybe she'll poison you.

140
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,499
Exactly. Even the best mother-in-law will spark conflicts in the same household.

141
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:37,849
We just met and had a meal. You two are letting your imaginations run wild.

142
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,970
- Damai, are you done eating?
- Yes, I'm just waiting for you.

143
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,250
Let's go.

144
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,119
- You can eat first.
- The designer is urging me to head over.

145
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,720
- Na Na, could you tidy up?
- Okay.

146
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,250
Let's go.

147
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,509
Hongdou, should I get you a bottle of milk?

148
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,570
Nah, this is enough.

149
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,570
- We're off. Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.

150
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm leading Cuo Bazi out to play!

151
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,500
Sister, heading to the fields?

152
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes, I am.

153
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Hongdou, is she a friend coming to visit?

154
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, she's here to visit.

155
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
- See you.
- See you.

156
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Come on, Cuo Bazi.

157
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
- Who's she?
- A lady from the village.

158
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,500
<i>[Open for business. Ring the doorbell for pottery.]</i>

159
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,400
Yang Xu? You're back.

160
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Tuotuo!

161
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Sister Hongdou.

162
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
Your friend?

163
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,000
She used to live in the courtyard.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,300
I know her. You're Sister Damai.

165
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Why do you know everyone?

166
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,700
Sister Hongdou, my parents won't leave.

167
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
They won't leave?

168
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Is it hard to earn money as a driver in Kunming?

169
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,400
We can make ends meet, but we just aren't used to life there.

170
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,800
We missed him as well.

171
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,900
Since there are more tourists here, more drivers are needed.

172
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,200
So, we want to give it a shot here.

173
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Tuotuo, you must be overjoyed. Right?

174
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,300
By the way, when will your homestay open?

175
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,900
It's still too early for that. The place is being renovated.

176
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,200
I can pick up your guests.

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
If your car is in good condition, that'll work.

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,100
- Okay. Let's discuss this again.
- Okay.

179
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Bye-bye.

180
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,500
- Sister Hongdou, I'll visit you next time.
- Okay.

181
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,200
- Bye-bye, Tuotuo.
- Bye-bye.

182
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
Bye-bye.

183
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
Isn't he cute?

184
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Tuotuo is really adorable.

185
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,600
I think we should keep it to three colors.

186
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Redesign the font, words, and logo.

187
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,200
Let's put them here. Okay.

188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Chairman Xie, someone offered a promotion for "Master, Hit Me Again."

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Though, they aren't offering much money.

190
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
What kind of promotion?

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
Shelled peanuts.

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
That sounds promising. Talk with them.

193
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay.

194
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,500
Aunty Feng, what's wrong?

195
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Xie Qiang will be released from prison soon.

196
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,100
I'm wondering... Does your dad need help?

197
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,900
If he doesn't mind,

198
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
we can send XIe Qiang straight to Kunming.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,700
My dad definitely won't mind,

200
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,000
but what do you mean by sending him straight there?

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,600
He should stay home for a few days and readapt to life.

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,100
We have to hear his opinions as well. Don't you think so?

203
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,800
I don't think it's right to send him there right away.

204
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,200
I want him to stay at home for a short while.

205
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,300
But once the relatives know he's released,

206
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,600
they'll come to see him.

207
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,500
They won't just mutter unpleasant things for a day.

208
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
It'll continue as people drop by.

209
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,500
Even thinking about this upsets me.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,900
Aunty Feng, I know you want to protect him.

211
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,100
But Xie Qiang is in his thirties after all.

212
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,500
- How long can you protect him?
- That's true.

213
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,600
It's inevitable that there'll be gossip when he's released.

214
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
But can you hide him or send him away

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
so he never meets any relatives or friends?

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,500
He made a mistake

217
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
and has paid the price for it.

218
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
You should boost his confidence.

219
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Let him feel optimistic about the future. Isn't that right?

220
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,600
His release from prison is great news for you guys.

221
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,700
Boldly inform your relatives and friends, and hold a feast.

222
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Don't drag things on either. Invite all of them over at once.

223
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,400
Deal with it in one go.

224
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,700
Hold a feast?

225
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
Yes. Hold a feast.

226
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Let everyone know that this is an event worth celebrating.

227
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,100
Don't let them mock you.

228
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,000
Most importantly, this is the best way to help Xie Qiang.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,800
How long can you protect him?

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,400
That's true.

231
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
A'Yao, you're right.

232
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,800
He has to rely on himself once he's out.

233
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,300
I'll hold a feast.

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Don't worry.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
Okay. It's settled then.

236
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,020
Hi.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
You're back?

238
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm heading out.

239
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
Where are you going?

240
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm going to the farm with the campsite.

241
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Bye-bye.

242
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,600
Hold on! I can give you a lift.

243
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Wait!

244
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,500
Stop! Wait!

245
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Wait for me! Slow down!

246
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
Wait a minute! Slow down!

247
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,800
The road is bumpy! Wait up!

248
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,500
Wait! I'm coming!

249
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Stop!

250
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,400
Get on.

251
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Be careful. The road is bumpy.

252
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm exhausted.

253
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,900
Will it survive?

254
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,300
I don't know.

255
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,400
When planting fruit trees,

256
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,800
it's important to choose seedlings

257
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,700
the size of your thumb.

258
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,800
Those are most likely to survive.

259
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't they all sprout from a seed?

260
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
I doubt yours will survive.

261
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,800
You're a little talkative today.

262
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,300
If you're busy, you can go back.

263
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000
You're the same as all those other women.

264
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
What do you mean?

265
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
You're just taking me for a ride.

266
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
When did I do that?

267
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,600
You used to look for me all the time and treated me excellently.

268
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
You didn't want me to be wronged and insisted I hold my head high.

269
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,900
You told me to love myself.

270
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,200
When you got what you wanted from me,

271
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
you're treating me like a stranger.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
You don't even come to listen to me sing.

273
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,200
You even traveled to Kunming and Meili Snow Mountains alone!

274
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
You're acting as if nothing happened!

275
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,600
Are you trying to shove blame to the victim?

276
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Weren't you the one avoiding me?

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
In fact, I don't really care.

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm just afraid of startling you.

279
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,500
What are the meaning of your words?

280
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,600
Aren't you afraid of me pestering you?

281
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,000
A divorcee in her forties with a 19-year-old daughter clinging onto you.

282
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,000
I didn't think that.

283
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,100
There's a different matter.

284
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I just...

285
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,500
I just can't get used to this.

286
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Sorry, I misunderstood you.

287
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,600
You certainly did.

288
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
I...

289
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,400
really like being with you.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
That's fine.

291
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,500
What do you mean by that?

292
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,400
I mean, it's fine as long as you feel at ease.

293
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm fine with whatever.

294
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll water the vegetables.

295
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,600
You know? Bitter gourd vines grow fast. I'll show you.

296
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm fine with that?

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
What does that mean?

298
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Xiao Yu, hurry up!

299
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Take the bucket.

300
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay.

301
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,900
Xiao Hu Lu, would you like some eggs?

302
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,600
Don't do that. Let her help herself.

303
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, she can take her own food.

304
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
Help yourself, okay?

305
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Xiaochun, your vegetables are here.

306
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
All the dishes have been served.

307
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,100
Aunty Hua, did you make a fortune lately?

308
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
I did.

309
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Xiangdong's shoulders need diathermy so that he can cook.

310
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
If this goes on, the hospital will be making a fortune, too.

311
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,900
That won't do.

312
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,100
We have no other choice.

313
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,000
Huzi's future expenses will stack up.

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>Waitress! Two bottles of tamarind juice!</i>

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Coming!

316
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Enjoy your meal.

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Go on.

318
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
- Xiaochun, have some of this.
- No, thanks.

319
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
I can help myself.

320
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Okay.

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Come on. President Zhang. Madam. This way, please.

322
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
This is a great restaurant.

323
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
I often visit here.

324
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,200
- Sister!
- Hello.

325
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
- Five guests. Please clean the table.
- Okay.

326
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Sit here. This table can take five customers.

327
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,800
Thank you.

328
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm sorry!

329
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,300
- Is the child okay?
- Yeah, don't worry.

330
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah, don't worry.

331
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm really sorry.

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Let me help you.

333
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,500
Dad!

334
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
Xiao Hu Lu! Why are you here?

335
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
I'm having lunch with Mom.

336
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm here with my customers.

337
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,300
I'll bring snacks to you tonight.

338
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,800
Go back.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
- Come on. Madam, this way.
- Okay.

340
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
<i>President Zhang.</i>

341
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,700
Dad said he's with customers.

342
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,200
He'll visit me at home tonight.

343
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,700
Okay. I know.

344
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Shall we have lunch?

345
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,400
What is the job of Xiao Hu Lu's dad?

346
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,300
He sells water purifiers.

347
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
No wonder he's with customers all the time.

348
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,300
Eat up.

349
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, no!

350
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
I surrender!

351
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Stop!

352
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,700
Ouch!

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,800
I surrender!

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
<i>Have lunch. They can play by themselves.</i>

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>It's fine. You two can eat first.</i>

356
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>Hurry up!</i>

357
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Sorry, we're closed.

358
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,900
Na Na invited me over.

359
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
- Reporter Xu?
- Yes.

360
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
I finally have the chance to meet you.

362
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Do you want a drink?

363
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,000
Thank you. I'm fine with anything.

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
- Xiao Xin, get me a pot of tea.
- Okay.

365
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,700
- This way, please.
- Okay.

366
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,840
Yang Xuebao, from the fourth village group, insists on getting a loan,

367
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,300
but he has no mortgages to his name.

368
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,499
So, he asked us for a letter of guarantee.

369
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,079
I told him we can't write the letter.

370
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,379
I suggested he start a small business along the street. That has a low cost.

371
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:03,320
He refuses and insists on the loan.

372
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,460
Ask Yang Xuebao to come tomorrow.

373
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,050
I'll speak to him in person.

374
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,320
Okay.

375
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,249
Li Xiaoping from the second village group wants to transform her old home into a homestay.

376
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,220
I went to her house this morning.

377
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,950
The roof is covered with plastic sheets.

378
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,579
I'm afraid the walls will collapse.

379
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:25,809
That was terrifying. Safety isn't even a guarantee.

380
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:29,500
She doesn't want to renovate either.

381
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,720
She says she'll do so after making money.

382
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,840
I know her.

383
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,620
She raised chickens,

384
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,000
but her family was lazy and her home stnk.

385
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,299
She wants to run a homestay?

386
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,130
Yes.

387
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,320
Chairman Xie, say something.

388
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,779
Which of these families can we help?

389
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,930
Their ideas are ridiculous.

390
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,680
They do seem rather ridiculous.

391
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,550
The village committee can dissuade them, but I can't.

392
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,069
I'm also a businessman.

393
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,099
I bet they'll talk about how I'm making money in the village,

394
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:15,270
but preventing others from sharing in the profits.

395
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,790
A'Yao, this is really a hard nut to crack.

396
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,009
But you're the best at business management.

397
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,059
Share your thoughts with us.

398
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,570
Speak your mind.

399
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,250
We aren't strangers.

400
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,580
I... I know. But I haven't thought of any good solutions, either.

401
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,729
The problems mentioned by Xiao Huang are tricky.

402
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,869
You guys just have to dissuade them.

403
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,380
If Yang Xuebao really gets online loans or goes to a loan shark on impulse,

404
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,770
he may be in deep trouble.

405
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,579
The rent for the bookstore has been settled.

406
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,879
After the contract is signed, they'll work out a plan.

407
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,949
I'm pretty sure they'll get furnishings made in a factory and send them straight over to be assembled.

408
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:01,840
This will shorten renovation time and reduce damage to the area.

409
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,789
We'll have to speak with the neighboring residents in advance.

410
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,170
Make sure the renovation doesn't bother them, or there'll be conflicts.

411
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,630
Got it.

412
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,299
Are they recruiting workers from our village?

413
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,520
That's what they hope to do.

414
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,070
Okay.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
Hongdou!

416
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,379
Let me introduce her.

417
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:29,250
Xu Hongdou, the boss of our village's homestay.

418
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,270
She's also my girlfriend.

419
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,249
Secretary Li of the Party Branch. You've met him before.

420
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:37,499
- Hello, Secretary Li.
- Here we meet again.

421
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:39,249
This is the village director.

422
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,730
- Hello, Village Director.
- Nice to meet you.

423
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,340
Excellent. Work hard.

424
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,480
Let's develop our village together.

425
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,249
Don't worry. I'll obey all rules of our village.

426
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,990
Okay.

427
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,420
We'll leave if you don't need me.

428
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,500
You're done?

429
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,249
We just asked him for ideas. Nothing else.

430
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:02,839
- Shall we wait for you?
- It's fine.

431
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,760
I'll visit a granny with the secretary later. Okay.

432
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,300
Well, we'll get going.

433
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,829
Bye-bye.

434
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,599
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Goodbye!

435
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,760
- Take care.
- Thank you for the hard work.

436
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm exhausted.

437
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,660
Doesn't the site have surveillance cameras?

438
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,530
The foremen and designer are there as well.

439
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,250
Why do you have to go over personally?

440
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,030
I'm worried that there'll be problems.

441
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,069
There'll always be problems, especially ones you can't predict.

442
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,630
You need my guidance on how to be a boss.

443
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,390
Your guidance?

444
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,900
Are you a teacher now after barely taking baby steps out of elementary school?

445
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,839
Elementary school? You're just a first-grader in elementary school.

446
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,169
Don't you think I have every right to do so?

447
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,250
Fine. Senior, please enlighten me.

448
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,040
Lesson one. Learn to stop worrying.

449
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,760
Do I need to learn that?

450
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,309
Of course. I paid school fees to learn that.

451
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:05,180
At the start, I was worried about everything.

452
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,799
Yet, all I got were misunderstandings.

453
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,139
They said I didn't give them enough space or trusted them.

454
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:16,149
Even Xiaochun asked me if I thought those folks were incompetent.

455
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,560
Wait! What's wrong with doing more? The tasks are set.

456
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,050
If you do more, others can do less.

457
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,349
You've been an employee for too long.

458
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,059
Your mind is stuck as an employee.

459
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,479
Everyone does their tasks, while the boss does their work.

460
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,030
Why did you even hire them?

461
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,450
You can make suggestions about their work,

462
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,200
but don't interfere with their work too much.

463
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,310
Hold on. I'm the one paying,

464
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,549
so I'm responsible for the final results. It's hard to be completely assured.

465
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:46,939
Look. This is a boss's mentality.

466
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:49,590
Employees should concentrate on their work.

467
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,290
The boss should learn to trust employees and make maneuvers for the larger picture.

468
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,400
One person cannot form a team.

469
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,960
That makes sense.

470
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,020
You should pay for this lesson.

471
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,741
Give me your hand.

Hold on. It's so dark. No one can see us.

When did you come here?

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,349
I arrived with guests today.

I just took them to the homestay, so I'm buying food for my kid.

Xu Hongdou, my girlfriend.

488
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,760
- Sister.
- Hello.

489
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,009
How are your sales?

490
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,139
So-so.

491
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:03,169
The guests today bought quite a bit.

492
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,380
I might be able to earn up to ¥6,000.

493
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,690
Here. All done.

494
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,409
Sister, take some. No, thanks.

495
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,820
Granny cooked for us.

496
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,649
Okay. Hurry on home. She's going to bed.

497
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:23,810
Okay.

498
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,539
I'm off, Brother.

499
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,330
Sister. Brother Guanjun.

500
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,969
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

501
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,580
Xiaochun's ex-husband plods a little.

502
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,469
Plods? Hesitant and dawdling.

503
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:44,979
Considering Xiaochun's character, how can they live together?

504
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,579
Has Uncle Siping left?

505
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,470
Yes. He's busy, too.

506
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,989
Here. Eat up.

507
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,999
It's hot. Okay.

508
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,620
Which one do you want?

509
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,540
- This one.
- Okay.

510
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,640
By the way, should I pick up Xie Qiang with you?

511
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,258
Do you want to come?

512
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:08,780
If I don't go while you're there, he may think I don't care about him.

513
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,619
- Okay. I'll call you.
- Sure.

514
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,109
We're heading to the supermarket. See you.

515
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,480
Okay.

516
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,500
Let's go.

517
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,609
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

518
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,079
This is Xia Xia's top. It'll probably fit you.

519
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,590
Thank you.

520
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,610
Are those easy to wash?

521
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,799
- It's hard to remove the oil.
- I'll help you.

522
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,549
- It's fine. I can do it.
- Come on.

523
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,170
Thank you.

524
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,380
Here?

525
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,440
Yes, the sleeve.

526
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,330
Your guest's family is pretty interesting.

527
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,950
You have to eat with them and even be their babysitter.

528
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,280
It's nice for a family to travel together.

529
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,930
I don't have to drink with them.

530
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,490
Didn't you enjoy drinking?

531
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,750
Every time you'd get drunk, you'd vomit in the toilet

532
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:25,180
and blabber about working to support me and Xiao Hu Lu.

533
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,260
- Xiaochun.
- Yeah?

534
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,010
Was the man eating with you today...

535
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,390
your boyfriend?

536
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,209
Nope. He's wooing me.

537
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:44,640
How is his family?

538
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,029
Why do you want to know that?

539
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,400
Mind your own business.

540
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,470
By the way,

541
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,200
have you told Xiao Hu Lu's grandparents about her elementary school?

542
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,000
Yes.

543
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,390
And?

544
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,820
They said further discussion is needed.

545
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,789
They're coming over for Xiao Hu Lu's performance.

546
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,920
We can talk about it then.

547
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,160
That means they disagree.

548
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,560
What is your opinion?

549
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,480
I'll go with your decision.

550
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,400
I want to know your real thoughts.

551
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,830
Actually, it's better to study in Kunming.

552
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:42,860
Besides, we bought that house because of school district housing.

553
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,400
Are you angry?

554
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,890
I'm not.

555
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,619
Xiaochun, I'll go with whatever you say.

556
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,439
You don't have to do that.

557
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,240
I'll take your opinion into consideration.

558
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,770
Let's discuss this when your parents get here.

559
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,820
Granny, pick one.

560
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,149
Look at the card first. Don't tell me.

561
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,090
Don't show me.

562
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,250
Sister Hongdou.

563
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,150
Look at the card and keep it in mind.

564
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,630
Done.

565
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,510
Granny, put this in the middle.

566
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,259
I'm shuffling now. Tell me when to stop.

567
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,400
Stop.

568
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,439
Mind reading is not deception.

569
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,100
I can tell which card it is by reading your expressions.

570
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,190
Granny, we have to be expressionless.

571
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,709
It's useless.

572
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,730
That's because I'm reading your hearts.

573
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,500
I sense it! It's definitely the two of hearts!

574
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Amazing!

575
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You're good enough for the Spring Festival Gala.

576
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,700
- Really?
- Yes.

577
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,500
I have to go. I want to perform magic for Huzi.

578
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,800
Don't look for him.

579
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,100
I'll take Damai and you to Granny Feng's house.

580
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm not going.

581
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,100
It's for a feast.

582
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,700
I don't want to. I'm scared.

583
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,600
Why are you scared?

584
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,100
Xie Qiang's arm is so thick and he's very tall.

585
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,100
He can break the door plank with one punch. I'm scared.

586
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,900
Granny, I have to go.

587
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,600
Okay. Take care.

588
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,700
Safety first.

589
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,100
Be careful.

590
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Is she talking about Xie Qiang or Dwayne Johnson?

591
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Parents frighten kids in that way.

592
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,900
<i>[Qifeng Prison]</i>

593
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,700
- A'Qiang!
- A'Qiang!

594
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Let's go! We're heading home!

595
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,700
The village has changed a lot.

596
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,900
You haven't come back for years, so you don't know

597
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,000
that tourists are flooding the place.

598
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,700
Things only got better this year.

599
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,000
You're just in time.

600
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,400
Exactly.

601
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
My barbecue stand is doing decently.

602
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,200
A'Qiang, think about what you want to work as.

603
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,000
Ask A'Yao for advice.

604
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,400
A few years ago, the villagers were mocking him.

605
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Now, they ask him for advice about everything.

606
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
One more thing, Xie Qiang.

607
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,100
It's good news that you're released.

608
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
There's a feast at home.

609
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
Relatives and friends will come.

610
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
The day will fly by.

611
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>- Come on.
- Let me see what you have.</i>

612
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

613
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
Coming!

614
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
Eat more!

615
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,300
<i>Thank you!</i>

616
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,200
- Come on!
<i>- Nice!</i>

617
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,600
- Eat more.
<i>- Thank you!</i>

618
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Here you go.

619
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,400
Hurry up. Eat more.

620
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
Aunty Feng!

621
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
Master asked when he can start cooking.

622
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Call A'Yao.

623
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,400
Ask him where he is.

624
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,700
- We'll start cooking when he's reaching.
- Okay.

625
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,900
- Give me the pot.
- Okay.

626
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,300
Pass me that pot. I'll add water.

627
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Have some tea!

628
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Drink when it's hot!

629
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,000
Give me the tea pot!

630
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,100
Okay.

631
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,200
- Thank you so much!
- Have your fill!

632
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Okay, thank you.

633
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,700
Hongdou! Writer!

634
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,300
I'm so happy.

635
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,100
No, you can't. I can't accept this!

636
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,300
- You should take it!
- No, I can't.

637
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm already over the moon that you're here!

638
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,900
Thank you.

639
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
- Sit here.
- Okay.

640
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,800
They're the relatives of A'Chang and me.

641
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,900
You don't know them.

642
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,400
Have some tea.

643
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,600
- You don't need to bother with us. You can get on with other tasks.
- Okay.

644
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,800
We can help ourselves.

645
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,300
Okay.

646
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm happy.

647
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,059
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

648
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:45,900
Aunty Feng! My brother said he's arriving soon.

649
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,400
- Hurry up.
- Xia Xia!

650
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,700
Hello, Sister Hongdou and Sister Damai.

651
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,400
Are you here on behalf of your family?

652
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I'm here to help out.

653
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
- Go on.
- I'll go to the kitchen.

654
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Eat!

655
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,799
Is it okay for me to join this feast?

656
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,600
The villagers usually have a feast at night.

657
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Aunty Feng knows you're here.

658
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
She asked me to bring you over.

659
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,300
She said you're impressive.

660
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,700
You're here so she can boast before her relatives.

661
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,000
Look at how delighted she is.

662
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,600
I've never seen her so pleased before.

663
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,900
I'm impressive?

664
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm not.

665
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,300
You are. Pretty impressive.

666
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,900
Let me do some introductions.

667
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,600
This is Hongdou, A'Yao's girlfriend.

668
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,700
She's pretty and capable.

669
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,800
She's the boss of the homestay!

670
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,800
Yes.

671
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,000
This young lady is even more amazing.

672
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
She's a writer.

673
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,800
She makes money online by writing articles.

674
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
They're very busy.

675
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
They made time just to come here.

676
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Let's welcome them!

677
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,600
Thank you!

678
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Have some food.

679
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,100
This is so embarrassing.

680
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,800
It's fine.

681
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Eat.

682
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,300
Should I explain things clearly to Aunty Feng?

683
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,900
What explanation?

684
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,100
That I'm just a puny 28-year-old web novelist

685
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,500
who can't even churn out an update.

686
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm even worried sick about subscriptions.

687
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,800
My works are blocked and plagiarized.

688
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,100
Also...

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,400
Eat up.

690
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,600
I can't even sell any copyrights.

691
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,800
Novelists like me

692
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,200
get the worst scolding and beating.

693
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,100
I have a hunch that I won't even need to pay taxes next year...

694
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,400
with my pathetic reading views.

695
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm striving for no losses next year.

696
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,600
Good goal.

697
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,200
Nice.

698
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
Boss Xu, have a baby soon.

699
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,800
I'll wish you great fortune along the way.

700
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,500
Mom said she wanted to repair this wall.

701
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,600
Since you're back, you can repair it at any time.

702
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,200
I'll help you.

703
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,200
Go on in.

704
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,500
Your parents are waiting for you.

705
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,200
Get moving.

706
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,600
Cheer up.

707
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
<i>I cooked the melon seeds myself.</i>

708
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,000
Aunty Feng, he's back.

709
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,000
Dad.

710
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,200
A'Qiang.

711
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,800
Mom.

712
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,600
You're back.

713
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,100
You're back.

714
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,600
Son.

715
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Go and see your granny.

716
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,200
A'Qiang.

717
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,400
Granny.

718
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,300
You're back.

719
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
Good.

720
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,300
Good...

721
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,400
Don't cry. Don't cry.

722
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,000
Son.

723
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh, right.

724
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,900
Play cards with your dad.

725
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,400
There aren't any seats left here.

726
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,600
Sit with the younger folks.

727
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,900
A'Yao, let him sit with you.

728
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,900
He just came back.

729
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,300
- Let him change his clothes and wash up.
- That's right.

730
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,900
- Tidy up and get ready for lunch.
- Yes. Go on in.

731
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,000
Change your clothes.

732
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,800
The clothes are on the bed.

733
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,000
Okay.

734
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,300
<i>Sure.</i>

735
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
Carry on eating. Eat up.

736
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,400
Okay.

737
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I always thought he'd be tall and robust.

738
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
He looks rather ordinary.

739
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
He was sent to prison for stealing.

740
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,400
He wasn't arrested for being a thug.

741
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,000
That's true.

742
