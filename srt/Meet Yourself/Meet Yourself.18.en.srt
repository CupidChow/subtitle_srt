It's beautiful.

17
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,440
What are you doing?

18
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,790
Enjoying the sunrise.

19
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,740
Why are you filming me?

20
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,080
Weren't you filming the sunrise?

21
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,770
I'm recording the person enjoying this sunrise with me.

22
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,578
He's Xie Zhiyao.

23
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:57,470
He's the village beau of Yunmiao and a promising entrepreneur.

24
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,770
He's a little poor,

25
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,684
but... he's a solid gentleman.

26
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:06,442
He's kind and filial.

27
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:10,530
His friends and family are rallying to help him get married.

28
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,090
I don't need help with my marriage.

29
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,034
I want to focus on my career.

30
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,640
You didn't say so last time.

31
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,540
I haven't even washed my face, and I have gunk in my eyes. Stop filming me.

32
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,271
- It's fine.
- Stop!

33
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,680
Stop!

34
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,980

Where are you going?

41
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,758
I'm going back to visit my parents.

42
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,190
Are you refining elixirs in there?

43
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,841
I just woke up. I haven't cleaned up.

44
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,741
Hold on. Do you have someone to take you to the airport?

45
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:49,000
- Xiaochun is driving me there.
- Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

46
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,090
You don't have to see me off.

47
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,800
I won't. Stop daydreaming.

48
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,900
I'm going downstairs.

49
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,770
I'll help you.

50
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,940
- I'm fine. I can manage.
- You're not young anymore.

51
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,466
Let go.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,796
Damai, I'm off.

53
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,670
Take care.

54
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
You don't have to see me off. Give it to me.

55
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,870
I'm not seeing you off! I'm just heading out for a stroll.

56
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,190
Let's go.

57
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,671
You're still sleepy. Don't go out.

58
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,330
I'll get going.

59

60
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,330

61
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,430
There are cups in there.

62

66
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:35,800
Send a message when you get home.

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,720
Okay, I'll send a meessage in the group chat.

68
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,971
- Go back.
- Have a safe trip.

69
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,010
That's nice.

70
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,264
Mr. Ma is reinvigorated.

71
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,822
Wonderful.

72
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,596
I feel like crap.

73
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,330
I can't write any songs.

74
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,650
I can't write my draft.

75
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,660
How about... we rent a piece of farmland?

76
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,950
What are we farming?

77
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,720

What do you have in mind?

79
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,770
Flowers.

80
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,300
What flowers?

81
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,528
Flowers that will pave a flowery path for me.

82
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
What about you?

83
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,280
I...

84
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,904
I want to plant the sun.

85
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,224

Your fried rice is nice. Why aren't you eating?

105
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,290
I have no appetite.

106
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,390
You really won't eat?

107
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,180
What a waste.

108
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,030
The grannies say that after death,

109
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,338
we have to finish all the food we wasted to be reincarnated.

110
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,316
Thank you.

111
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,020
What's wrong?

112
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,842
I'm just wondering how I can help my friend.

113
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:50,150
You have money. Lend them some.

114
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,410
That's superficial.

115
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,498
This isn't a matter of money, but of work.

116
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,000
She...

117
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,934
She lacks confidence.

118
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,220
Encourage her.

119
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,720
Cheer her on.

120
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,522
Eat your leftovers.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,530
As a wood carving apprentice, my master had always scolded me.

122
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,350
He had said my works were trash.

123
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,336
I really wanted to give up back then.

124
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:22,520
But I overheard my master scolding my junior.

125
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,760
He said, "You shouldn't learn from Xia Xia.

126
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,170
He's lazy,

127
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,540
but he's smart, skilled, and a quick learner."

128
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,250
I was pretty delighted.

129
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,650
You just enjoy your master's praises.

130
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,770
That's not it.

131
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,050
I think she needs positive encouragement.

132
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,938
I did that.

133
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:46,582
I told her she's great.

134
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:51,090
Though, it didn't seem to do much.

135
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,420
Maybe she just thinks you're being polite.

136
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,970
That's not true.

137
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,020
My words were sincere.

138
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,140
Should I repeat myself a few more times?

139
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,852
Just like brainwashing.

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,880
<i>[I'm revising the manuscript. You guys can eat first.]</i>

141
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,620
<i>[You're doing really well. Don't push yourself too hard, and come down to eat first.]</i>

142
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,220
I failed in luring her out.

143
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,790
Damai is revising her manuscript, so she isn't eating.

144
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,290
What happened?

145
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,162
Isn't she the most eager about food?

146
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,456
I cooked too much.

147
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,532
How about inviting Mr. Hu over?

148
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,050
Okay.

149
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,938
Mr. Hu!

150
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,920
Mr. Hu!

151
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,230
Do you want to come down for rice noodles?

152
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,160
Mr. Hu sent a WeChat saying he'll pass. He's gone to bed.

153
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,450
Isn't he the most boisterous?

154
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,850
This is really strange.

155
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,930
Listen up.

156
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,080
Creatives have drastic mood swings.

157
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,340
When I came back, I saw Damai and Mr. Hu sitting there.

158
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,552
They were staring at each other listlessly.

159
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,554
I cooked too much. It's such a waste.

160
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,250
Get your fiance to eat it.

161
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,630
My fiance?

162
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,574
He's probably in bed by now.

163
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,100
I realized an amazing strength of yours.

164
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,170
What is it?

165
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,794
You can take jokes really well.

166
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,530
I may treat it as a joke and find it funny,

167
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,050
but others may think differently.

168
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm just more tolerant than others.

169
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,350
When working in a hotel,

170
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,404
you have to bear with anything the guests say.

171
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:13,912
You even have to smile and agree.

172
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,988
What if it's really severe?

173
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:23,410
For example, defamation, slander, and damage to one's reputation?

174
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,330
We'll let the law punish them.

175
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,170
A'Yao, what do you want to eat? I'll cook for you.

176
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,852
It's too late. I can do without food.

177
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,544
How can you skip food?

178
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:45,470
I'll cook rice cake noodles for you.

179
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,550
I also cooked loads of minced meat this morning.

180
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,406
I'll add some and pair it with two fried eggs for a yummy meal.

181
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:57,610
Granny, I forgot to tell you that we ran out of minced meat.

182
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,020
No way.

183
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,530
There was half a pot left this morning.

184
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,910
I took it to the courtyard.

185
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,290
You're so kind to her,

186
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,788
but does she reciprocate your feelings?

187
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:14,844
Xu Hongdou and I are just friends.

188
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,512
I never mentioned Hongdou.

189
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
You... Can you go downstairs?

190
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,390
I'm busy with drafting the promotion plans.

191
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,770
I'll cook.

192
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,240
You have to eat.

193
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,196
Got it.

194
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,480
<i>[Dou: Gone to bed? Want some rice noodles?]</i>

195
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,224
Granny, you don't have to cook.

196
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,646
Isn't this the minced meat from my home?

197
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:04,420
Yes.

198
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,190
What did you cook?

199
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,374
Rice noodles with cabbage.

200
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:12,410
Well done, Masterchef!

201
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,934
I'm just kidding.

202
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,738
I have to admit, Chairman Xie is an amazing cook.

203
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,942
Granny taught me everything.

204
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:26,688
She has been adding too much salt lately, so I forbid her from cooking.

205
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,624
What's this about Mr. Hu feeling down?

206
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,930
He's a little depressed.

207
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,170
It's probably because he lost his job.

208
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,570
He lost his job?

209
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,860
The two bars where he sang at closed down.

210
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,920
Haven't you noticed that he hasn't gone out lately?

211
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,690
No way.

212
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,136
He caused two bars to close down?

213
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,542
Did he meet my dad?

214
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,162
Uncle Xie was only around for a few days.

215
00:16:57,162 --> 00:17:00,620
He was busy with the death anniversary, harvesting potatoes for the Feng family,

216
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,690
and making inquiries about our businesses.

217
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,210
Does he even have time to discuss music with Mr. Hu?

218
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,594
In current slang, my dad is a time management grandmaster.

219
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:15,392
Oh god, Uncle Xie.

220
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,320
That's not it.

221
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,070
What has this got to do with your dad?

222
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,818
He's a huge factor.

223
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:26,250
My dad adored Mr. Hu when he found out Mr. Hu was a musician.

224
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,690
Mr. Hu was delighted, so he performed his songs for my dad

225
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,010
and humbly asked for suggestions.

226
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,410
My father took it seriously.

227
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,198
He let others at the market listen to them and gathered opinions.

228
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,450
What happened after that?

229
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,380
After that, everyone offered their thoughts.

230
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,004
In a word, the songs were terrible.

231
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,140
No one appreciated them?

232
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,450
There were some,

233
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,650
but everyone's bound to have some criticism if you ask for it.

234
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,300
For example, the melody is good, but the lyrics suck.

235
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Too mushy. Sentimental and whiny. Nothing unique.

236
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,400
Has no market value, impossible to gain popularity, and not catchy enough.

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,250
It's better to learn to howl.

238
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,770
Were they all so professional?

239
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,590
Exactly.

240
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,900
As a result, my dad treats Mr. Hu very condescendingly.

241
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,060
He always lectures Mr. Hu about learning from Phoenix Legend.

242
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,010
Can't you restrain your dad?

243
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,580
I tried,

244
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,490
but my dad said this is to encourage improvement.

245
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,794
Besides, Xiao Hu is a modest guy.

246
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:27,518
Mr. Hu has been downgraded to Xiao Hu over time.

247
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,180
Okay, cut.

248
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,580
Cut? Well done.

249
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,770
My face is stiff from smiling.

250
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,481
This one was great. Your smile was wonderful,

251
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:52,580
but there are some minor issues.

252
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,124
Those grannies are a little distracting.

253
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:59,300
Can you ask them to sit farther back?

254
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,802
Okay, I will.

255
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:02,530
Give me a minute.

256
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,998
Hello, Grannies!

257
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,770
Damai.

258
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,550
Have some water.

259
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,690
Okay.

260
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,970
Feeling tired?

261
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,181
I'm not. I've only been sitting here.

262
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,900
I told you, filming is very interesting.

263
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,310
Believe me now?

264
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,710
It's fascinating.

265
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,620
I just think it's tough work to be out and about.

266
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,140
Not at all.

267
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,772
It's like a holiday.

268
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,170
When I just graduated from university,

269
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,730
I went to film a documentary in Guizhou with a crew.

270
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,690
The mountains there were really hard to trek.

271
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,190
Cars couldn't even get in.

272
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,702
Sometimes, I even followed those transporting equipment.

273
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,934
That's impressive.

274
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:43,280
I can't quit when everyone's working hard.

275
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,030
Xinxin is the truly impressive one.

276
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,730
I was on the university debate team.

277
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,380
She was two grades below me.

278
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,450
Her debate skills were unbeatable when she took the stage.

279
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,666
Her looks are adorable, but she's aggressive.

280
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,516
That's really quite astounding.

281
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:04,482
That's not what impressed me.

282
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:09,210
Xinxin used to stutter when speaking to others.

283
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,110
Sometimes, she'd even burst into tears from frustration.

284
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,500
She joined the debate team to change herself.

285
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,570
- Huang Xinxin used to stutter?
- Yeah.

286
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,680
How did she accomplish this?

287
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,250
Tons of practice.

288
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,060
She even looked in the mirror daily and told herself,

289
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,968
"I'm excellent. I can do this, and I will."

290
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,822
That's unbelievable.

291
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:36,100
This is the power of faith.

292
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,400
Once you believe you can change anything, change will follow.

293
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,798
Give it a shot.

294
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,501
<i>Thank you! Bye-bye!</i>

295
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,620
Sunzi, I did it! We're good!

296
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,170
Okay, let's shoot one more time.

297
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,501
One more time? Smile happily.

298
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,680
- Make sure its contagious.
- Okay. Happily.

299
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,974
<i>Same as earlier.</i>

300
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:58,570
<i>Come on.</i>

301
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,760
Jiahui, you're such a good cat.

302
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,480
Mr. Hu!

303
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,680
Mr. Hu, are you inside?

304
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,210
<i>Who is it?</i>

305
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,100
It's me, Xiaochun! Why didn't you answer my calls?

306
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,660
- Xiaochun?
- Open the door.

307
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,584
<i>My phone is on silent.</i>

308
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,050
What's wrong with you?

309
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,950
I just woke up and haven't tided up.

310
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,810
What's wrong?

311
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,320
- Please do me a favor.
- What is it?

312
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,140
The accordion teacher of Xiao Hu Lu's kindergarten left.

313
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,510
The children are singing without accompaniment now.

314
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,954
I was hoping you can teach a few music lessons.

315
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,820
I can't play the accordion.

316
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,360
It doesn't matter. They have an electronic keyboard at their school.

317
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,590
I can play that,

318
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,240
but I don't know how to teach children. Look for someone else.

319
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,100
Who else can I find?

320
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,970
You're the only professional singer I know.

321
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,650
It's easy to teach children. You sing and they echo you. That's all there is.

322
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,470
No can do.

323
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,100
You have to do this.

324
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,960
Take a bath and change your clothes. Clean yourself up.

325
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,011
Keep this in mind. Don't appear in gaudy clothes.

326
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,880
Don't taint the children with the smell of alcohol and tobacco.

327
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,970
I've already promised them.

328
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,490
You just have to prepare a children's song.

329
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,850
Be on time for class at 2:30 p.m.

330
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,092
No way. Goodbye.

331
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:39,930
Be on time for class at 2:30 p.m.

332
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,210
See you.

333
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,620
- Xiaochun!
- 2:30!

334
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,280
- No, I can't do it.
- 2:30!

335
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,782
What the heck?

336
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,730
Hello, everyone!

337
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,490
This is Mr. Hu, our music teacher for the day!

338
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,100
Everybody, follow me.

339
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,720
Hello, Mr. Hu.

340
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,868
<i>Hello, Mr. Hu!</i>

341
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:11,731
Hello.

342
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,110
Clap for him.

343
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:19,720
- Welcome, Mr. Hu.
<i>- Welcome, Mr. Hu.</i>

344
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,600
Mr. Hu, what song do you have for us?

345
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,740
"Rainbow Light." Have they learned it?

346
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,650
No.

347
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,970
Will it do?

348
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,090
- Sure.
- We'll go with that.

349
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,830
Sing for them first.

350
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,100
I have to sing first?

351
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,780
Do you want to hear Mr. Hu sing?

352
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,790
<i>Yes!</i>

353
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,058
Let's clap and encourage him!

354
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:39,508
I'll give it a shot.

367
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,960
<i>Yes!</i>

368
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,232
Let's clap for him.

369
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,346
Thank you.

370
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,780
Do you know?

371
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,860
Damai wrote a scene for you and your fiance in the promotional video.

372
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,660
What scene?

373
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,374
A seaside stroll at sunset with a horse.

374
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,602
That's more romantic than us spraying water in the sun.

375
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,956
What's your scene?

376
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:28,100
I'm not in the video.

377
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,158
But our courtyard will be featured.

378
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:33,100
I told Junzi that my face won't be on screen.

379
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,910
She'll just film my back and the tea brewing.

380
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,250
Wait.

381
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,554
It's Sunzi.

382
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:40,390
Sunzi.

383
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,400
Why is her name Sunzi?

384
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,900
I think it's because her mom is called Zhuzi.

385
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,964
Zhuzi? No wonder.

386
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,780
I'm done writing.

387
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,320
Take a look.

388
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,010
Will this do?

389
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,032
Nice, fantastic.

390
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,170
I'll send it.

391
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,416
Hello, Mom.

392
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,990
Dou, you sent so much ham again.

393
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,598
Your dad can't even carry them.

394
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:24,900
<i>Didn't you say the two pieces I sent over were tasty?</i>

395
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,310
These were salted by a friend's family.

396
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,250
Share some with my aunts.

397
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,370
Wonderful.

398
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,020
What are you doing now?

399
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,088
- I'm basking in the sun in the yard.
- Fourth aunt.

400
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,440
You're only in your thirties, but why are you like your grandma?

401
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,876
<i>[Hongdou]</i>
Why are you basking in the sun?

402
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,250
How is the new house?

403
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,790
When will you move over?

404
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,110
Everything's settled.

405
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,986
I'm thinking of leaving it befor another month.

406
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,340
We can move when you're back.

407
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,860
You can tidy up the things in your room.

408
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,730
<i>I don't know what you want to keep or throw away.</i>

409
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,550
Okay.

410
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,280
<i>By the way, don't send more things home.</i>

411
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,010
Got it.

412
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,412
The knife can't slice this.

413
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:07,766
Our cleaver doesn't work, either.

414
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:10,794
Why not borrow one from the neighbors?

415
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:11,650
Okay.

416
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,010
Dou, I have to hang up. Your dad and I will try to cut the ham.

417
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,580
That's all, Mom and Dad.

418
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,980
Bye.

419
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,650
Honey, why does she sound so pleased in her calls lately?

420
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,140
I dared not mention this,

421
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,060
but Dou used to be so listless.

422
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,650
She was so spiritless in everything she did.

423
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,720
Spiritless? What's with your vocabulary?

424
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,100
Shut up if you don't know how to talk properly.

425
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,410
It's just an adjective.

426
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,170
I don't want to hear such words.

427
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,870
What the hell?

428
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm bad with words, so please don't be angry.

429
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Where are you going?

430
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,964
To borrow a knife.

431
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,550
Someone who flares up so easily isn't cute at all.

432
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,630
So, you're cute? Are you Cutie Xu?

433
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,030
Yes, I'm Cutie Xu.

434
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,742
Cutie Xu is going to borrow a knife by motorcycle.

435
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,764
Are they moving out?

436
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,780
My sister bought them a house, and I paid for the renovations.

437
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,074
Daughters are still the best.

438
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,300
Exactly.

439
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,010
Girls are precious golden flowers.

440
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,250
Na Na, which boy has caught your eye?

441
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,380
Tell me.

442
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,020
I'll capture him with you at the next Double Third Festival.

443
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,960
Granny, are you only worried about me? What about Hongdou?

444
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,808
Hongdou already has A'Yao.

445
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,246
Hongdou,

446
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:36,982
there's no man with better character and looks than A'Yao here.

447
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,320
Granny, A'Yao and I are just friends.

448
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,610
I'll leave soon, so you still have to introduce promising ladies to him.

449
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,272
Are you ditching him?

450
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,904
Even if you ask me 100 times, my answer is the same.

451
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:56,620
We aren't lovers.

452
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,656
We have a working relationship.

453
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,266
A'Yao seems really fond of you.

454
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,710
Granny Xiuying, don't be upset.

455
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,016
Hongdou will leave, but I won't.

456
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,294
What about me?

457
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:12,860
You're gorgeous, too.

458
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,730
Right?

459
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,810
What are my chances?

460
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,380
How about Xia Xia?

461
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,930
Xia Xia?

462
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,558
He's just a little boy.

463
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,478
I like mature men like Chairman Xie.

464
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,630
What about me?

465
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,951
Chairman Xie, why are you here again?

466
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,500
I saw sour papaya on sale, so I bought some for you guys.

467
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,820
Were you badmouthing me?

468
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,550
I told Granny Xiuying I like mature men like you.

469
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,098
You have good taste.

470
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:45,310
Granny, have some sour papaya.

471
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,030
No, thanks.

472
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,780
Na Na, do you have cold brew tea?

473
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,280
Yes.

474
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,310
Have you ever eaten sour papaya?

475
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,010
Nope.

476
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,100
Have a taste.

477
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,140
Is it sour?

478
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,940
You'll know once you try it.

479
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,910
Thank you.

480
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,662
This one is particularly sour.

481
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:29,220
Don't you think it's sour?

482
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,330
So-so.

483
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,480
You're really good with sour food.

484
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,820
A girl of vinegar.

485
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,980
What?

486
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,650
It's nonsense.

487
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,580
Once the rain stopped, Zeqing went up the mountains

488
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,184
and collected a lot of mushrooms.

489
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,350
We're going to Qingdao soon.

490
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,140
I want to fry more termite mushrooms for Dayang and Xiao Xi.

491
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,440
These are for you. One packet each.

492
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,610
- Nice.
- Is it enough?

493
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,350
Of course. It's enough.

494
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,160
Who's going to tidy up the courtyard when you're away?

495
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,690
I've discussed this with A'Feng.

496
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,620
During my time in Qingdao, A'Feng is responsible for the courtyard's cleanliness.

497
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,380
She'll come over to the courtyard later,

498
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,880
and I'll teach her how to tidy the place.

499
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,352
It's very complex.

500
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:24,780
She'll be paid my wages of ¥50 a day.

501
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,840
All right. I'm off to meet A'Feng.

502
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,280
Okay.

503
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>The third one is aquamarine.</i>

504
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,200
<i>For some reason, it reminds me of the star sign of March.</i>

505
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,800
<i>Pisces.</i>

506
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
A'Feng!

507
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Chuchu!

508
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
Aunty Gui, you're here.

509
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Xiaoyue, do me a favor.

510
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,000
- Want to have some water?
- I'll get you some.

511
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,800
No, thanks.

512
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm not thirsty.

513
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Why did you make a trip here?

514
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm not off duty yet.

515
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
I know.

516
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
Zeqing went to the mountains to pick mushrooms.

517
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm here to share them with you.

518
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,200
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Aunty.

519
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
- Yours.
- Wonderful!

520
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,500
I can cook for my granny tonight.

521
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,600
- Isn't it fresh?
- Yes.

522
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Hotels vie for these at ridiculous prices,

523
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
but I don't need that money.

524
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,100
By the way, eat them when they're fresh.

525
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,600
They're delicious when fried with ham.

526
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Did Brother Dayang and Sister Xiao Xi give you red packets for your birthday again?

527
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
I don't just receive red packets on my birthday.

528
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,500
They give me red packets whenever it's a holiday!

529
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,700
Zeqing and I can't spend all that money.

530
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,300
Be it.

531
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,900
I'll save this money for my granddaughter. Right?

532
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,600
Aunty, you're so blessed.

533
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,500
Of course.

534
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
A'Feng.

535
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
Come on.

536
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,700
These two packets are for you.

537
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,800
They're filled with ganba mushrooms.

538
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,900
I'll get going. See you in the courtyard.

539
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,700
Come over when you get off work.

540
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,000
Got it.

541
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,800
- Aunty, take care.
- Okay.

542
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,600
I'm going to bring these to Hongdou and the rest.

543
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Aunty, take care.

544
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
Goodbye.

545
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,300
Yue. Chuchu.

546
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,700
You two can take my share.

547
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,000
Uncle Chang and I don't eat these.

548
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You don't?

549
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,300
We don't like the taste.

550
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,100
Take them.

551
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,700
Here's what we think.

552
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,800
Dayang and his wife are busy, so I can visit Qingdao.

553
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,200
I can take care of their children there.

554
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
That works, right?

555
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,200
The children can come here before they attend kindergarten.

556
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I'll still be the one looking after them. Right?

557
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,400
Dayang refused.

558
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,400
He said we've worked hard for all our lives.

559
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
We can't continue working.

560
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
We have to rest.

561
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
- Dayang is really filial.
- Of course.

562
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,900
Aunty A'Gui, are you certain these aren't toxic?

563
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,100
They're safe.

564
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,600
Xiao Xi is even more filial.

565
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,500
Xiao Xia even scolded her brother a while back.

566
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,000
She berated him for not calling me more often.

567
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Xiao Xi calls me every day.

568
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,500
How often do you call your parents?

569
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,200
Isn't this lurid bolete?

570
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,100
Yes.

571
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,700
You'll have to fry this for a long time.

572
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,000
A very long time.

573
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,200
Well... what's this?

574
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Na Na.

575
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm chatting with Hongdou.

576
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,800
Fine, these aren't toxic.

577
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I'll clean up these mushrooms.

578
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Hongdou, how often do you call your mom?

579
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
Once every few days.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,700
I don't have much to say anyway.

581
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,600
You have no time to call when you're busy.

582
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
You don't call when you're free.

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
When will you ever make the call?

584
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Will you only call when you're in trouble?

585
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,500
You'll drift apart.

586
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,200
That's true. Exactly.

587
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
I'm going to Qingdao.

588
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,500
I'm going to eat seafood.

589
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,400
I'll get you some water.

590
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
It's fine.

591
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,800
I think I should make more fresh flower cakes.

592
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll ask Aunty Baoping to make more cow's milk cheese

593
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,600
for the superiors and colleagues of Dayang and Xiao Xi.

594
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I also have to make more ham rice dumplings.

595
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Isn't Xiao Huang shooting a film?

596
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Come and make rice dumplings.

597
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,900
Get on camera.

598
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,200
I have a role.

599
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Really?

600
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
Great!

601
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,800
When it's finished, send it to your parents.

602
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
It's an honor.

603
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,900
Listen up.

604
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,200
I told Xiao Xi that I'll be an actress.

605
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,400
She didn't believe me.

606
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
She didn't.

607
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I'll show her. Let's see if she still doubts me once I send the video to her.

608
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,500
I never thought someone like me could be an actress.

609
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,200
- Indeed.
- Right?

610
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,400
You can get on camera, too.

611
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200

No photos allowed.

615
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,900
Please don't wander.

616
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,600

Na Na, hear me out.

633
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Can you show your face?

634
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,500
No way.

635
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,600
Why not?

636
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
Na Na is so pretty.

637
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
She's unwilling,

638
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,700
and her hands are elegant, too!

639
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,000
So natural and smooth.

640
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Yeah, I don't want to.

641
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,100
Okay, let's change our filming angle.

642
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,400
When you film, start farther downwards.

643
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes, start from her hands.

644
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
Pull back.

645
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,100
Then, zoom in.

646
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
That's right. Take it slow.

647
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,300
What's wrong? Do they look bad?

648
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,400
You asked me to dress them up a little.

649
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,300
They look great.

650
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Aunty Baoping.

651
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Take a photo for us.

652
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
- Shall we take a group photo?
- Okay.

653
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,500
Let's take a photo.

654
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,700
Come on.

655
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,000
Stand still.

656
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
Look over there.

657
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm taking the photo.

658
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
One, two, three.

659
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,600
Okay.

660
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,600
Wash your eyes clean.

661
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Remove the rouge, too.

662
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,800
Where are the other kids? Why aren't they here?

663
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,600
Let me call them.

664
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Use the soap. Wash with soap.

665
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,768
<i>A'Yao!</i>

666
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,600
- Come over.
- Hurry up!

667
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Wash your faces.

668
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Make way for them.

669
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
- Go over there.
- Step aside.

670
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,200
Okay, cut.

671
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Very good.

672
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Children, let's try again. Okay?

673
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,900
You're doing great! Let's try again.

674
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,800
Okay, go back there.

675
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,000
You're doing great! Keep it up!

676
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,600
Run over again!

677
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Okay!

678
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,800
When can we stop walking?

679
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,000
Until Sunzi gets the shot she wants.

680
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Don't look back.

681
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,400
Don't look at the camera.

682
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Walk closer to each other!

683
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Chat and laugh!

684
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Hold hands!

685
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,000
Let's do whatever Sunzi asks.

686
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,100
We'll be able to wrap up faster.

Yes, this is it. Keep this as it is.

693
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Say something.

694
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
The director asked us to chat and laugh.

695
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
Where are your cold jokes?

696
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,700
Hurry up and say a few.

697
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,600
Cold jokes?

♫ <i>We say goodbye</i> ♫

699
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
You didn't drink any alcohol.

700
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,700
Have you lost your wits?

701
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,500
It's too hot. Don't you think so?

702
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Is it hot?

703
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, your hands are sweaty.

704
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,600
How about just linking arms?

705
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,800
By the way, Old Ma called me.

706
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,000
He's being a dutiful son back at home.

707
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
He washes the clothes, mops the floor, and cooks.

708
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,800
His parents aren't treating him well though.

709
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,400
So, he doesn't have the guts to speak his mind.

710
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
He's actually daunted by someone.

♫ <i>The wind rejoice as flowers bloom</i> ♫

712
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,400
Why must Damai come up with a scene about lovers having a seaside stroll?

713
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
We even need a horse with us.

714
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,400
She likes such scenes.
