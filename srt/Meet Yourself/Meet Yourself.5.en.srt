<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,239
Granny, where are you going?

4
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,099
I'm going to wash my hair in the kitchen.

5
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,640
Why are you washing your hair in the kitchen?

6
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,760
I forgot to add water to the solar water heater yesterday.

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm worried you won't have enough water for your bath.

8
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,230
You can go ahead.

9
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,019
I'm fine with cold shower.

10
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,350
That won't do. You might catch a cold.

11
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm just washing my hair anyway.

12
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,590
Okay, fine. I'll help you wash your hair.

13
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,939
Did you drink?

14
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,039
Yes.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,400
I drank with Uncle Heshun.

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,400
Let's go.

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,300
Be careful.

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,060
<i>Lower your head.</i>

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,749
<i>Okay.</i>

20
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,370
<i>- Be careful.
- Okay.</i>

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,750
<i>Be careful.</i>

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,399
<i>It's fine.</i>

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,810
<i>I'm okay. Pour the water here.</i>

24
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,480
<i>Okay.</i>

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,940
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,910
<i>- Is the temperature okay?
- Yes.</i>

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,699
<i>The temperature is fine, right?</i>

28
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,630
<i>Yeah, it's perfect.</i>

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,429
<i>It's nice.</i>

30
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,310
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

31
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,540
<i>- It's wet now.
- Okay.</i>

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,080
<i>Be careful.</i>

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,329
<i>- Not bad.
- Okay.</i>

34
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,120
<i>- Pour it on this side.
- Okay.</i>

35
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,430
<i>Granny.</i>

36
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,430
<i>The water isn't hot at all.</i>

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,630
<i>There wasn't much sunshine today, so the water isn't hot.</i>

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,209
<i>Dry your hair then go to sleep.</i>

39
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>Got it.</i>

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,530
<i>Your hair isn't dry yet, and you wet the pillow!</i>

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,230
<i>How can I sleep now?</i>

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,100
<i>Sister, I'll show you something.</i>

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,380
<i>What is it?</i>

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,750
<i>Where did you get this bug?</i>

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,960
<i>This is a single-horned rhinoceros beetle!</i>

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,190
<i>Sun Wukong's story has a Single-Horned King!</i>

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,430
<i>It's a transformation of this!</i>

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,630
<i>That's Journey to the West.</i>

49
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,360
<i>Besides, there wasn't a single-horned king.</i>

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,310
<i>There were only the Golden Horn King and Silver Horn King!</i>

51
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,910
<i>Don't be a smart aleck and throw that away!</i>

52
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>No, I want to keep it as a pet.</i>

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,610
<i>Throw it away!</i>

54
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,000
<i>Give it to me!</i>

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
<i>Granny, help!</i>

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,340
<i>- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!</i>

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,750
<i>What is it this time?</i>

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,610
<i>Granny! Look at her!</i>

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,280
<i>She's keeping a bug on the bed!</i>

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,520
<i>It's not a bug!</i>

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,560
<i>It's a single-horned rhinoceros beetle I captured!</i>

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,240
<i>If you want to keep the bug, then don't sleep with me!</i>

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,850
<i>- Give it to me!
- No!</i>

64
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,080
<i>Give it to me!</i>

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,000
<i>- Granny!
- Enough, stop fighting!</i>

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,060
<i>Granny!</i>

67
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>Give it to me!</i>

68
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,120
<i>Granny!</i>

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,190
<i>Fine, fight all you want.</i>

70
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,149
<i>Keep fighting.</i>

71
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,960
<i>I'll leave you two be. Fight all you want.</i>

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>Just keep fighting.</i>

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
<i>Granny!</i>

74
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,559
<i>Why did you open your eyes again?</i>

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,110
<i>Sleep.</i>

76
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,770
<i>Granny, I don't want to go home.</i>

77
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,870
<i>Can I stay here?</i>

78
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,760
<i>You have dance lessons after summer vacation.</i>

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,700
<i>I don't want to attend dance lessons.</i>

80
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,820
<i>Well, do you want to learn to paint like your sister?</i>

81
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,650
<i>I don't want to learn to paint either.</i>

82
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,060
<i>What do you want to learn?</i>

83
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,950
<i>I want to raise chicks with you.</i>

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,680
<i>What do you want to be when you grow up?</i>

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,580
<i>Do you still want to rear chicks with me?</i>

86
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,120
<i>I'll open a grocery store.</i>

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>Open a grocery store?</i>

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,919
<i>I'll stock up on tons of ice creams and instant noodles.</i>

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,430
<i>I'll eat them every day.</i>

90
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,880
<i>If you eat your own products,</i>

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,230
<i>how can you make money?</i>

92
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,479
<i>I can.</i>

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>I'll open a huge supermarket.</i>

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,360
<i>Then, I'll buy you roast chicken when I make money.</i>

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,270
<i>Okay.</i>

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,380
<i>to set up a huge supermarket and earns tons of money.</i>

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,000
<i>I'll wait for your roast chicken.</i>

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,010
<i>Go to sleep, sweetie.</i>

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,060
<i>It's feels amazing.</i>

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,420
- Damai.
- What's wrong?

102
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,120
Can I borrow your phone?

103
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,310
Here you go. There's no passcode.

104
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,040
Thanks.

105
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,680
Who the heck is this?

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,990
Exactly. Hello? Who is it?

107
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,550
<i>Hello, Mom.</i>

108
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,990
Dou!

109
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,820
What's wrong? It's so late in the night.

110
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,460
- What's going on?
- Did something happen?

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,350
Hongdou called me in the middle of the night.

112
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,480
I was scared out of my wits.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,290
In the end, she just asked me to visit you guys

114
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,210
and buy you roast chicken.

115
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,940
Did her granny appear in her dreams?

116
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,200
The both of us are much closer to her.

117
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,870
Why would she appear in Hongdou's dream?

118
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,020
Grandparents love their grandchildren more.

119
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,950
That's right.

120
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,260
What's Hongmi doing recently?

121
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,120
She's taking care of Lingdang.

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,660
Lingdang is learning Chinese chess now.

123
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,000
Wasn't she learning the piano?

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,570
She's learning chess now that she's done with piano.

125
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,460
Kexin is pregnant now.

126
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,029
She's already started antenatal training.

127
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,690
She reads poems to her belly every day.

128
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,010
Her mother-in-law also bought some English books for her.

129
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,100
Who can even understand a word of that?

130
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,860
Time flies so quickly, generation after generation.

131
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,900
- That's right.
- You're going to be a granny soon.

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,800
Exactly.

133
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,390
You're up?

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,930
Do you know how to make a cat toy?

135
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,200
I learned it from the internet.

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,850
I'm just mimicking what I saw, so it's a little ugly.

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,770
Thanks.

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,150
I'm coming.

139
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,870
I'll be there right away.

140
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,080
Hongdou!

141
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,629
Damai!

142
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,360
Damai, you've been here for a month,

143
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,100
but we've only met twice.

144
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,650
You're free, right? Come and hang out with me. Let's make flower cakes.

145
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,270
Those snacks with roses in them?

146
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,070
Yes, and cow's milk cheese.

147
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,949
- I bet you haven't heard of these before. Let's go.
- Okay!

148
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,470
You guys go ahead. I'll stay here.

149
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,149
Lassie,

150
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,250
you coop yourself up in your room after you arrived and don't show your face.

151
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,170
Look at your complexion. You look so frail!

152
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,600
You have to take a stroll from time to time.

153
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,020
- Let's go.
- I won't go.

154
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,260
- I'm useless.
- Just come with us.

155
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,719
It's very simple. You'll pick it up immediately.

156
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,519
Jiahui, be good and stay home.

157
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,690
I'm really useless.

158
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,020
You'll master it right away! It's very simple!

159
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,450
Let's go!

160
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,640
There are flower cakes and cheese.

161
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,050
Finally, some peace and quiet.

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,020
Jiahui.

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,220
I share your sentiments.

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,850
You like quiet places too, don't you?

165
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,750
We're the same.

166
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,500
What a cute cat,

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,990
but it must be uncomfortable to have this on your neck.

168
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,980
I'll take it off for you.

169
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,450
Lay here.

170
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,630
I'll show you the Eight Silken Movements exercise.

171
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,060
Baoping, we're here!

172
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,720
I even brought helpers over.

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,909
The guests at the courtyard.

174
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,249
- This is Xiaochun's mom, Aunty Baoping.
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:57,130
This is Hongdou and Damai.

176
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,510
I know you two.

177
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,910
A'Yao told me about you guys.

178
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,260
- I'll make some tea for you.
- It's fine. We aren't thirsty.

179
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,750
What are you making?

180
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm making cow's cheese milk.

181
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,030
Cow's cheese milk?

182
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,740
Is it the same as the fried cheese sold on the streets?

183
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,959
That's right.

184
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,749
Here, have a taste.

185
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,150
It tastes like ordinary cheese.

187
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,110
In the past, we'd sell these because we were poor.

188
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,440
We seldom make them now.

189
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,719
We used to hang them all over the yard if we made too much.

190
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,030
Aunty Baoping, you're impressive.

191
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,400
It's nothing. I was just raising the family.

192
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,920
All done.

193
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
Let's get to work.

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,250
Do you need help?

195
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
Wash your hands first. Meet me in the kitchen.

196
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,720
Are you using fresh roses?

197
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,790
Yes.

198
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,940
Here you go.

199
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,150
Have a whiff. Isn't it fragrant?

200
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,239
There are two ways to making the fillings for flower cakes.

201
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,840
One way is to make rose jam a week in advance

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,790
and fill up the cakes.

203
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,220
The other way is to make fresh flower cakes.

204
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,739
There are lard oil, paste powder, and sugar in it.

205
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:12,790
We mix everything together.

206
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,480
Right now, I'm going to mix them thoroughly.

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,430
Are you making flower cakes and cheese for a celebration?

208
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,700
Nope.

209
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,289
Aunty Baoping's son, Xia Xia, is meeting a friend in Shanghai.

210
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,150
Baoping wants to make some local delicacies

211
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,420
for his son's Shanghainese friend to try.

212
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,270
My children, Dayang and Xiao Xi, haven't been home in ages.

213
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,620
So, I'll make extras to send to them.

214
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,550
Such food can be bought,

215
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,980
but handmade ones taste like home.

216
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,669
Mix everything together first.

217
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,130
Then, we can use them as fillings.

218
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,440
Should I leave early if I want to board a boat at Huangpu River?

219
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,730
Is there anything yummy there? Are they expensive?

220
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,650
I don't know.

221
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,620
Haven't you been on that boat?

222
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,710
I have, but as a child. I've already forgotten everything.

223
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,920
Are you sure you're from Shanghai?

224
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,800
Should I show you my ID card?

225
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,389
No, thanks.

226
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,340
You're welcome.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,290
I said you're welcome.

228
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,100
Have you eaten this waffle?

229
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,910
I don't know. Probably not.

230
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,840
Why are you so clueless?

231
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,710
My Shanghainese friend knows all the best places.

232
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,900
Well, ask him. Don't come to me.

233
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,800
He's working now, so I feel bad bothering him.

234
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,360
Don't you feel bad bothering me?

235
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,160
<i>[Brother Kaiwen (Yang Kaiwen)]</i>

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,900
<i>[The principal balance is ¥1000, so the profit is ¥300. That should be enough to treat your friend to a meal.]</i>

237
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
<i>[Wow, that's a lot. Thanks, bro.]</i>

238
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>[That isn't much. You can open an account yourself, since keeping cash is just a waste. I'll help you make money.]</i>

239
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,389
Na Na.

240
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,740
Do you buy stocks?

241
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,900
No, I buy trade funds.

242
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,870
Does it make money?

243
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,150
It's hard to say.

244
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,500
The market is good recently, so I earned some money.

245
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,880
Are you planning to buy stocks?

246
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,780
Do you think I can?

247
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,040
No way. It's too risky.

248
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,030
A clueless guy like you

249
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,840
will be gobbled up by them the moment you enter the market.

250
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,239
Xie Xiaoxia.

251
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,880
- Sister.
- You're slacking here again, aren't you?

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,450
You're about to leave soon.

253
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,490
- Can't you help Mom with some work?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,390
Don't just say that. I'll wallop you if you do this again.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,500
His heart is no longer here.

256
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,980
It's useless to scold him.

257
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,350
When can my brother become sensible?

258
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,400
A drama's male lead said this.

259
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,050
People turn into adults in a snap.

260
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,570
A snap?

261
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,050
When's that?

262
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,290
It's a moment only known to you and nobody else.

263
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,140
That's what he said.

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,719
Well, I reckon my brother will grow up

265
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,399
when he passes away and the coffin cover slams down over him.

266
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,159
What's with that nonsense?

267
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,350
You're so mean.

268
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,540
Are you sure you're his sister?

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,190
- A'Peng.
- Hey!

270
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,269
Did you see A'Yuan?

271
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,140
He is in the stables.

272
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,640
Take care of him.

273
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Don't worry.

274
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,530
Uncle Zeqing.

275
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,080
Did you see A'Yuan?

276
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,999
He said he has a stomach ache, so I let him go home.

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,349
Did something happen?

278
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,620
It's nothing. You can get on with your work.

279
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
Hello, Aunty.

280
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,140
It's me.

281
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,879
I'm at the horse ranch.

282
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,510
A'Yuan isn't here. I guess he went home.

283
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,479
<i>What's going on?</i>

284
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
<i>Your dad sent him to the countryside to work and become sensible.</i>

285
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,589
<i>He's supposed to come running back to school after experiencing such labor.</i>

286
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,580
<i>Why is he enjoying life now?</i>

287
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,679
You were the ones who set him free.

288
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,140
I can do nothing about it.

289
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,970
<i>As his brother, you can hit him if he's naughty.</i>

290
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,069
Hit him?

291
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,340
If I hurt him, you'll be upset.

292
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,959
<i>Well, don't stop your granny.</i>

293
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,070
<i>Let your granny hit him.</i>

294
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,380
Things aren't that severe.

295
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,199
If he really doesn't want to go back,

296
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:07,190
I'll find a school for him here in Dali.

297
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,110
Don't worry.

298
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,160
Okay. Bye.

299
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,740

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,610
I'll add the sugar. Mix it with both hands.

325
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,920
♫ <i>Make a little wish and pray</i> ♫

326
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,060
♫ Maybe things will go your way<i> ♫</i>

327
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,820
Here it is!

328
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,640
Come on.

329
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,999
Be careful. It's hot.

330
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,630
Don't touch the tray.

331
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,310
Have a taste.

332
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,031
Baoping!

333
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,350
Your oven isn't good.

334
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,640
I bet it's cheap.

335
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,040
Look, it's too shabby.

336
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,700
This isn't crispy at all!

337
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,549
Next time, bake at my house.

338
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,269
We can use the huge oven Xiao Xi bought for me.

339
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,190
It's sturdy and has many functions.

340
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,269
Enough.

341
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,070
You like everything that Xiao Xi buys for you.

342
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,760
You're not wrong.

343
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,790
Is it delicious?

344
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,980
Yes.

345
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,009
It tastes great.

346
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,380
It'll be even more delicious with a better oven.

347
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,839
Hongdou, hand this to A'Yao.

348
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,000
Granny likes to eat this.

349
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Okay, no problem.

350
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,830
Aunty Baoping, can you give me the few pieces I made?

351
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,069
No problem.

352
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,270
When it's dry, I'll pack them for you.

353
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,680
You can let your parents have a taste.

354
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,750
Thanks.

355
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,550
Aunty Baoping, we only ate and took these gifts without helping much.

356
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,140
I'm happy to have you here.

357
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,770
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

358
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,940
- Goodbye.
- Watch your step.

359
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,550
- Okay.
- Bye-bye, Aunty Baoping.

360
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,159
Shower! Shower! A nice shower!

361
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,440
My dear brother.

362
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,180
What are we eating tonight?

363
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,000
What are we eating?

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,480
- Braised chicken.
- Braised chicken!

365
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
Where's Granny?

366
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,590
She went to visit others.

367
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,350
Smells amazing!

368
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,850
Brother, where's the rice?

369
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,150
I'm heating the leftover rice from lunch.

370
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,800
Come over here first.

371
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,690
I need to talk to you.

372
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,490
Here we go again.

373
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,540
Stop staring at me and talk.

374
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,930
I asked a friend in the Old Town about school—

375
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,890
I won't go!

376
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,960
I won't go even if you beat me to death!

377
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,479
<i>I'm not going!</i>

378
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,679
<i>Stop inquiring!</i>

379
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,820
<i>I suck at studying! Transferring schools won't make a difference!</i>

380
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,879
<i>I'll still be mocked!</i>

381
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,310
<i>Well, go back to Kunming then.</i>

382
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,649
<i>At least finish high school.</i>

383
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>I won‘t! You can't make me go!</i>

384
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,549
It's no big deal.

385
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,639
Being so whiny is even more embarrassing!

386
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,679
I bet they'll laugh at me in secret!

387
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,349
I've already become the laughing stock of the whole school!

388
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,000
High school is so stressful. They don't have time to be mocking you.

389
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,100
Do you think you're some celebrity?

390
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,959
It's easy for you to blabber.

391
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,620
My reputation is already in tatters now!

392
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,829
I'd rather die than go back to Kunming!

393
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,720
You'd rather die?

394
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,070
You just pooped in your pants during class because of a stomach ache.

395
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,029
Xie Zhiyao!

396
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,029
If you talk about it again, I'll kill myself!

397
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,720
Well, kill yourself after you finish high school!

398
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,480
Aunty Baoping asked me to bring over flower cakes.

399
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,870
I'll get going now.

400
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,330
Wait! You can't go!

401
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,789
Xie Zhiyuan, what are you doing?

402
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,789
Let go of her.

403
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,239
No, I won't!

404
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,399
I won't leave.

405
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,760
Are you okay? You aren't injured, are you?

406
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,210
Why are you laughing?

407
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,829
Can't people laugh after your pooping incident?

408
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,200
Stop talking about it!

409
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,720
Talk to him nicely.

410
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,650
Don't hit him.

411
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,239
She can't leave.

412
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,160
What if she blabbers and ruins my reputation?

413
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,550
Who do you think you are?

414
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,400
Ruin your reputation? Do you even have that?

415
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,510
- Why don't I...
- Don't worry.

416
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,880
I won't tell a soul.

417
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,960
I don't trust you.

418
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,959
Fine.

419
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,760
Tell me what you want. I'll go along with your wishes.

420
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
Well...

421
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,270
What are you doing?

422
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,919
Have you had dinner?

423
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,750
Not yet.

424
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,439
Let's eat together.

425
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,959
I brought this braised chicken over from Aunty Hua's home.

426
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,830
That explains the fragrance.

427
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,110
It's my lucky day.

428
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,780
- Take a seat. I'll get the rice.
- Okay.

429
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,100
I'm going to take some rice.

430
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,720
I won't leave.

431
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,510
I'll have dinner here.

432
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,820
Isn't Granny home today?

433
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,440
Let's have dinner.

434
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,930
It's still warm.

435
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,720
Aren't we waiting for Granny?

436
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,960
She went out for a stroll.

437
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,110
I'll pick her up later.

438
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,680
Okay.

439
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,740
Did Aunty A'Gui drag you to be her helper?

440
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,340
She was probably worried that Damai and I were bored, so she invited us over.

441
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,590
Was it fun?

442
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,380
Yes.

443
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,639
Get Aunty Baoping bring you to the warehouse.

444
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,679
The warehouse? Where's that?

445
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,730
It's her workplace. An e-commerce warehouse.

446
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,580
Have you packed products before?

447
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,150
Nope.

448
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,620
Don't ask me to join in labor.

449
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,970
Fine. I'll look for you when there's food.

450
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,920
Does it taste good?

451
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,269
The chicken is so tender.

452
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,770
It's delicious.

453
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,109
At such a time,

454
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,140
a cup of cherry wine that Granny made

455
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,069
would be perfect.

456
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,920
Cherry wine?

457
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,090
Go.

458
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,680
Fetch the wine on the kitchen shelf.

459
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,829
Go on.

460
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,390
Why are you in a daze?

461
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,000
Half a cup is enough.

462
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,550
Although this wine is sweet, it contains a lot of alcohol.

463
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,250
Drink it slowly.

464
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,670
The cherry taste is so intense.

465
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,159
Wild cherries are sour when eaten,

466
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,270
but they're great for making wine.

467
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,160
Keep it a secret. You promised me.

468
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,000
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

469
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,780
Sorry. He's a reckless boy. Please forgive him.

470
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,719
It's nothing.

471
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,549
Actually, I feel sorry for him.

472
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,720
You feel sorry for him?

473
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,310
How about feeling sorry for me?

474
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,309
He's torturing me to death.

475
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,270
That's true.

476
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,500
Teenagers think their self-esteem is the world at sixteen or seventeen.

477
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
Besides, he humiliated himself so terribly in class.

478
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,360
What if he has a girl he likes?

479
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,940
I understand why he wants to quit school.

480
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,959
He wants to quit school after such a small setback.

481
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,639
He has a long life ahead of him.

482
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,719
What if he encounters something even more humiliating?

483
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,680
He won't understand your reasoning now.

484
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,440
Do you have siblings?

485
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,320
Yeah, I have an elder sister.

486
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,940
She's five years old than me, and her child is in kindergarten.

487
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,159
Five years older?

488
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,439
That's much better.

489
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,390
How is that better?

490
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,050
Do you quarrel, too?

491
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,509
How are sibling quarrels related to age?

492
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,680
Well, what's the crux?

493
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,740
Personalities.

494
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,920
Doesn't that mean you'll fight for life?

495
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,390
Be careful.

496

♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫

502
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,490
You're back?

503
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,530
What did Mi buy again?

504
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,580
Dou sent this to us.

505
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,750
What is it?

506
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,150
I'm guessing Yunnan's delicacies.

507
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,920
Let me have a look.

508
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,309
We've bought them before.

509
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,590
Neither of us enjoy such things.

510
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,749
Tell the kids to stop wasting money.

511
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,640
You don't like such things?

512
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
You were gorging yourself on them.

513
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,240
If neither of us eats the food, it'll go to waste.

514
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,860
You even lied about how delicious it was.

515
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,239
That's why they're sending more over.

516
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Since they've already spent the money to buy it,

517
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,030
they'll be upset if we say the food tastes terrible.

518
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,110
Do you know what this is?

519
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,680
It's a lack of EQ.

520
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,199
Fine, your EQ is high.

521
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,880
I'll say all the mean stuff

522
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,310
and you can be the good guy.

523
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,879
"Mom,

524
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,310
I went to a local lady's home

525
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,830
and made these flower cakes and rose jam myself.

526
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,120
Have a taste."

527
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,919
Dou made these herself!

528
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Amazing.

529
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,239
Hold on!

530
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,300
I'll call her and ask if we need to heat them up.

531
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,639
<i>Hello.</i>

532
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,550
<i>The phone you dialed had been turned off.</i>

533
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,570
Her phone isn't fixed yet.

534
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,770
It's so annoying.

535
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Hello.

536
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
<i>- Mi.</i>
- Mom.

537
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,400
Can I ask you something?

538
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Do we need to heat up flower cakes before eating them?

539
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Did Xu Hongdou send them to you?

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, we just received them.

541
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,400
<i>Mom, here's a friendly reminder.</i>

542
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
<i>Those are packed with sugar.</i>

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
<i>During your recent health checkup with Dad,</i>

544
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,600
didn't the doctor warm you about high blood sugar?

545
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Don't eat too many.

546
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
Share them with the neighbors.

547
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,000
We know.

548
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,300
Tell me whether they need to be heated up.

549
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
<i>It's fine either way.</i>

550
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
She also sent some to me.

551
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,400
What the heck is up with her?

552
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Why did she buy so many flower cakes?

553
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
<i>Too much sugar is unhealthy.</i>

554
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,400
She didn't buy these. She made them herself.

555
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,200
Didn't you receive a card in yours?

556
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>I have a card she wrote.</i>

557
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,000
She's really made of time, isn't she?

558
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Mom, I still need to work.

559
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

560
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,000
It's delicious. Have a bite.

561
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,800
Amazing.

562
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I'll make some tea.

563
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Don't eat too many.

564
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,100
There are roses in it.

565
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,900
- Manager Xu.
- Manager Xu.

566
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,600
Manager Xu.

567
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
Are there only these two left?

568
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,200
They took a box with them for the meeting upstairs.

569
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,230
<i>[Xu Hongmi, I made these rose cakes and flower jam myself.]</i>

570
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,100
<i>[They're completely organic and great for your health. Enjoy them with gratitude in your heart.]</i>

571
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,400
Does it taste good?

572
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,100
- Of course!
- It's delicious!

573
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,700
My sister made them herself.

574
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,200
<i>Nanxing's mom and dad, I made the flower cakes myself.</i>

575
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
<i>Put it in the fridge if you can't finish them.</i>

576
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>Please take care.</i>

577
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,200
<i>I'll visit you soon.</i>

578
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,600
She knows how to make flower cakes?

579
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,400
Let's try them.

580
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
It looks delicious.

581
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Tastes great.

582
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
It's delicious.

583
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,200
You scared me.

584
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,800
What are you doing here?

585
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm here to look for my jeans.

586
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,300
The ones that I often wear.

587
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,000
I think they might be in your sister's room.

588
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Jeans look the same.

589
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,700
I can't tell them apart.

590
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,800
I've dyed and sent them to be framed.

591
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,400
You can put them on sale online next week.

592
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,500
Great.

593
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,000
A'Yao!

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,200
- Yeah?
- A'Yao.

595
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
Help me out.

596
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,800
That foreigner can't understand me.

597
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't you know English?

598
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,900
Explain to him.

599
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,800
- Help me teach him.
- Okay.

600
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
What do you want to say?

601
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,500
Over here. He needs to tie this tightly.

602
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,200
His is too loose.

603
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,600
The dye will be ugly if it's tied loosely.

604
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,000
Granny said that clothes needs to be tighter.

605
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,300
If not, the dyeing effect won't be good.

606
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,200
I know Mandarin, but I didn't understand what she said.

607
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Sorry, she speaks a dialect.

608
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Okay.

609
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
What did you tell him?

610
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
He said he can't understand you.

611
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,600
You don't need to speak to him either. Just use gestures.

612
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Don't leave.

613
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,200
If you leave, I'll be scared.

614
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
What's there to be scared of?

615
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm afraid he'll speak to me.

616
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,500
He won't speak to you anymore.

617
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,200
Don't go. Just sit here.

618
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
Granny, I’m busy.

619
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,400
I need to go to the embroidery workshop.

620
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Don't go. Sit here.

621
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Granny Zhao, why are you ordering the boss around?

622
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
He's the boss?

623
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Yes, he's our boss.

624
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
- You can just use gestures.
- That's right. He also owns a horse ranch.

625
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,200
You can ride horses there.

626
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Where is it?

627
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,500
There are brochures on the table. There's a map on it.

628
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,600
You can check out where you want to go.

629
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
Sisters and Aunties, I really have to leave.

630
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
Xiaolan and Gezi went to Xinjiang.

631
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Call me if you need anything.

632
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
Don't go!

633
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,200
Granny, he's busy.

634
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I want to visit the ranch.

635
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
Okay.

636
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
43.5.

637
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,100
<i>[Cooler]</i>
What are you doing? Put it down gently.

638
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,600
We always unload goods like this.

639
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
- It's fine.
- It's fine?

640
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,000
Customers will demand compensation if the products are damaged.

641
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Are you going to fork out the money?

642
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,400
Ask the packers to check carefully.

643
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,100
If they're bruised, take them out immediately.

644
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,000
Be gentle.

645
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Got it.

646
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,700
Chuchu, keep an eye on them.

647
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,300
Got it, Manager.

648
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Aunty, if you see oranges that don't look fresh,

649
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
take them out immediately.

650
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Don't put them in.

651
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,700
Okay.

652
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,800
How can you talk to Dabin like that?

653
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,300
What did I do?

654
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,000
According to seniority, you should address him as uncle.

655
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,600
Be polite.

656
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Seniority?

657
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,500
He's just a young lad in his early twenties.

658
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,400
Why can't I nag at him if he's working so carelessly? I'm already being nice.

659
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,700
We share the same village.

660
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,000
Stop saying that.

661
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
So what if we're from the same village?

662
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
This is work.

663
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,500
- Xiaochun.
- Mom.

664
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm the manager here.

665
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Little Fatty.

666
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,900
Aunty E.

667
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,400
Say "Manager".

668
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,300
That's right. Our respected manager.

669
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,200
Okay.

670
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,800
Manager.

671
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Have you heard about A'Yuan?

672
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,700
A'Yuan? What happened?

673
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,200
What's going on?

674
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,500
Xu Hongdou! Xu Hongdou!

675
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,200
Xu Hongdou, show yourself!

676
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,500
Xu Hongdou! Xu Hongdou!

677
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Hongdou went out.

678
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,100
Why are you looking for her?

679
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
What a reckless boy.

680
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,900
Where was I?

681
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
<i>[Mom: W can't I contact you?][Hasn't it been fixed yet?][I went to the grave yesterday and bought the roast chicken.</i>

682
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,600
<i>[Haven't you gotten your phone fixed?]
[Just buy a new one if it can't be fixed.]
[We received the flower cakes. Text me when your phone is fixed.]</i>

683
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
<i>[Xing]</i>

684
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
Are there any issues?

685
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,700
It's working fine.

686
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,100
- Where should I scan to pay?
- ¥1380.

687
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,700
Scan here.

688
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
<i>Xu Hongdou!</i>

689
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,600
<i>You promised me to keep it a secret!</i>

690
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,300
<i>You liar!</i>

691
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,700
<i>[Ordinary World by Lu Yao]</i>

692
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
Hello.

693
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,800
Xu Hongdou?

694
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,200
A'Yuan called you?

695
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,300
Where did he get your number?

696
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm at the horse ranch.
