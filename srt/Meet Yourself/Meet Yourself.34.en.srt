00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,470
<i>[Meet Yourself]</i>

2
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,930
<i>[Episode 34]</i>

3
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,800
You... found out?

4
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,340
I used to be a live streamer.

5
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,650
I sang.

6
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,690
I loved to cover classic Hong Kong and Taiwan songs.

7
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,210
You're a great singer.

8
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,380
On my birthday,

9
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,059
I decided to donate all the proceeds of my live streaming

10
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:32,340
to a sick fan who was struggling with money.

11
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,350
Since it was my birthday, my earnings were higher than usual.

12
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,460
I made about ¥30,000.

13
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,840
I added my own money to make it ¥50,000 and donated the money to the fan.

14
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,710
When the donation sum was announced,

15
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,450
someone said the amount I donated was too little.

16
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,099
They said the proceeds that day must've exceeded ¥30,000.

17
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,930
I explained that a share of the money belonged to the platform,

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,460
but no one believed me.

19
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,990
Everyone started criticizing me incessantly.

20
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,050
After that, the platform issued a proof

21
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,629
stating that the earnings that day were indeed around ¥30,000.

22
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,830
I thought things would be fine with a clear explanation,

23
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,700
but some people got even more riled up.

24
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:40,029
They started digging up the brands of my clothes and accessories.

25
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:44,699
They said I only donated an amount equivalent to a piece of my clothes.

26
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,480
They said...

27
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,710
I spent this small amount of money

28
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,690
to buy the image of a kind-hearted person.

29
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,760
There were even more ridiculous incidents after this.

30
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,190
Someone claimed to be my classmate

31
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,160
and stepped forward to spill the beans.

32
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,190
They said I dated rich boyfriends one after another in school.

33
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,680
Soon after,

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,310
my phone number and address

35
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,680
were spilled on the internet.

36
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,060
At that time,

37
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,549
people called me every day to harass me.

38
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:45,310
They rang the intercom of my house.

39
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,090
The rumors became even more horrible.

40
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,620
I didn't know what to do at that time.

41
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,250
I wanted to explain myself, but I didn't know how to.

42
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,389
Those people only chose to believe what they wanted to believe.

43
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,350
During that time,

44
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,890
even my colleagues and peers started avoiding me.

45
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,720
You must've felt so aggrieved.

46
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,450
It must've been terrifying.

47
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,870
At that time, I thought to myself...

48
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,640
that so much time has passed.

49
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,870
I should be able to get over it.

50
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,890
When I realized people were starting to recognize me...

51
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,770
and those gazes were focused on me again...

52
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,670
Hongdou,

53
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm not that brave.

54
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,540
Sometimes, people encounter stumbling blocks.

55
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,340
However, it's just like falling sick out of the blue.

56
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,680
This isn't your fault.

57
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,650
Cuo Bazi, slow down!

58
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,890
Run slowly.

59
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,360
Don't run so fast! Slow down!

60
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,890
<i>What brings you here?</i>

61
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,020
She hasn't eaten properly for days.

62
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,260
She was busy a while back, so she had to cram food down her throat.

63
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,680
Lately, she's been feeling down and without an appetite.

64
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,389
You needn't worry about me. Aren't I eating now?

65
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,999
Damai, now that you're back,

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,419
you need to keep an eye on her for me and make sure she finishes her food.

67
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,450
No problem, leave it to me.

68
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,909
Don't be so dramatic. I'm fine.

69
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,389
You've just shoved it out of your mind for now. That's why you feel all right.

70
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,709
If we leave you alone, what will we do if you're hurt?

71
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,919
You don't have to worry about me all the time.

72
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,850
I'm really fine. I survived back then anyway.

73
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,340
Besides, you have your own tasks to deal with.

74
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,510
I can't help you, but I can't add to your troubles.

75
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,400
Only friends bother each other.

76
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,970
No one would bother a stranger.

77
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,670
Just rest and relax for a bit.

78
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,049
Stay here with Damai. Don't think about anything. Okay?

79
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,870
Eat up.

80
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,360
Why did you bring Cuo Bazi with you?

81
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,340
Na Na likes Cuo Bazi.

82
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,489
Besides, dogs feel suffocated in cities. They can't run about freely.

83
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:36,249
If I pass the dog to my parents, I'm afraid they can't keep it in control when taking it on walks.

84
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,970
So, I brought it here.

85
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,919
Whose dog is this? It's so adorable.

86
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,930
- Mr. Ma!
- Hey!

87
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,640
Mr. Ma!

88
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,190
Damai! When did you get back?

89
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,190
I just arrived.

90
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,590
You look slimmer.

91
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,140
I've put on five catties.

92
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,500
Mr. Ma, why did you suddenly come back?

93
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,850
I went to survey the red rose farm.

94
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,120
So, I decided to visit you guys.

95
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,060
Na Na, how're you doing?

96
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,419
I feel fine. Don't worry about me.

97
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,320
That's great.

98
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,940
Since Damai is back, have fun together.

99
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,399
- I'll go back to my room to tidy up my stuff. Let's have tea in the yard later.
- Sure!

100
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,839
- Mr. Ma!
- Yeah?
- Mr. Ma!

101
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,539
What a fat dog! Look how round you are!

102
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,959
Hey, what's going on?

103
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,799
Didn't I tell you I'd pick you up at the intersection? Why did you come here on your own?

104
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,129
What's wrong with you? I'm not a child who needs to go to the toilet with a buddy.

105
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,569
Mai Mai! I missed you so much!

106
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,379
- Come here.
- Give me a hug.

107
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,970
You gained some weight.

108
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,379
- Did you miss me?
- Nope.

109
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,789
- I'll go unpack my luggage.
- Hold on.

110
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:01,059
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it?

111
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,329
You're a boss now. Shouldn't you treat us to a meal?

112
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,720
Old Hu, I heard that you're dating.

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,109
What are you talking about? I don't get it.

114
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,369
Well, I'll help him unpack his luggage.

115
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,080
There's no rush. Don't worry. Tell me the details first.

116
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,910
Do you think that's appropriate for you to hear?

117
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,140
I have to know so I can give you some advice.

118
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,599
- How's that?
- Why is it so heavy?

119
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,670
Do you have a picture? Let me see.

120
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,280
Have some corn.

121
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,549
<i>If you guys have any favorite songs, you can share them with me.</i>

122
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,440
<i>After I learn them, I'll cover them for you.</i>

123
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,249
<i>If you have any songs that you want to listen to, you can leave comments for me.</i>

124
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,530
<i>"Drifitng Together".</i>

125
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,700
<i>How old are you? Why do you know this song?</i>

126
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,550
<i>Are you testing me?</i>

127
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,220
<i>The song was released before I was born.</i>

128
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,969
<i>Thank you, everyone. Thank you for supporting me.</i>

129
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,700
Eat up.

130
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,600
<i>Ukulele?</i>

131
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,980
<i>I've been practicing.</i>

132
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,330
<i>Once I master it, I'll perform for you guys.</i>

133
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,130
Got it.

134
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,079
<i>The next song is "Drifting Together."</i>

135
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,959
<i>If you like it, you can search for it online.</i>

136
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,860
<i>I dedicate this song to all of you.</i>

137
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,020
Who's calling?

138
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,590
Probably another harassment call.

139
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,660
Don't answer.

140
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,600
Hello?

141
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,570
Say who you are and what you want.

142
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,780
Just hang up.

143
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,630
A fan?

144
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,650
Well, she's all right.

145
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,590
How did you get this phone number?

146
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,830
Okay. I'll tell her. Don't worry.

147
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,120
We're Na Na's friends.

148
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,020
Sure, goodbye.

149
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,180
A fan?

150
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,080
He said he supports Na Na

151
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,700
and she didn't do anything wrong.

152
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,420
He wants her life to return to normal soon.

153
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,510
Did he tell you how he got my number?

154
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,789
The WeChat account you use for the cafe

155
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,389
is clearly your phone number. Change it.

156
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,900
No wonder.

157
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,839
With just a few harassment calls, my blood pressure has shot up.

158
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,819
How did Na Na survive this?

159
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,890
What happened to Sister Na Na?

160
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,869
It's nothing. She's fine. Eat your food.

161
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:44,290
Here you go. Have more of this.

162
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,460
Eat more.

163
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,420
Finish your food.

164
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,129
If you throw it in like this, aren't you afraid they will pop?

165
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,380
They won't.

166
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,910
Why are you so timid?

167
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,050
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt.

168
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,590
Look at them. I can't put up with them anymore.

169
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,350
Calm down.

170
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,999
Even if you haven't experience it yourself, you must've witnessed enough.

171
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,429
Who's the inexperienced one?

172
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,220
I'm stacked with experience.

173
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm referring to true love,

174
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,460
not the kind of flings

175
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,690
that ends before it even develops.

176
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,209
Duration doesn't determine love.

177
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,949
Short-lived romance is still love.

178
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,450
Why are you brushing off my love?

179
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,130
So cheeky.

180
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,640
Love...

181
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,010
is a mutual attraction between two souls.

182
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,169
Love at first sight is just physical attraction from looks.

183
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,760
People like you who hunt for partners at a bar

184
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,980
don't even care about physical appearances anymore.

185
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,969
When the light goes down and alcohol muddles the brain, you tangle all night long.

186
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:06,980
The next day, only ashes are left from the fires of carnal ...

187
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,480
desire.

188
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm warning you. These are biases against me.

189
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,910
I'm not biased.

190
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,060
This is just a summary of your life.

191
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,749
Bullshit. You've reduced my love to ashes.

192
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,619
It's so late. Why isn't Sister Manjun back yet?

193
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:25,989
She rented a car and drove to Kunming to hang out with her friends.

194
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:27,980
She won't be around for a few days.

195
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,410
She went to Kunming?

196
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,570
Didn't she tell you?

197
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,220
No, she didn't.

198
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,099
We're just neighbors. She doesn't need to tell me.

199
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,900
She didn't tell me.

200
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,069
Smells amazing. They're ready to be eaten.

201
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,719
The insides aren't cooked yet. Roast them a little longer.

202
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,800
Roast them a little longer.

203
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,270
Have some peanuts.

204
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,510
Damai, come and sit with us.

205
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,550
Sure.

206
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,690
What smells so good?

207
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,530
We're roasting chestnuts.

208
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,699
Is Na Na asleep?

209
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,270
Yes.

210
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,390
We had no idea what happened to Na Na.

211
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,529
If Damai hadn't called us to take note of her emotions,

212
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,169
we might've still been clueless even after she left.

213
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,460
Na Na came here because of this.

214
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,309
She'd never tell us.

215
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,129
She should've told us anyway.

216
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,070
Perhaps we could help her.

217
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,080
How?

218
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,870
At the very least, we can show some concern.

219
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,269
I searched online about this incident.

220
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,149
Her personal details such as her address

221
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,429
and phone number were spilled online.

222
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,970
It's horrifying.

223
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,790
This bunch of people

224
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,540
should be arrested and locked up in jail.

225
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,300
Damai, when did you learn about this?

226
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,789
The day you celebrated my birthday for me.

227
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,489
At the bar of Mr. Hu's friend.

228
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,620
<i>Are you Singing Nana-chan?</i>

229
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,289
<i>No, I'm not. You've got the wrong person.</i>

230
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:03,919
<i>Sorry.</i>

231
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,540
<i>It's fine.</i>

232
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,390
I searched "Singing Nana-chan" online once I was back.

233
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,760
That's when I found out.

234
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,540
<i>What's with that look?</i>

235
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,919
<i>Isn't she Singing Nana-chan? Right?</i>

236
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,959
<i>The one accused of donation fraud?</i>

237
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,970
<i>- Yes.
- That's right. She's the one.</i>

238
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,929
<i>That's right. She's the streamer who stole donations!</i>

239
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,569
<i>You're the streamer who stole donations?</i>

240
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:58,909
<i>That's her!</i>

241
00:16:58,909 --> 00:16:59,929
<i>Why hasn't she been banned?</i>

242
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,861
<i>Explain yourself!</i>
- <i>You look exactly like a crook.</i>

243
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,450
<i>- Why did you commit fraud?
- No.</i>

244
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,460
<i>No, I didn't!</i>

245
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
<i> Found her! That's her!</i>

246
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,440
<i>- How could you do that?</i>
<i>- You're a crook.</i>

247
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
<i>How could you lie?</i>

248
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,660
<i>She's the one!</i>

249
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,700
<i>Hurry up! She's the crook!</i>

250
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,120
Cuo Bazi.

251
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,840
Cuo Bazi!

252
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,010
Come over here.

253
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,240
It's fine.

254
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,590
Just let it sleep here.

255
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,950
Did it wake you up?

256
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,990
No.

257
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,660
I had a dream just now.

258
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,150
Want some water?

259
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,740
Here you go.

260
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,630
Thank you.

261
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,740
Feeling better?

262
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,380
Why are you still up?

263
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm writing new chapters for the update.

264
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,490
What was the dream about?

265
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,130
I...

266
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,690
had a nightmare.

267
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,720
I was surrounded by a big crowd.

268
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,749
You already said it's a dream. It's not true.

269
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:49,320
Empty your mind.

270
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,849
Just sleep. I'll let Cuo Bazi accompany you

271
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,690
and watch over you.

272
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,859
You'll be fine. I'm here, too.

273
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,539
Go back to sleep.

274
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,040
Stay here and watch over her.

275
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,860
We're here so soon.

276
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,980
I'll pick you up after work.

277
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,110
Give me a kiss.

278
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,070
That's enough.

279
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
Get going.

280
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,399
I'm off.

281
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,030
<i>[Wind[</i>
Bye-bye.

282
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,160
It's a nice day today.

283
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,189
Thank god you're here.

284
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,499
How's the construction going?

285
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,640
I just came from the construction site.

286
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,599
Well done, President Xu.

287
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,380
It's nothing. Friendship means the most to women.

288
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,620
Isn't that so?

289
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,020
By the way, how's Na Na?

290
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,300
She's okay. Damai came back and is with her.

291
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
Is Damai back?

292
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,160
That's good. I didn't sleep well last night.

293
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,970
Why?

294
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,020
- Look.
- What is this?

295
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,940
Text messages.

296
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,923
<i>[Are you the manager? How can you hire someone like that?</i>

297
00:21:58,923 --> 00:22:01,990
<i>[I'm Na Na's fan. She's a kind girl. Hope she can live a good life.]</i>

298
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,730
<i>[Fire her if you don't want to go down with her!]</i>

299
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,243
<i>[Why hasn't that Na Na been fired? I'm sick of seeing her again.]</i>

300
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:17,630
They're way too harsh.

301
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,160
There are quite a lot of encouraging messages, too.

302
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,380
Really? I didn't dare read the rest.

303
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,163
<i>[I know this cafe because of Na Na. I love her voice and your cafe. I wish I could go there every day.]</i>

304
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,910
Excuse me, is Na Na coming today?

305
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,290
Who are you? Why are you looking for her?

306
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,430
I'm the reporter of a program called "Imperfect Human."

307
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,930
I want to interview Nana-chan.

308
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,799
We're a talk show. Have you watched our show before?

309
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,190
Nope.

310
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,740
Well, let me give you a brief introduction to our program.

311
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,990
Reporter Xu, we're pretty busy.

312
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,730
How about this? Could you pass me Na Na's phone number?

313
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,670
I'll contact her directly.

314
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,109
I'm afraid I can't.

315
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,800
How about this? I'll tell Na Na about this.

316
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,009
Let her decide whether she wants to do the interview.

317
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,839
I'll get her to contact you if she's willing.

318
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,640
Okay, that's fine. Please pass on the message.

319
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,729
Sure. Where are you seated?

320
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,320
Over there.

321
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,630
Please wait a moment. Your order will be ready soon.

322
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,639
Okay, thank you.

323
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,490
You're welcome.

324
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,500
He's a fly that never stops chasing cake. He only knows how to gorge on others' misery. Don't give a damn about him.

325
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,470
He's still a customer.

326
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,019
Since he likes to gorge on things, we have an abundance of food here for him.

327
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,940
Let's stuff him full.

328
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,359
<i>Dear friends, hello!</i>

329
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,139
<i>This time, we're at the famous Artisan Wood Carving Workshop, a wood carving art museum.</i>

330
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:40,589
<i>Behind me, we have Xia Xia, a famous wood carving craftsman.</i>

331
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,979
<i>This time, we won't just take you to admire wood carving skills...</i>

332
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:44,969
I'll end today's live stream.

333
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,930
I'm going to have lunch. Bye-bye.

334
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,390

336

<i>All right, let's explore farther left.</i>

337
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,980
<i>Come on, I'll show you the room over there.</i>

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm off, Yingzi.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

340
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,770
This way.

341
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,460
<i>Do you want a coffee?</i>

342
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,980
<i>Would you like ice?</i>

343
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,930
<i>More ice, please.</i>

344
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,970
Phony, come back!

345
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,209
Xia Xia, why are you here?

346
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,990
I saw that you didn't go to work.

347
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,020
I took a few days off.

348
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,610
This is Damai's dog, Cuo Bazi.

349
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,100
What does "Cuo Bazi" mean?

350
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,549
It's Changsha's dialect. It means liar.

351
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,900
I'll make some coffee.

352
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,180
You know what I used to work as, don't you?

353
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,420
I'm sure you didn't expect me to be so famous.

354
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,110
Not bad, you even came over to check on me.

355
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,760
I didn't waste my effort being nice to you.

356
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,989
But I'm fine now. Don't worry.

357
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,250
How could you be fine?

358
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,420
Even I think it's scary as a bystander.

359
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,180
It's a little scary,

360
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,980
but I'm really fine.

361
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,210
Are you leaving soon?

362
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,810
I planned to stay with my parents in Shanghai.

363
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,420
I even bought the ticket, but Damai came back.

364
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,450
So, if you had left two days ago, you wouldn't have come back, would you?

365
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,660
Perhaps.

366
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:20,030
I don't know, but I'll still continue my investment in the homestay.

367
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,840
Where do you want to go?

368
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,860
No idea.

369
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,999
Just like how I never thought that I'd stay in Yunnan for too long.

370
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,910
Do you still remember the day I first came to Yunnan?

371
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,360
Yes.

372
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,460
At that time, I was at my lowest.

373
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,130
I was completely lost.

374
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,130
So, I dashed out of my home for a road trip.

375
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,760
My plan was to drive ceaselessly ahead

376
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,650
and see where the road would take me.

377
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,789
<i>- Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you for a favor?</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

378
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,109
<i>When I was reversing my car just now, the wheel got stuck in the pit.</i>

379
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:47,800
<i>Can you help me push it out?</i>

380
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,760
<i>No problem.</i>

381
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,320
<i>Thank you.</i>

382
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,280
<i>Over here.</i>

383
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,050
<i>Wait a second.</i>

384
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,190
<i>- Get in the car. Close the roof.
- Okay.</i>

385
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,350
<i>Okay, let's do this!</i>

386
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,080
<i>One, two, three. Press the accelerator.</i>

387
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,110
<i>Stop! Wait.</i>

388
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,070
<i>Try again.</i>

389
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,450
<i>One, two, three. Press the accelerator.</i>

390
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,890
<i>Thank you so much. You just saved my day.</i>

391
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,700
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

392
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,189
<i>Sorry for getting you so muddy.</i>

393
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,949
<i>I'm fine. Don't worry. I'll change my clothes when I get back.</i>

394
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:09,130
<i>Wipe off some of the dirt first.</i>

395
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,230
<i>Here you go. Take this.</i>

396
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,790
<i>Thank you.</i>

397
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,450
<i>- Thanks.
- I'm really sorry.</i>

398
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,460
<i>Don't worry.</i>

399
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,750
<i>Well, I... I need to get going. Bye-bye.</i>

400
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,750
<i>Mister, are there any restaurants nearby?</i>

401
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,700
<i>There's one in the village ahead.</i>

402
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,199
<i>Can you show me the way? I'd like to buy you a meal.</i>

403
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:38,110
<i>I can show you the way, but you don't have to buy me food.</i>

404
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,110
<i>Xia Xia!</i>

405
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,460
<i>- Sister.
- What happened?</i>

406
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,849
<i>Her car got stuck in the pit. I helped her get it out.</i>

407
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,590
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

408
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,409
<i>Sister, she wants to have lunch. Take her to Galsang Flower Restaurant.</i>

409
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:51,989
<i>Okay. You can ride this bicycle home. Pass me the helment.</i>

410
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,500
<i>Sure.</i>

411
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,319
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

412
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,270
<i>See you, Mister. Thank you.</i>

413
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,160
<i> Don't sweat it.</i>

414
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,390
<i>Are you here to road trip around Dali?</i>

415
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,530
<i>Yes.</i>

416
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,859
<i>How did you get here? Was there an issue with your GPS?</i>

417
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:08,009
<i>I didn't use the GPS.</i>

418
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,289
<i>I was just driving wherever the road led.</i>

419
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,650
<i>I'll let fate guide me.</i>

420
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,110
<i>What do you think? Isn't this place gorgeous?</i>

421
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,650
<i>Yes, it's relaxing. There aren't many people either.</i>

422
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,890
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

423
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,690
<i>Follow me.</i>

424
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,830
Life is really magical.

425
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,650
If my wheel didn't get stuck in the pit,

426
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,000
I wouldn't have met you and Xiaochun.

427
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,960
I wouldn't have stayed here.

428
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,420
I wouldn't have

429
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,760
made so many good friends.

430
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,030
In that case, don't leave.

431
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,490
At least, don't leave like this.

432
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,780
Don't leave like this?

433
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,950
My mom said that... one should never leave with an empty stomach,

434
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,220
with grievances in one's heart,

435
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,840
or with tears.

436
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,360
People who leave like this always suffer.

437
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,900
Those who fail to make them stay suffer as well.

438
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,009
If you want to leave, wait until you're feeling happy to do so.

439

441
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,560

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,590
Got it.

443
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,460
If I'm leaving,

444
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,600
I'm going to leave happily.

445
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,730
Yeah. It's a deal. I'm off.

446
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,119
Have a cup of coffee before you go.

447
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,590
No, thanks.

448
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,760
Xie Xiaoxia!

449
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,740
You helped me. I said I'd buy you lunch but you rejected me.

450
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,320
You spent your time to console me.

451
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,150
I want to treat you to coffee, but you still reject me.

452
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,660
Why are you so selfless?

453
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,900
It's fine as long as you cheer up.

454
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,079
That's all you need?

455
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,250
Yes, that's all.

461
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,739
The clouds. The clouds are so beautiful today.

462
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,310
It was the same yesterday.

463
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,680
Was it?

464
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,870
Is the coffee ready?

465
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,289
I left the water boiling.

466
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,490
We have to wait for the temperature to drop first.

467
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,190
Xia Xia dropped by earlier.

468
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,140
- Xia Xia?
- Yeah.

469
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,070
<i>Go!</i>

470
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,859
<i>- Over there!</i>
- Uncle, running a business is definitely a good thing.

471
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:38,289
However, the sudden stream of tourists was a chance occurrence.

472
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:41,249
We won't always have so many visitors.

473
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,089
You mentioned taking out a loan for a commercial vehicle to ferry passengers.

474
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,450
This is really too risky.

475
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,599
Why can't I do it if others can?

476
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,660
Is your home located at that intersection?

477
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,879
You can simply put fruits and tie-dyed tablecloths at the door.

478
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,799
It won't take up much of your time.

479
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,969
You can even attach a QR code to your door

480
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,599
so that people can pay with their mobile phone

481
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,030
as long as you state the prices.

482
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,289
- Okay, I see.
- No problem.

483
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:13,619
- I'll ask the homestays if they're hiring.
- Okay.

484
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,980
What are you good at?

485
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,060
Cooking?

486
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,140
Cleaning?

487
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,659
I can do all of those.

488
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,180
Okay, got it.

489
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,929
Don't just focus on Brother A'Yao's profits recently.

490
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,920
You need to be aware of the efforts and money he has invested over the years.

491
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,970
He hasn't even earned back the money he invested.

492
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,300
If you really want to start a business, rent a small store in town

493
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,719
while rental is relatively low.

494
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,260
It's hard to start a big business.

495
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,710
I'll leave you to your work. I'm off.

496
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,049
Okay. Take care.

497
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,950
Brother.

498
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,170
A'Yao.

499
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,750
Xiao Huang.

500
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,100
Why are you here?

501
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,829
I need to speak with the secretary. What are you doing?

502
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:57,780
I just met with at least a dozen people.

503
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,989
All of them want to start businesses. I listened to their plans one by one.

504
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:03,439
Being street sellers who ply their own trade is pretty decent.

505
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:05,529
Some of them are overambitious.

506
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,750
They insist on venturing into the tourism industry chain

507
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,700
when they have no idea what that is.

508
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,489
We can't help them with that. Some people haven't got what it takes to handle risks.

509
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,060
They have no risk awareness as well.

510
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,230
I talked until my lips bled.

511
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,909
There are more people coming this afternoon.

512
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,830
Thankfully, the village director will come over.

513
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,780
I'll have someone backing me up.

514
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,910
<i>Xiao Huang. Xiao Huang!</i>

515
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,239
Uncle Deqing?

516
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,750
Uncle! What happened to your eye?

517
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,309
A'Yao, you're here. I walked into the door.

518
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:37,090
That looks very serious.

519
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,800
Let's not talk about it anymore.

520
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,720
Xiao Huang, don't worry about the old estate.

521
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,430
What did Grandpa Yang say?

522
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,709
We almost succeeded in persuading him,

523
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,679
but a bunch of people visited the house last week.

524
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,980
Then, he went back on his word.

525
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,889
Elderly folks are too old to think straight.

526
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,229
Don't fret over this matter. It's a done deal.

527
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:56,600
We'll certainly support the village's development.

528
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,200
I'll get going since there's nothing else.

529
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,779
- Take care.
- See you.

530
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,049
Do you know who did this to his eye?

531
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:10,059
Who?

532
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,050
I met Aunty A'Gui in the morning.

533
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,570
She told me that Grandpa Yang

534
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,150
hit him with a water pipe.

535
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:28,340
Sister Hongdou, did Sister Na Na really earn a fortune from live streaming?

536
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,130
I don't know.

537
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,289
Online posts state that just one of her dresses costs over ¥20,000.

538
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:35,710
Who spends ¥20,000 on a dress?

539
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,850
She must be filthy rich.

540
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,279
Put away the paper towels.

541
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:41,639
I'm sure it'll rain tonight.

542
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,260
Okay.

543
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,149
I also saw online posts stating that she dated many boys in school.

544
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,879
I don't believe them. It's all nonsense.

545
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,750
You shouldn't talk about such nonsense, either.

546
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,890
I know. I'll never gossip about this.

547
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,679
But Sister Na Na shouldn't take this to heart.

548
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,239
She doesn't have to bother with such things.

549
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,709
Screw what other people say. A clean hand wants no washing.

550
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,119
She just needs a strong mind.

551
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,969
Call the police and sue them without hesitation.

552
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,409
You're not the one going through this,

553
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,810
so you can be nonchalant.

554
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,750
Not everyone has the same mental grit.

555
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,079
Don't use your imagination

556
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,470
to evaluate the lives of others thoughtlessly.

557
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,719
Sister Hongdou, don't scold me.

558
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,199
I didn't say much.

559
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm not scolding you.

560
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,749
Aren't you going to have a barbecue with friends? You can get going.

561
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:38,690
May I?

562
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,360
It's fine. Leave it there. I'll clean it up.

563
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,630
Go and meet your friends. I'll clean this up. Thank you, Sister Hongdou.

564
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Why are you crouching there?

565
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,649
The glass is broken. I need to pick up the pieces.

566
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:01,770
Get up.

567
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,710
Don't cut your hand.

568
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,970
Get up. I don't want to get up. I'm tired.

569
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,020
Come on.

570
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,780
Tired?

571
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,830
Why does our dear Dou seem like she's upset?

572
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,460
Don't imitate how my parents talk.

573
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,199
I saw the video you sent me.

574
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,520
Your dad was like, "Dou."

575
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,579
"Dou." "What are you doing, Dou?"

576
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,710
So annoying.

577
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,490
I'll stop.

578
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,460
Why are you upset?

579
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,680
Too tired?

580
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,929
Today, I somehow received several phone calls looking for Na Na.

581
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,020
I was dragged into the distress.

582
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,529
Well, take a day off tomorrow. Don't work at the cafe.

583
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:21,700
Xiaochun and Xiao Xin can manage.

584
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,610
I'm covering Na Na's shift.

585
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,130
It's fine. I'll come over tomorrow at noon.

586
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,490
I'll leave if they aren't busy.

587
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,050
Come here.

588
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,910
All done.

589
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,710
Don't deceive yourself.

590
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,629
Why can't I deceive myself? As long as it works.

591
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,810
I'll take you somewhere.

592
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,130
I haven't finished cleaning up yet.

593
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,970
All right.

594
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,530
You sit here and supervise me. I'll clean up.

595
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,090
Still thinking about Na Na?

596
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,810
I'm thinking about how to help her.

597
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,490
You're already helping her.

598
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,950
You console her, cover her shifts, and cook for her.

599
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,010
Though, the food isn't great.

600
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,950
It isn't great?

601
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,950
Not great?

602
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,350
I even added sugar to the fried eggs with tomatoes for her.

603
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,640
Can't you tell that I'm joking?

604
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,110
Sometimes, language doesn't work.

605
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,350
Words like "Keep going,"

606
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,040
"We support you" and "We got your back"

607
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,120
can be easily said,

608
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,060
but they sound so powerless.

609
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,130
Don't you think so?

610
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,570
Here's what I think.

611
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,400
We share the same wish for Na Na to get better.

612
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,270
However, we cannot be trapped and influenced by this issue.

613
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,019
This is the problem that Na Na needs to solve on her own.

614
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:40,699
The solution to the problem can only be figured out on her own.

615
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,980
Can't we help her figure it out?

616
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,480
Actually, I've thought about this.

617
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,580
I'm afraid that you'll hit me if I tell you.

618
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,210
What is it?

619
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,060
Promise that you won't hit me or get angry.

620
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,860
Just say it.

621
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,960
We can try something more practical.

622
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,849
We might as well encourage Na Na to start live streaming again.

623
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,069
She can face her inner demons upfront.

624
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,359
She can get up from where she fell down.

625
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,549
Besides, it'll be great promotion for your homestay.

626
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,689
You can sell your products and make money through live streaming.

627
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:23,550
Just leverage her popularity for good.

628
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,600
Are you out of your mind?

629
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,380
After that, you can talk about your best friend.

630
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,639
Share your experiences when you were distressed and heartbroken.

631
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,900
Encourage her to be positive about life.

632
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,910
What? What's with this expression?

633
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,960
You make me feel like I'm a bottle of poison.

634
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,679
She's already in this state, but you want her to restart live streaming?

635
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:48,660
Don't you have any humanity left in you?

636
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,439
My suggestion might sound brutal,

637
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:54,060
but she needs to break free from this prison.

638
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,779
Break free from this prison?

639
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:57,780
Step out of her comfort zone!

640
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,180
Is that what you mean?

641
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,820
Listen up. This idea is absurd!

642
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,399
Step out of her comfort zone?

643
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,999
She finally gained some relief.

644
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,060
Why are you making her dive into agony and hardship?

645
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
Are you insane?

646
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,330
Our conversation ends here.

647
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,319
It's so dark right now. Be careful.

648
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,460
What are you laughing at?

649
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,489
I'll help you up. I got you.

650
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:25,920
We're severing all ties for three days!

651
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,740
Don't touch me!

652
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,980
I'm sorry. My bad. Won't an apology do?

653
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,280
- Hongdou!
- Leave me alone.

654
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,660
Hongdou!

655
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,190
Dou!

656
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,760
Dou!

657
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,729
Hold on. My horse is still here. Give me a second.

658
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,679
Wait for me!

659
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:49,140
