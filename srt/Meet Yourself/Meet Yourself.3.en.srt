00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,660
In the evening,

4
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,669
especially around the hour of hai (9 p.m. to 11 p.m.),

5
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,189
drinking a moderate amount of black tea

6
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,369
- can promote gastrointestinal motility.
- Na Na!

7
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,930
Mr. Ma.

8
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,389
I brought supper over for you.

9
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,890
Thanks.

10
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,329
Where's the new tenant? Invite her down for food.

11
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,600
She's not back yet.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,339
It's already so late in the night.

13
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,389
Where could she possibly be?

14
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,600
Maybe she's taking a stroll at the beach.

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,499
The light in Damai's room is still on.

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,580
Call her down to eat.

17
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,249
Don't bother her. She's writing.

18
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,969
She can decide whether to join us or not,

19
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,269
but we're in the wrong if we don't invite her.

20
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,799
She doesn't like to be in a crowd.

21
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,349
Stop pressuring others.

22
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,579
Why am I in the wrong for being hospitable?

23
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:16,269
She shouldn't stay cooped up in her room forever.

24
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,339
She'll fall sick if she doesn't come out for fresh air.

25
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,059
- Damai, come down for supper!
- Stop yelling!

26
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm sorry!

27
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,150
What did Damai say?

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,190
How do you know it's Damai?

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,610
Here, Mr. Ma.

30
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,180
No food after noontime.

31
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,600
It's really her.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,689
"I'm good." "Thank you."

33
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,740
Good guess, Na Na.

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,619
All right. Have a drink.

35
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:47,509
I won't drink.

36
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,609
I have to help out at the warehouse with Sister Xiaochun early tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,590
What's with both of you? No food after noontime and no drinks after noontime.

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,270
You guys are really...

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,230
I'll invite a friend over.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,260
All of you are here!

41
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,229
Speak of the devil!

42
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,750
Come on, Chairman Xie. Have a drink.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,109
You should've told me earlier.

44
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,740
We came back from dinner at my house.

45
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,899
Who's this?

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,690
I'm Xu Hongdou, the new tenant.

47
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,739
I live upstairs.

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,250
Nice to meet you. I'll introduce myself.

49
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,559
I'm Hu Youyu. Just call me Old Hu.

50
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,580
- Nice to meet you, Old Hu.
- Nice to meet you, too.

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,800
This is Ma Qiushan. We call him Mr. Ma.

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,620
I saw him meditating over there this afternoon.

53
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,190
- This is...
- Na Na.

54
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,140
Hello, Na Na.

55
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,550
So, a beautiful lady had dinner at your house?

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,000
Aunty Baoping brought some beef over.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,509
Why didn't you invite me over for beef?

58
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,970
If you guys came over, there won't be enough.

59
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,130
Well...You guys can drink. I'm busy tonight.

60
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,439
- Rest early.
- Okay.

61
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,709
How can you be busy at night? Have a drink!

62
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,269
I'll take a rain check. I'm off!

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,689
Well, Hongdou, let's celebrate your arrival.

64
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,419
I haven't unpacked yet.

65
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,349
I need to tidy up first. We can do this tomorrow.

66
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,419
Get an early rest.

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,049
Look for me if you need anything. I'm in this room.

68
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,110
Okay.

69
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,740
Hongdou, shall we add each other on WeChat?

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,029
See, my phone is broken.

71
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,740
Let's wait until it's fixed.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,479
- Good night.
- Good night.

73
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:20,939
I... I live in that room.

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,780
If you have any difficulties, you can look for me, too.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,350
<i>Okay.</i>

76
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,460
All right.

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,300
She's also introverted.

78
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,840
Even more introverted than Damai.

79
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,349
I'll head back first.

80
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,399
Thanks for your supper.

81
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,220
Hey, stay a little longer.

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,710
Wait... At least leave me some barbecue.

83
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,960
Old Hu.

84
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,250
Let it be.

85
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,260
People should learn

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,420
to be comfortable with themselves.

87
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,590
Let's meditate.

88
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,230
I'll drink on my own.

<i>tomato omelette, and fried pig snouts with chili?</i>

<i>Don't you find these dishes interesting?</i>

102
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,510
<i>I just think this restaurant serves food too slowly.</i>

103
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,899
<i>Here's the thing. I have to head back to the hotel right after dinner.</i>

<i>- Waiter!
- Yeah!</i>

<i>A bowl of rice, please! Hurry up!</i>

112
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,810
<i>Okay. Please wait a moment.</i>

<i>Actually, I just want to try their water poplar flower soup.</i>

<i>Water poplar flower soup?</i>

118
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,490
<i>How did it get this name?</i>

119
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,819
<i>That vegetable is called water poplar flower.</i>

120

<i>I don't know. I've never tasted it either. </i>

Hi.

My name is Xu Hongdou. What's yours?

136
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,539
I didn't sleep well yesterday.

137
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,370
The window was open and mosquitoes were coming in.

138

Let me pet you.

139

Hi, nice to meet you.

140
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,589
I'm Xu Hongdou. I arrived yesterday.

141
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,620
Hello, my name is Damai.

142
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,069
Damai.

143
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,019
Hongdou and Damai.

144
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,790
We're both food.
<i>(T/N: Hongdou refers to red bean and Damai refers to barley)</i>

You're up so early.

146
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,790
I haven't slept yet.

147
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,310
Did you stay up all night?

148
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,539
Well, I'm almost done with cooking.

149
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,559
It's fine. I won't be eating.

150
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,989
I'm just saying hello.

151

Please go on.

152
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,199
I've cooked too much. Would you like to have some?

153
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,739
No, thanks.

154
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,829
I... I'll make myself a bowl of cereal later.

155
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,850
Thank you.

156
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,660
It's no big deal. I've really made too much.

157
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,359
All right then. Thank you.

- Are there mosquitoes in your room?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,689
I forgot to close the windows before heading to bed last night.

162

There are a lot of mosquitoes here.

I have insecticide and essential balm in my room.

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,160
I'll pass them to you later.

165
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,040
Sure. Thank you.

166
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,860
You sound like you have a Hunan accent.

167
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,499
I used to work in a hotel.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,739
A well-acquainted VIP customer of mine

169
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,120
was also from Hunan Province.

170
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,110
Your accents are similar.

171
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,540
Where is the hotel?

172
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,259
A five-star hotel in Beijing.

173
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,910
So, you're from Beijing?

174
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,820
Nope.

175
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,229
I studied in Beijing.

176
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,690
Then, I found a job in Beijing.

177
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,090
I spent more than ten years in Beijing.

178
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,990
I am from Shandong Province.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,200
Well, why are you here?

180
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,900
I quit my job. I came here to relax and unwind.

181
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
How are you going to do that?

182
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Have you just changed a spot to scroll through your phone?

183
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,100
That's not it. The scenery here is gorgeous.

184
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,800
It's worthwhile to try putting away my phone.

185
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,259
So, what are your plans for today?

186
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,400
Fixing my phone. My phone is broken.

187
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,300
Isn't it the perfect chance to go offline?

188
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,000
As long as your phone is within reach, you'll always want to use it.

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Now that it isn't working, you won't want to use it.

190
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,600
Well...

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
Since I cooked breakfast, can you wash the dishes?

192
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Of course. You can rest.

193
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,600
Thank you.

194
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Then, I'm off.

195
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,420
<i>[Got you a book to pass the time.]</i>

196
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,899
Breakfast!

197
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,100
Hurry up! I'm about to be late for work.

198
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,160
Got it. All right.

199
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,609
Granny can't wait.

200
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,230
She's angry.

201
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,190
Let's have breakfast.

202
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,659
Our young master hasn't come down yet.

203
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,789
What's up with him? Does he want to be served breakfast in bed?

204
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,949
Xiao Hu Lu, get your uncle down for breakfast.

205
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:51,650
Go on.

206
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,189
Don't be angry with him.

207
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,189
His heart is long gone.

208
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,580
He won't listen to us anymore.

209
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,340
Yeah, he won't.

210
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,070
No matter what I tell him,

211
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,609
it goes in one ear and out the other. Nothing enters his brain.

212
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:07,930
If I were angry with him, he would've pissed me off into my grave by now.

213
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,509
Don't let anger kill you. A single casualty like me is enough.

214
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,080
Your dad is waiting for me in the afterlife anyway.

215
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,320
Li Baoping!

216
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,359
You are the last person who should be killed by anger.

217
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,619
You've suffered terribly in life.

218
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,189
Now, it's finally time for you to enjoy retirement.

219
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,360
If you die of anger, even the King of Hell won't approve.

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,640
The ghosts won't dare to claim your soul.

221
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,859
Let Dad wait a few more years.

222
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,930
He can wait several decades.

223
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,859
Granny, Uncle won't get up.

224
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,920
Uncle A'Yuan is also sleeping in his room.

225
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,830
Okay, you can eat breakfast.

226
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,139
When did A'Yuan come over?

227
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,890
I don't know.

228
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,190
I'll go upstairs and have a look.

229
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,470
Are you the new tenant?

230
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,549
Yes. Hello.

231
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,539
Hello and welcome.

232
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,899
Mr. Ma.

233
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,949
You don't have to greet him.

234
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,800
He can't hear you during the day.

235
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,910
Newbie.

236
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,250
I need to make some things clear to you.

237
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,139
I'm responsible for cleaning this yard.

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,659
Don't throw your garbage haphazardly or leave it at your door.

239
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,269
Leave it in the garbage bin next to the laundry room.

240
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,209
Can you see it? Your garbage goes there.

241
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,259
One more thing, you have to clean your room yourself.

242
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,389
I won't be responsible for that.

243
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,270
- Okay.
- Got it?

244
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,449
Yes. I got it.

245
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,180
You're very pretty.

246
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,710
Just like my girl, Xiao Xi.

247
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,960
Why did you come here?

248
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,909
I'm here to take a break.

249
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,470
The air here is fresh.

250
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,909
What about your job?

251
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,570
I quit.

252
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,859
Only city folks like you are bold enough to quit your job as you please.

253
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,770
I'm not an employee.

254
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,059
One-third of the rooms in this courtyard belong to me.

255
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,650
I'm a landlady.

256
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,149
Oh, Mrs. Landlady!

257
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,500
No wonder you have such a dignified tone.

258
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,290
Mrs. Landlady?

259
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,430
I've never been called this,

260
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,149
but it sounds really fancy.

261
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,909
City ladies sure are sweet-talkers.

262
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,030
Dignified?

263
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,149
I'm just a village granny.

264
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,299
Don't keep your distance.

265
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,669
You can call me Aunty A'Gui from now on.

266
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,850
Okay, Aunty A'Gui.

267
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,399
Where is your hometown?

268
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,850
I'm from Shandong Province.

269
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,780
Shandong Province?

270
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,299
Qingdao?

271
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,429
Nope, it's just a small Tier 3 city.

272
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,430
But it's not far away from Qingdao.

273
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,490
That's still quite a coincidence.

274
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,530
My son and daughter are both in Qingdao.

275
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,450
They didn't go there to work.

276
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,189
They got into universities in Qingdao

277
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,769
and they stayed there after graduation.

278
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,330
Now, they're married with children.

279
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,739
That's impressive.

280
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,190
Nonsense.

281
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,040
My son, Dayang,

282
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,230
bought a huge apartment in Qingdao.

283
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,629
What's the point of buying such a huge place?

284
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,749
He still has to pay the mortgage. Don't you agree?

285
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,239
Aunty A'Gui, do you know how to get to Xiaochun's cafe?

286
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,429
Of course.

287
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,760
It's really close by.

288
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,579
Head out and turn left.

289
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,509
Walk to the end, and you'll see another alley. Then turn left.

290
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,089
After that, walk to the end of the road and turn right.

291
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,059
Keep walking and you'll arrive at the entrance of the town.

292
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,419
- Ask someone else when you're there.
- Okay.

293
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:55,150
But it's very close.

294
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,890
Thank you.

295
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,840
He's deaf during the day.

296
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,020
- You should go on.
- Sure.

297
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,870
I'm off.

Yes. These are all my handicrafts.

328
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,769
Which one do you like? I'll give it to you.

329
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,570
- You don't have to do that. Thank you.
- Take it

330
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,529
It's okay.

331
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,570
Where are you going?

332
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,189
I want to go to Xiaochun's cafe.

333
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,380
How do I get there?

334
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,200
You're going in the opposite direction!

335
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,710
Head east at the intersection up ahead.

336
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,819
I'll take you there.

337
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,999
It's fine. I can manage.

338
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,819
Don't worry. I'm heading that direction, too.

339
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,579
Granny, I'm off to the cafe.

340
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,050
Okay.

341
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,049
See you, Granny.

342
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,740
Hongdou!

343
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,629
Here's an orange for you.

344
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,840
Thank you, Granny.

345
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,369
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

346
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,580
I'll pick you up in the evening.

347
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,299
This way.

348
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,100
You went in the opposite direction.

349
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,570
I feel like we've come full circle.

350
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,100
Aren't you here to travel? I'll show you around.

351
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,300
Aren't you going to fix your phone today?

352
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,680
I can fix it tomorrow.

353
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,230
Are you avoiding creditors?

354
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,030
You sure know how to start a conversation.

355
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,090
That's what everyone says.

356
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,800
After all, it's probably evident to you.

357
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm the most handsome guy in our village.

358
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,680
They call me Pony Prince.

359
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,729
However, I've never relied on my looks for money.

360
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,440
I take online classes every day.

361
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,720
After all, my mind was wiped clean about linear equations with one unknown variable

362
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,620
after graduating from junior high school.

363
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,690
A friendly reminder for you.

364
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,149
You could've laughed at me when I said I was the most handsome.

365
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,739
I don't find things awkward.

366
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,360
It's fine if you don't talk.

367
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,829
Well, walk slower. It's like your legs are powered by engines.

368
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,130
I'm already walking slowly!

369
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,610
The scenery is so gorgeous.

370
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,540
Take a look at Erhai Lake.

371
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,050
Isn't Erhai Lake beautiful?

372
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,020
♫ <i> Do you ever feel alone?</i> ♫

373
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,850
When I was a child,

374
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,560
my grandpa had a fishing boat. It was really small.

375
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,769
Every time I stood on it, the boat wobbled and scared me out of my wits.

376
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Yet, when my grandpa stood on it and started fishing, it was particularly stable.

377
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,609
Every time my grandpa went fishing on the lake with the osprey,

378
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,330
I'd sit by Erhai Lake and wait for him.

379
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,620
Have you ever seen an osprey?

380
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,300
It's a type of blackbird with a really wide beak. It's particularly good at catching fish.

381
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,760
Though, they're rarely seen now.

382
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,000
Was your grandfather a fisherman?

383
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,260
We're just living off the land.

384
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,890
In the past, Erhai Lake was clear and abundant with fish.

385
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,699
After that, the government wanted to protect Erhai Lake's ecology,

386
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,099
so they banned fishing.

387
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,570
Fishing boats can no longer be seen.

388
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,410
But every time I come to Erhai Lake,

389
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,419
I always feel that my grandpa is still fishing out there.

390
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,910
Time really flies.

391
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,870
Yeah.

392
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,820
As a child, I thought time crawled by slowly.

393
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,670
But now, time goes by too quickly.

394
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,620
♫ <i>The sun will rise and fall</i> ♫

395
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,060
Your granny is pretty affable.

396
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,030
- She likes you.
- Really?

397
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,890
Let me ask you a question.

398
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,670
What's a linear equation with one unknown variable?

399
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,050
If an equation is of the first degree with only one variable,

400
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,290
and it always has a straight line as a graph,

401
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,570
that's a linear equation with one unknown variable.

402
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,260
Did you really forget it?

403
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,920
You're weird for remembering it so clearly.

404
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,370
Na Na.

405
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,990
Chairman Xie.

406
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,739
- Xu Hongdou.
- Na Na.

407
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,390
Xiao Hu Lu. Guobao.

408
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,250
- Uncle!
- Uncle A'Yao!

409
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,640
Are you done with cleaning your room?

410
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,260
- We want to ride a plane!
- You want to ride a plane?

411
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,480
- Let's go. We can fly!
- What do you want to drink?

412
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,779
Xiaochun already gave me instructions.

413
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,389
Your first drink is on the house.

414
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,210
Don't do that. Business is business.

415
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,709
We're looking to retain customers.

416
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,059
Gifts win hearts.

417
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,629
You have to come over often and support our business.

418
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,639
Sure.

419
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,869
I haven't had lunch yet.

420
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,720
Take a look at the menu.

421
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,989
Where's Xiaochun?

422
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,100
She went to pick up someone at the junction.

423
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,989
I recommend the porcini pancake.

424
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,290
- Okay.
<i>- Na Na!</i>

425
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,459
Na Na! Is the coffee ready?

426
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:58,550
- Yes.
- Chairman Xie.

427
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,400
Isn't this Hongdou?

428
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,740
You look gorgeous today.

429
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,310
I can tell you're a tourist immediately.

430
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,129
Well, I'm heading downtown to sing.

431
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,089
How about joining me?

432
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,140
I have plans for today.

433
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,989
By the way, I haven't added you on WeChat yet.

434
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,930
Can I have your WeChat? Let me scan your QR code.

435
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,210
Here.

436
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,579
My phone is broken.

437
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,230
Oh, it really is.

438
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,270
Well... How about this?

439
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,369
Come downtown with me,

440
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,769
and you can fix your phone.

441
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:31,170
Then, I can add you on WeChat.

442
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,770
I want to rest today.

443
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,270
You want to rest?

444
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,100
No worries, you can take a break here.

445
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,589
I'll go to my gig.

446
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:38,579
I'll treat you guys to drinks tonight.

447
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,549
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

448
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,349
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

449
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,890
Old Hu is always so friendly.

450
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,580
Especially to girls.

451
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,710
Xiaochun.

452
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm at the cafe.

453
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,920
<i>[Youfeng Cafe: Tea, Drinks, Refreshents]</i>

454
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:08,779
Ms. Li, this is Xie Zhiyao, my elder brother.

455
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,499
Brother, this is Ms. Li.

456
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:13,040
A Chinese language teacher in elementary school. Right?

457
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,189
Since it's your first meeting, how about...

458
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:17,100
a handshake?

459
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,270
Nice to meet you, too.

460
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,360
This is the porcini pancake.

461
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,650
Thank you.

462
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,300
You're welcome.

463
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,159
This is our brochure.

464
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,799
It introduces all the scenic spots and interesting places in the village and near the town.

465
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,870
You can have a look.

466
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,919
This is a hand-drawn map.

467
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,989
You can go for a stroll after lunch.

468
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,149
Can I take this with me?

469
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,640
Sure.

470
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,629
This is made from persimmons, walnuts, and raisins.

471
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,290
It's super nutritious. Have a bite later. All right?

472
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,380
What an awkward blind date.

473
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,909
Do they share the last name of Xie?

474
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,429
Are they cousins?

475
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,819
Not exactly.

476
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,909
Chairman Xie is 32 years old.

477
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,590
Xiaochun is about 28 years old.

478
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,430
They are family in a sense.

479
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,739
You can think of them as relatives from the same village,

480
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,290
but they get along really well.

481
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,810
32?

482
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,439
This is Autumn Dew. That‘s Indigo Naturalis.

483
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,789
Oh, you're right. Sorry for the lack of knowledge.

484
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:33,939
Chairman Xie's entire family isn't as anxious as Xiaochun.

485
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:37,569
She's dying to get him a girlfriend all day every day.

486
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,770
Sister Na Na!

487
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,240
Yes?

488
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,410
Sister Na Na, I want to eat pancakes.

489
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,259
Didn't you just have lunch?

490
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,819
Why do you want pancakes now?

491
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,389
Have you finished your spelling exercise?

492
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,710
But I want pancakes.

493
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,330
Here, take this.

494
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,189
Say thank you to Sister Hongdou.

495
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,579
Thank you, Sister Hongdou.

496
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,330
Don't mention it.

497
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,960
Thank you, Sister.

498
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,650
Whose kids are they?

499
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,989
Xiao Hu Lu is Xiaochun's child.

500
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,649
Guobao is the child of Yang Guanjun who sells barbecue at night at the junction.

501
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,469
Xiaochun's daughter?

502
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,710
Is she married?

503
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,259
She got divorced.

504
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,659
Her ex-husband is in Kunming. The custody of the child went to her.

505
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:41,740
<i>Waitress.</i>

506
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,989
Coming!

507
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,210
Enjoy your meal.

508
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,089
Usually, apart from teaching at school, I also like hiking and camping.

509
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,379
By the way, I also organized a camping squad in our elementary school.

510
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,870
A camping squad!

511
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,269
- What?
- A camping squad!

512
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,450
That sounds great!

513
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,500
Do you know that my brother is also a huge fan of outdoor activities?

514
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,170
You can tell from his physique.

515
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,779
What's more, he loves horseriding.

516
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,269
He has a horse with a really lovely name. It's called Cutie Pie.

517
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:19,409
Keep your voice down. Don't disturb the other customers.

518
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:21,420
I see.

519
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,260
It's sweet.

520
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,369
- But not too sweet, right?
- Yeah.

521
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,629
It's refreshing.

522
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,651
- Let me get you some more tea. Here you go.
- Sure.

523
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:36,810
<i>Thank you, Xiaochun.</i>

524
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,370
<i>Thank you.</i>

525
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,519
You can make yourself at home here. Don't be a stranger.

526
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,330
Okay.

527
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,820
♫ <i>The sun will rise and fall</i> ♫

528
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,020
♫ <i>It's just another day</i> ♫

529
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,390
Feel free to look around and find something you might need.

530
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,760
Did you make all the crafts here?

531
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,589
Nope. My master and the other craftsmen in the village sell them here after they carve them.

532
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:36,490
I'm just a rookie with a few years of experience. I can't make such masterpieces.

533
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,570
What's that?

534
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,640
I carved it for fun.

535
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,290
It's interesting.

536
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,200
Really?

537
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,890
This woman looks furious,

538
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,690
but also rather comical.

539
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,380
Who is she?

540
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,020
My older sister.

541
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,340
Your older sister?

542
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,500
She looks like my older sister.

543
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,050
- Did you come over from the cafe next door?
- Yeah.

544
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,420
You share a yard anyway.

545
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,890
My sister runs that cafe.

546
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,299
Is Xie Xiaochun your sister?

547
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,629
Do you know my sister?

548
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,639
I rented a room here. I just arrived yesterday.

549
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:26,890
Oh, you're the new tenant at the courtyard.

550
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm Xie Xiaoxia.

551
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,340
I'm Xu Hongdou.

552
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,910
Xu Hongdou.

553
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,330
You can have this for fun.

554
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,430
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

555
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,990
- Come over when you're free.
- Okay.

556
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,600
Bye-bye.

557
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,980
♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫

558
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,640
♫ <i>Enjoy the mountainous landscape at sunset</i> ♫

559
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:28,279
♫ <i>The raindrops from the roof drip into my eyes quietly</i> ♫

560
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:33,740
♫ <i>The world is like a quiet island</i> ♫

561
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,890
You should know the way now. Make sure to visit us again.

562
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,250
Here you go.

563
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,279
Thank you, Sister Xiaochun. I'm so glad to meet you. I'll definitely come again.

564
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,179
This is our new tea.

565
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,890
You must try it.

566
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,869
Thank you for the gift.

567
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,869
Bye-bye.

568
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,619
You're welcome. Come again when you have the time.

569
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,679
- Take care.
- Okay.

570
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,900
Do come again!

571
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,600
Bye-bye.

572
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,850
Are you keen on Ms. Li?

573
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,619
Yes.

574
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,309
I think Ms. Li is great.

575
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,030
How about marrying her?

576
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,989
You make it sound like she'll marry me once I propose.

577
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,369
She's not interested in me.

578
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,569
How can that be?

579
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:17,050
If she's not interested in you, why did she want to add you on WeChat?

580
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,659
Listen up. Now that you added her on WeChat,

581
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,490
you should talk to her more often.

582
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,829
Make friends with her first.

583
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,300
Ms. Li is really nice.

584
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,320
Yes, she is.

585
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,909
As for Xia Xia...

586
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,790
Don't change the subject!

587
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,019
I got it.

588
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,309
I've added her on WeChat.

589
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,649
She's a nice woman.

590
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,539
We can be friends first.

591
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,939
Don't try to placate me. Make sure you take the initiative.

592
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,039
Okay.

593
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,349
So, what about Xia Xia?

594
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,930
Why is he suddenly heading to Shanghai?

595
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,440
Did my mom tell you?

596
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,090
Recently, he got to know a friend in Shanghai.

597
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,189
He was invited over, so he wants to meet up with his friend.

598
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,289
A friend from Shanghai?

599
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,579
Male or female?

600
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,539
He said the friend is male.

601
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,690
They made friends while playing video games.

602
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,429
But I doubt so.

603
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,499
These days, he takes his phone with him to the bathroom.

604
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,270
I'm guessing he's dating someone online.

605
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,370
So, Xia Xia has reached the age for dating.

606
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,989
My mom doesn't share this opinion.

607
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,480
She thinks Xia Xia wants to get a job in Shanghai.

608
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,120
In that case,

609
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,340
you can't stop him anymore since he's an adult.

610
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,959
If he wants to have fun in Shanghai, let him go.

611
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:35,070
If he's determined to find a job there,

612
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,920
then let him go ahead.

613
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,810
But... his master has been in a terrible mood lately.

614
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,649
A few years ago, his son insisted on venturing into machine carving.

615
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:48,849
He was so furious that his high blood pressure acted up and he had to be hospitalized.

616
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,519
Later, he was given the title of the state inheritor of intangible cultural heritage.

617
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,699
He felt the need to pass on his craft.

618
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,660
So, he took in a dozen apprentices.

619
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,620
In the end, these apprentices slowly left.

620
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,519
Xia Xia is the one who has learned from him for the longest time.

621
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,869
Besides, they're from the same village.

622
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,219
So, they're related in a sense.

623
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,850
He pays quite a lot of attention to Xia Xia.

624
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,230
If Xia Xia leaves him,

625
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,930
I'm worried he won't be able to take it.

626
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,300
He can't, but he has to.

627
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,360
My granny once said this.

628
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,280
Times have changed.

629
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,699
Deeply buried gold cannot shine.

630
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,809
The platform for traditional handicrafts is shrinking.

631
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,989
If people are unaware of such valuable things, there won't be a market for them either.

632
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,600
His apprentices have picked up his craft,

633
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,349
but they can't make any money.

634
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,180
They have no choice but to leave.

635
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,770
You're right.

636
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,140
Even when you offered to market his pieces,

637
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,200
he even rejected you because he thinks advertisements are lies.

638
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,489
How about this? I'll invite Xia Xia over for dinner tonight and talk to him about this.

639
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,219
Thank you, Brother.

640
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,800
Anytime.

641
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,099
This is uneven.

642
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
I'll show you.

643
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,489
Look carefully. Okay.

644
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:09,329
Take as many pictures as you can. These can be used for advertisement.

645
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,909
You should start embroidering there.

646
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,630
Yes, only then will the color be uniform.

647
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,500
You can lower this a little.

648
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,519
<i>Mommy! Mommy! I caught a butterfly.</i>

649
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,829
<i>A'Yao.</i>

650
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,249
<i>Butterflies are beneficial insects that can spread pollen to help crops grow.</i>

651
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:32,180
<i>Set it free.</i>

652
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,339
<i>A'Yao, come here.</i>

653
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,269
<i>I'll make you a hat with a lotus on it.</i>

654
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,829
<i>I don't want a lotus. Only girls have flowers on their hats.</i>

655
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:41,750
<i>Well, what do you like?</i>

656
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,950
<i>A butterfly.</i>

657
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,540
<i>Okay, I'll embroider a butterfly. Come over.</i>

658
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,210
Okay. Cut. It's a wrap.

659
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,689
- Ms. Xie, thank you for your hard work. Thank you.
- It's nothing.

660
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:57,309
- Let's take a picture together.
- Sure.

661
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:59,409
- Let me take a picture for you!
- Join us.

662
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,919
Join us, Chairman Xie.

663
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,870
I don't want to butt in.

664
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,810
Guys, hurry up.

665
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,800
Look at the camera. Let me adjust it a little bit.

666
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,430
Okay. One, two, three.

667
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,499
Done.

668
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,430
Okay. Thanks a lot.

669
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,820
Anytime. Take care.

670
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,350
Okay.

671
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,039
- Director Liu, I'll send you the materials via email after I export them tonight.
- No problem.

672
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,000
I need to discuss something else with you.

673
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,039
Director Liu, does your TV station have a program for wood carving?

674
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,309
I have someone to recommend to you.

675
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,699
A municipal inheritor of intangible cultural heritage.

676
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,429
He was given the title even earlier than Ms. Xie,

677
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,670
but he's a veteran craftsman who keeps a low profile.

678
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,290
We just went to Jianchuan last month.

679
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,489
- It's fine.
- There may be opportunities in the future.

680
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:42,549
- Sure.
- Talk to you next time.

681
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,330
No problem.

682
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,530
Okay. I'll see myself out.

683
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,429
- Gezi, please walk Director Liu out.
- Okay.

684
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:52,140
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

685
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,070
- Let me take this for you.
- Take care.

686
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,120
Have they left?

687
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,030
Aunty,

688
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,559
you had an exhausting day. Go home early and get some rest.

689
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,649
I'm not tired.

690
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:19,020
I didn't even do any physical labor.

691
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,270
When they were filming just now,

692
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,589
I was thinking that if Mom didn't give up on embroidery to work,

693
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:31,900
she would be with you on the show right now.

694
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,869
If your mom didn't work,

695
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,390
how could she have paid for your education?

696
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,889
I didn't have a child to raise.

697
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,640
Otherwise, I would've left the village

698
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,210
to work with your mom.

699
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,240
Do you miss your mom?

700
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,519
You were still in junior high school when your mom passed away.

701
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,650
It's been 20 years now.

702
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,370
How time flies.

703
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,870
A'Yao,

704
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,960
have a taste.

705
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,270
Perfect.

706
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,440
<i>Granny!</i>

707
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,890
<i>Granny! I'm hungry!</i>

708
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,619
Give Xia Xia a call.

709
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,069
Ask him if he's close by.

710
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:39,130
I called him. He said he'll be here soon.

711
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,869
Take a shower before you eat.

712
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,480
You stink! You're gross!

713
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,340
I've washed my hands.

714
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,389
Why did you kick me?

715
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:52,880
Shower.

716
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,780
Granny!

717
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,229
It's fine to scold him, but why did you beat him?

718
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,720
Granny, you can't pamper him.

719
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,619
You didn't treat me like this when I was a child.

720
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,209
We're living in different times.

721
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:06,729
Beating others isn't right. It's uncivilized.

722
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:09,600
Yes, uncivilized.

723
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,829
You've had enough fun at home.

724
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,400
It's time for you to go back to school in Kunming.

725
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,469
Did you hear what Granny said?

726
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,949
She wants you to return to school in Kunming.

727
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,169
You've stayed at home for a month.

728
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,990
If you don't go back to school, you won't be able to keep up.

729
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,700
I don't want to go back.

730
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,350
You have to attend school!

731
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,629
Granny! I don't want to go to school!

732
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:35,169
I want to stay here. I want to rear horses.

733
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,909
Brother, you can venture out for your career.

734
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,190
I'll stay here and take care of Granny.

735
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,949
You need someone to serve you all three meals

736
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,499
and you don't even know how to wash dishes.

737
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,999
You scamper around the village like a stray dog and no one can find you.

738
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,720
How can you take care of Granny?

739
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,949
That's because you're around and I'm not needed.

740
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,590
Right, Granny?

741
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,309
Why did you kick me again?

742
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,400
Granny!

743
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,579
Why did you hit him again?

744
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,820
Granny, you won't let me hit him, but why did you hit me?!

745
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,159
I didn't hit you. I just tapped you lightly.

746
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,690
Right. A light tap.

747
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,810
I'm sorry, Brother!

748
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,309
Get on with cooking.
