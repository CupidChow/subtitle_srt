3
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,481
Dad, your waist is frail. Don't squat there.

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,440
Let me do it. Stop for now.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,790
I'm almost done.

6
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,240
- Stand up.
- Okay.

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,850
I'll do it. Sit over there.

8
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,840
Come on. Sit down.

9
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,550
I'm fine.

10
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,560
Here.

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,860
Have some rest. Drink some tea.

12
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,998
We've been living here for over 20 years.

13
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:24,128
Mi and you grew up in this house.

14
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,568
We spent ¥40,000 on this house.

15
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,734
Just ¥40,000?

16
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,740
It wasn't a small sum back then.

17
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,340
Really?

18
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,930
Dad, are we selling this house?

19
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,930
Nope. Your mom can't bear to sell it.

20
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,600
She wants to tidy up the rooms and rent it out.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,200
There's a junior high school in front of our estate and a high school behind it.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,940
it's an easy place to rent out.

23
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,712
You drew all those.

24
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,400
What did I draw?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,504
Isn't it written there?

26
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,330
The beautiful and confident boss, Xu Hongdou.

27
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,430
The beggar, Xu Hongmi.

28
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,520
When did I draw that?

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,220
Was I that eager to be a boss when I was little?

30
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,790
We moved over here when you were in elementary school,

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,870
about seven years old.

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,220
Thinking back now,

33
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,410
you guys were such fascinating children.

34
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,248
When school was over, you'd rush over to my grocery store.

35
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,590
Xiao Zhang, who sold condiments next door, would ask why you came over.

36
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,460
You said you were there to pick up your dad.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,200
Once you were a boss in the future,

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,980
you'd forbid me from selling rice.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,520
Don't you still want to open a grocery store now?

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,880
That's right.

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,820
I've been busy working all my life.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,026
It's boring to have fun all day long.

43
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:06,960
You can do housework, cook, and exercise with Mom.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,252
That's quite enjoyable.

45
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,410
Your expenses aren't high either, and you have savings.

46
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,520
Sister and I can support you two.

47
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,430
Yes.

48
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,998
Days pass by.

49
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:26,870
We're just getting old... and useless.

50
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,214
How can you think this way?

51
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,990
Who said that?

52
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,070
Why are you useless just because you're old? Everyone gets old, right?

53
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,460
You're only sixty years old. You're still young.

54
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,400
Since I'm still young, why won't you let me set up a grocery store?

55
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,090
Setting up a grocery store is a business venture.

56
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,506
It's stressful to manage a new business.

57
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,030
Isn't that right?

58
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,648
Once you've made your decision, there's no turning back.

59
00:04:55,648 --> 00:05:00,666
You may think it's easy to set up a grocery store.

60
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,730
All you need is a small shop front,

61
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,450
but the operations are complicated.

62
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,500
Firstly, you need to buy a shop front.

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,584
Then, there's the rental

64
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,530
and the renovation fees.

65
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,150
You still have to bring in goods.

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,188
The types of goods,

67
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:22,170
finding a cheap supplier, deciding on the retail prices,

68
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,410
figuring out the profits needed to cover your costs...

69
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,960
Dad, have you considered these?

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,310
It's not that I'm stopping you from working.

71
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,846
I just don't want you to set up a grocery store.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,180
I've been the boss of a grocery store all my life.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,816
What else can I do?

74
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:49,000
Our estate was recruiting security guards.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,648
I went to inquire.

76
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:52,908
They said I was too old.

77
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,100
The parking lot of the company

78
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,234
that Kexin's husband works at needed a guard.

79
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,390
There weren't any age restrictions,

80
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,580
but there were night shifts.

81
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,306
I was worried that I couldn't stay up late.

82
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,450
Dad, my sister and I think...

83
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,510
you've been working all your life.

84
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,870
Now that you're over sixty years old,

85
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,540
we want you to lead a worry-free and happy life.

86
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm happy. Of course, I'm happy.

87
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,928
We live in a peaceful age.

88
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,940
Your mom and I have a harmonious marriage, and we're healthy.

89
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,530
Our daughters are filial.

90
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,600
We don't have to worry about food or clothes.

91
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,230
How can I be unhappy? I'm extremely blessed.

92
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,020
But if I can find work and contribute to the family,

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,332
I'd be even more content.

94
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,720
All right.

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,700
I'll ponder over this for you.

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,988
<i>[The beautiful and confident boss, Xu Hongdou. The beggar, Xu Hongmi]</i>

97
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,560
At that time, you were so little.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,760
In the blink of an eye...

99
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,700
Dad, what if I start a business and be the boss?

100
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,960
Enough.

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,012
It's a serious question.

102
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:21,720
Are you keen on setting up a grocery store, too?

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,688
I won't do that.

104
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,410
Why can't I set up a big hotel?

105
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,990
Of course, you can.

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,850
I'm serious.

107
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,734
I'm also serious.

108
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:33,460
I think you can pull off anything.

109
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,970
- Really?
- Yes.

110
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,360
Hello, Kexin. What do you want to eat?

111
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,290
How could you let Kexin pick up parcels on her own?

112
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,950
You're so careless.

113
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,750
What if she's hurt?

114
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,150
It's okay.

115
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,830
Please don't crowd at the door.

116
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,800
Save my wife first!

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
What did you say? There is no such rule here. We'll do our best to save them.

118
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,640
We'll do our best to save them.

119
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,070
What's the situation right now?

120
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,326
Doctor, save both of them.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,881
- Don't worry.
- Doctor!

122
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,400
Don't worry. Sit down. Don't panic.

123
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,896
<i>[Surgery]</i>

124
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,870
The doctor is here.

125
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,853
Yang Kexin's family, here's the baby.

126
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,080
Is the mother all right?

127
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,491
Congratulations. Both of them are safe.

128
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,080
Thank you.

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Second Sister, you can hug her.

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,870
Come on.

131
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,220
You'll be the first relative to carry her. Look at her.

132
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,084
She's so cute.

133
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:50,532
Your aunt and uncle went back to make nutritious meals for you.

134
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:53,820
Your husband and mother-in-law went to pack things.

135
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,670
Your parents went with the baby for checkups.

136
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,830
They're fine, don't worry.

137
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,960
Second Sister,

138
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,770
will the baby by injured because I fell?

139
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,220
The baby is doing well.

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,596
Even though this was an early birth, the baby is fully grown.

141
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:14,190
You underwent surgery once you got here, so she didn't lack oxygen.

142
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,070
Don't worry.

143
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,790
You scared me to death with your call.

144
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,974
You sounded like you were reciting your will.

145
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:29,406
I didn't know if I'd be fine.

146
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:33,332
If anything happened, I would've lost my chance to say my last words.

147
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,860
While I was waiting for the ambulance,

148
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,658
so many thoughts ran through my mind.

149
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:42,600
I didn't want anything else.

150
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,914
I just wanted to be alive.

151
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,568
Yesterday, I even quarreled with my mom.

152
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,422
I regretted that.

153
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,534
The baby isn't big,

154
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,870
and the position of the fetus was fine.

155
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,390
I even bought a constellation bracelet for her.

156
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,046
I wanted to have a normal childbirth,

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,092
but I bought that for nothing.

158
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,634
We didn't even make any preparations.

159
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:10,490
There are too many unexpected occurrences in one's life.

160
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,410
Don't harp on this.

161
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,050
Have some rest.

162
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,150
Is your cousin all right?

163
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,490
<i>She's fine.</i>

164
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,170
<i>You didn't see how my relatives were.</i>

165
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,810
This is the first time I saw them in such panic.

166
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,522
My aunt couldn't even stand.

167
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,610
You were terrified too, weren't you?

168
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,960
<i>Of course.</i>

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,870
<i>She suddenly called me and said her last words.</i>

170
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,650
She scared the hell out of me.

171
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,448
I can't even fall asleep now.

172
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:44,066
I'm scared.

173
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,750
How about... I fly over to you tomorrow?

174
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,310
Why do you want to come over?

175
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,640
I... I just want to see you.

176
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm just kidding.

177
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,200
<i>I just sent off the company you recommended to us for team bonding.</i>

178
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,390
I've been busy selling potatoes lately as well.

179
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,680
I don't have any free time.

180
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,420
You were just kidding?

181
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,620
If I need you in Beijing, will you come over?

182
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,120
Of course.

183
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,050
I'm serious. I'm not kidding.

184
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,920
Get to work. Sleep early.

185
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,200
Okay.

186
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,860
Don't think too much.

187
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,520
You still need to care for your cousin at the hospital tomorrow.

188
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,240
By the way,

189
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,050
the plums you sent over turned sweeter after a few days.

190
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,650
They're delicious.

191
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,624
Your stomach will hurt if you eat too many. Don't eat too much.

192
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,850
I'm hanging up.

193
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>- Old Xie! Old Xie!</i>
- Yeah?

194
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,870
Wake up! Come on!

195
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,291
What? What happened?

196
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,730
Calm down and tell me. What's wrong?

197
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,180
We made it!

198
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,360
What?

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,020
The bookstore. The bookstore just called me.

200
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
We made it!

201
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,490
- We made it?
- Yes!

202
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,570
- Really?
- Yes!

203
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,730
We made it!

204
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,120
I'll take these off first.

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,872
We must celebrate with good food tonight!

206
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,920
Really? Really?

207
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,750
<i>That's great. You made it!</i>

208
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,940
<i>Yes. We finally sealed the deal.</i>

209
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,414
Congratulations.

210
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,020
<i>Shouldn't you share in our joy?</i>

211
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,240
<i>You contributed to this.</i>

212
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,430
You contributed even more. You've done a wonderful job of building up Yunmiao Village.

213
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,900
- Xu Hongdou.
- Yeah.

214
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,196
If, and I mean if...

215
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:16,730

216
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,146

219
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,814

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,244
What can I even do there?

221
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,170
There's nothing here now, and developments aren't optimistic.

222
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,170
I'm talking about the future.

227

I don't just blabber jokes.

Don't say that.

Well, I have nothing else to say.

I'll skip breakfast.

Five minutes!

247

What are you doing?

248
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,810
Stop this nonsense!

249
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,050
Mom, she sleeps until noon every day.

250
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,340
Aren't you going to say something about this?

251
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,930
She's been accompanying Kexin at the hospital.

252
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,390
She slept late last night.

253
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,990
Just leave her be. Come on.

254
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,180
- Hongmi, have breakfast.
- When did you come back?

255
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,618
Why can't I be back?

256
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,372
I heard about Kexin's fall after we moved houses.

257
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,752
So, I came back during the weekend to lecture you.

258
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:51,320
- Where is Lingdang?
- She didn't come with me.

259
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,150
- Wake up!
- What are you doing?

260
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,320
Wake up!

261
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Accompany me to the hospital to visit Kexin after breakfast.

262
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Five minutes.

263
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,000
You won't even get five seconds.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,160
<i>Wake up! The noodles are clumping together!</i>

265
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,200
<i>Come on! Have breakfast!</i>

266
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,510
Get moving! Wake up!

267
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,510
You lazy pig!

268
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,431
Mom, this pig is ready to be slaughtered.

269
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,240
Wake up.

270
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,700
On that day,

271
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,838
Dou and your dad went to the old house to clean.

272
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,860
Your aunt called me while wailing.

273
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,708
She said Kexin had a fall.

274
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:38,154
I was so shocked that my heart almost leapt out of my chest.

275
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,650
Kexin's husband was in utter panic.

276
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,418
He was like a fool in the hospital.

277
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,990
Luckily, Dou was there.

278
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,970
The whole family was panicking.

279
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,220
Dou was the only one helping out quietly.

280
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,176
She's useful now that she's grown up.

281
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:57,772
Yes, it's about time she grew sensible.

282
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,058
Your mom is a master chef.

283
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,350
It's a pity that you don't own a restaurant.

284
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,110
- Absolutely.
- Don't eat too fast.

285
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,310
Don't eat too much. It's bad for your blood sugar levels.

286
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,942
You can eat more.

287
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:08,970
I'll eat less, I'm on a diet.

288
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,286
Eat more.

289
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,780
She's smiling.

290
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,090
Did she fall asleep?

291
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,130
It has been a long time since I carried a baby.

292
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,730
Well done, Big Sister.

293
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,400
Second Sister doesn't dare to carry her.

294
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,880
She said the baby's too small and fragile.

295
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,740
She's afraid of hurting the baby.

296
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,550
What if your hotel guests need you to carry their babies?

297
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,050
I'll do it.

298
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,586
By the way, Big Sister,

299
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,930
have you watched the promotional video Second Sister helped with

300
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,780
during her trip to Yunnan?

301
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,724
Yes, what about it?

302
00:18:55,724 --> 00:19:01,356
Did you meet the guy she was holding hands with at the seaside?

303
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,550
What do you think of him?

304
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,890
Just so-so.

305
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,028
I think he's pretty handsome.

306
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,824
He's too poor.

307
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:14,520
Poor?

308
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,580
He's starting a business. You know this.

309
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,934
His business is booming as well.

310
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:26,128
When you were there, he took good care of you, didn't he?

311
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:28,294
Now, you're complaining that he's poor.

312
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:30,100
There's something wrong with you.

313
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,131
I just said he's poor. Why are you so pissed off?

314
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,338
I just think you're wrong to say that.

315
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:38,002
Why can't I criticize him?

316
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,920
Why are you so pushy?

317
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,676
Am I pushy?

318
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,880
Am I pushy?

319
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,472
Am I pushy? I'll keep quiet.

320
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,192
Hilarious.

321
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,198
Can't you help me?

322
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:06,321
Do it yourself. I'm busy with work.

323
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
- The bookstore?
- Yeah.

324
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
They'll come over to select a site in a few days.

325
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,210
It's good to be busy with work.

326
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,590
Once you settled the deal with the bookstore, you've recovered.

327
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,660
Look at how you were a while back.

328
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,820
You were strange. I'm not used to that.

329
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,740
Well, get used to it.

330
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,590
Let me tell you this. I have a premonition.

331
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,972
With just another two years of hard work until the bookstore is built,

332
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,226
I'll get married.

333
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,150
What? After the bookstore is built,

334
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,210
will the village committee send you a wife?

335
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,510
That's right.

336
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,802
The heavens will give me a wife.

337
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,620
I just said you recovered.

338
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,580
Have you lost your marbles again?

339
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,900
Xu Hongdou has been gone for a long time.

340
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,400
You're still so insane.

341
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,981
- That's none of your business.
- I don't give a damn.

342
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:07,100
Uncle A'Yao. Brother Guanjun.

343
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,450
Am I pretty? My boyfriend gave it to me.

344
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,403
Another lunatic.

345
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,180
It's pretty.

346
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,200
Uncle A'Yao, will you treat us to a meal today?

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,600
Yeah, I will.

348
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,740
Xiao Qin, didn't you break up with Yang Zhinan?

349
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,630
No, I didn't.

350
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,998
Why not?

351
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,170
Lovers are bound to quarrel.

352
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,450
Without fights and separations,

353
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,570
a relationship will be uneventful and boring.

354
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,048
But you're just torturing yourself.

355
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:49,952
Love requires trials and obstacles.

356
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,951
Forget it. Why am I chatting with you about this?

357
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:53,450
You won't understand.

358
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,900
Don't you agree, Uncle A'Yao?

359
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,060
Yes. Love should be tested by hardships,

360
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,490
but these shouldn't be so frequent.

361
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,890
Don't threaten to break up with him all the time.

362
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,700
Weren't you the one who encouraged my breakup?

363
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,170
Well, will you do everything I say?

364
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,650
Why don't you listen to your dad's advice?

365
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,679
I suggested breaking up to drill the severity of this problem into his head.

366
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,104
Besides, I did that in a fit of anger. I didn't really mean to break up.

367
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:21,910
After all, Yang Zhinan is so handsome and honest.

368
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,242
I can't let others have him.

369
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,878
He's that great?

370
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,540
A'Yao, have you met him before?

371
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,650
Yes.

372
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,350
He looks... sprightly.

373
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,720
He's not just sprightly.

374
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,630
He's very dashing. He looks like a celebrity.

375
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,060
Which one?

376
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,980
That's none of your business.

377
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,340
Uncle A'Yao, don't give up.

378
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,210
Although you're old and tan, you have to believe

379
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,738
that even wild lilies have their springs.

380
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:57,610
You can have beautiful love just like me.

381
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,412
Beautiful love?

382
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:02,682
It's clear that he's gone mad.

383
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,920
He's gone crazy yearning for a woman.

384
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,620
He was fantasizing that the village committee will give him a wife

385
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,460
once the bookstore is built.

386
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,062
I have a strong hunch and absolute confidence about this.

387
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:17,760
After the bookstore is built, I'll be married.

388
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,900
See? Isn't he insane?

389
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,690
This has been put off for too long.

390
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,970
Hand it in to me tomorrow.

391
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,690
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

392
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,511
- Let go of me.
- Bring back my slippers.
- Nope.

393
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,650
You won't? Will you do it or not?

394
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,880
- Okay.
- Will you do it?

395
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,110
Okay. I'll do it.

396
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,900
Let go.

397
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,244
Xu Hongmi.

398
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,430
Xu Hongdou.

399
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,908
Before I decide on your burial spot, bring back my slippers.

400
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:43,900
Five.

401
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,000
Four.

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,900
Three.

403
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Two.

404
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,400
One.

405
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,060
Dumplings again?

406
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,200
Your sister is back.

407
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,140
Of course, we should eat dumplings.

408
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,450
I'll help you with them.

409
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,540
There's no need.

410
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,140
Hang out with your sister.

411
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,460
Her? She's planning to murder and bury me.

412
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,410
I'll bury you here.

413
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,410
Your ages add up to over 70 years old.

414
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,990
Why are you still acting like kids?

415
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,140
Your ages probably add up to over 100 years old.

416
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,640
You're the same as well.

417
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,030
Mom, what are you doing?

418
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,270
I can't live with your dad anymore.

419
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,570
You can choose one of us.

420
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,584
You got into another fight?

421
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:28,690
I choose my sister.

422
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,790
Get lost.

423
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,360
Dad, what's this argument about?

424
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,450
I said I won't set up a grocery store.

425
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,210
I just want to get a job.

426
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,762
She flared up.

427
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:44,788
Get a job?

428
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,630
Let's have a meeting.

429
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,068
I just want to work.

430
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,480
Okay. Here you go.

431
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,090
President, here is your tea.

432
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,100
Let's commence the meeting.

433
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,240
Xiao Liu, your disagreement is the strongest. You can start first.

434
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,210
What did you call me?

435
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,958
Be careful, it's hot.

436
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,470
Please share your opinions.

437
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,950
Fine, I'll start.

438
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,530
Xu Jianguo, we have a clear division of labor.

439
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,860
You work while I care for the family.

440
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,640
We have elders and children to care for.

441
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,410
We support the whole family together.

442
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,310
No, you support the family more than I do.

443
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,820
Don't be humble.

444
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,930
You've sacrificed a lot for this family.

445
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,780
We can see that.

446
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,650
You sold grains and oil, but how much can you earn from a bag of rice?

447
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,590
You just wanted to save money.

448
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,970
You never hired others.

449
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,750
You unloaded all the goods yourself.

450
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,730
You worked from day to night, and now what?

451
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,030
You have a problem with your lower back.

452
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,400
You're right.

453
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,832
My lower back...

454
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,310
Why are you praising me now?

455
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,780
Of course, I should praise you.

456
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,550
I should praise you if you do well.

457
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,590
You should be praised if you deserve it.

458
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,440
I'm just being honest.

459
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,080
I've always been fair, just, and...

460
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,580
- Gracious.
- Gracious.

461
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,340
Your family was poor, and you didn't even graduate from junior high.

462
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,430
Why? You wanted to earn money, so you started working.

463
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,690
But I'm different.

464
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,820
I graduated from a technical school.

465
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,348
At that time, I was the most literate person in my family.

466
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:28,150
When the neighbors had conflicts,

467
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,030
they'd get me to mediate.

468
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,150
Mom is the best.

469
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,480
So, how can I possibly wrong you?

470
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,360
Yes, you're right.

471
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,690
I can understand your desire to get a job,

472
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,962
but I don't want to worry about you anymore.

473
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,300
Look at your lower back.

474
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,970
You can't sit or stand because of the pain.

475
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,700
I went to the hospital with you, didn't I?

476
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,730
I accompanied you for acupuncture and even collected your medicine.

477
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,170
When you were hospitalized, I rented a folding bed.

478
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,450
I lived in the hospital corridor.

479
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,290
It was winter. The wind was gusting.

480
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,070
I had a fever that lasted as long as your hospitalization.

481
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,976
You should've called us and told us!

482
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,210
That's useless!

483
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,630
All of you were working miles away!

484
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,546
Why would I bother you and make you come back?

485
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:14,960
Think about it, Xu Jianguo.

486
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,796
We're getting old now.

487
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:22,010
Aren't we supporting their careers just by being healthy and safe?

488
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,140
Yes. So, I'm not setting up a grocery store.

489
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,440
Dou broke it down for me and criticized me.

490
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,100
I admit that I was too naive with my assumptions.

491
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,271
You're so old now! What can you even do?

492
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:42,230
Even a security guard needs to be under 45 years old. You're too old for that.

493
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,550
What can you do now?

494
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,170
Being a warehouse guard or running a boiler?

495
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,650
All these are night shifts.

496
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,450
How can you do that with your condition?

497
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,810
The money you earn can't even cover your hospital bills.

498
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,820
Dad, you really can't get a job that'll harm your body,

499
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,290
but I support his desire to work.

500
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,370
Listen to what Dou just said.

501
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:09,030
I... I can rent some fields in the countryside and farm.

502
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,030
You think you can do that?

503
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,920
Look at the garlic you planted in the flower pot.

504
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,951
Did it grow? Did it?

505
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:19,170
I was born in a family of farmers.

506
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,540
You can't farm in the fields.

507
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,580
You need to bend over just to farm under the hot sun.

508
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,380
Your back will break.

509
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,750
But...

510
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,516
I know nothing else.

511
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,650
I've only sold grains for my whole life.

512
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,951
Don't be so humble. You also know how to eat grains.

513
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,392
We're having a meeting. Why are you dishing out insults?

514
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:37,820
You can't say that, Guiqin.

515
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,250
You're saying that I'm a pig.

516
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,960
You... I oppose that.

517
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,520
Opposition sustained. Mom, don't insult others.

518
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,070
Okay, fine. I'll stop with the nonsense.

519
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,860
You two, listen carefully.

520
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,620
- If you find an easy job, I'll give you my support.
- Okay.

521
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,310
But if it's harmful to your body, that's an absolute no.

522
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,820
Mom, let's work toward this target.

523
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,490
We should think of a solution.

524
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,930
Yes, think of a solution.

525
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,620
Dad, don't harbor too much hope.

526
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,172
Well, why did you even talk about it?

527
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:21,060
Dad, our estate's committee needs a volunteer.

528
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,440
That won't do.

529
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,120
I want to make money.

530
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,200
See? A money-grubber.

531
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,170
Enough, let's cook the dumplings.

532
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,300
Hold on.

533
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,240
Since my sister is here today, I have something to inform everyone.

534
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,900
What is it? Why are you so secretive?

535
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,345
I bet it's not good news.

536
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:40,960
Listen to Dou. Let her speak.

537
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,320
Dad, Mom, Sister.

538
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,679
I've made thorough considerations, and this isn't just a whim.

539
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,224
I've decided to seize the day.

540
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:53,170
This is also what I'm most keen on doing now.

541
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,780
I think it's meaningful,

542
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,350
a wonderful opportunity, and has great prospects.

543
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,410
Don't beat around the bush. Cut to the chase.

544
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,210
Just let me share my thoughts.

545
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,462
Okay, go on.

546
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,530
Dear family, I... don't want to return to Beijing to work for now.

547
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,232
I want to buy and run the homestay in Yunmiao Village.

548
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:21,730
According to reliable sources, the takeover price is cheap.

549
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,650
Moreover, Shaohua Bookstore will be built next to it.

550
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,540
It's the perfect time to buy the place now.

551
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,310
I work in hotel management, don't I?

552
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,490
This is my forte.

553
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,678
Moreover, I've found a partner who is willing to buy it with me.

554
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:37,154
We've discussed and made calculations.

555
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:40,590
We can pay the early expenses.

556
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:43,930
As for future plans, we still need some time to flesh that out.

557
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,506
I won't go into the details now.

558
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,619
Well, you mentioned a partner. Right?

559
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:59,140
My VIP customer, Sister Qiu, manages homestay brand building.

560
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,239
She's doing excellently.

561
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,270
She owns many homestays and even wants to rope me in.

562
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,730
I didn't agree. Why not?

563
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,410
That's because I want to build my own brand.

564
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,860
We have differing philosophies.

565
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,704
After that, I found another partner.

566
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:12,410
I won't elaborate on the philosophy.

567
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,930
Once I finish the proposal, I'll show you guys.

568
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,000
- Do you have enough money?
- Yes, for now.

569
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,860
- Come on, let's cook the dumplings.
- I'll peel the garlic.

570
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,756
Xu Hongdou.

571
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:34,540
As expected of someone who started dating with a Drift Bottle.

572
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,870
<i>Mom, I want vegetable dumplings.</i>

573
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,580
<i>Okay.</i>

574
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,500
<i>Can we cook dumplings with the pot for steaming buns?</i>

575
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,700
<i>Look. I can distinguish the dumplings made by you two.</i>

576
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,630
Dumplings are like people, aren't they?

577
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,450
Your dad is stingy, so he made small dumplings.

578
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,660
No way, I think he made this one. Look at this shelf he made.

579
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,910
How can I reach it?

580
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,700
He needs to reach every bowl himself. He deserves it.

581
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,740
I'll help you.

582
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,570
Where is the pepper and chili sauce I bought?

583
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,350
<i>- It's here.</i>
- Mom.

584
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,110
<i>It's here.</i>

585
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,750
So, do you guys approve?

586
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,314
Hey, you should make the sauce delicious.

587
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:11,280
Where is the chili sauce I bought?

588
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,940
I know where it is. It's here.

589
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,940
Add more chili sauce, that'll make it tasty.

590
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,350
It's a perfect balance of flavors.

591
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:27,410
Although your mom was angry, she didn't add more salt.

592
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,414
She deserves to be praised.

593
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,051
Who the heck was angry?

594
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,053
I just couldn't be bothered with you.

595
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:37,133
Mom, did you add dried shrimp with shells in the leek stuffing?

596
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,650
Prawns or dried shrimp won't bring out this taste.

597
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,980
- It tastes good.
- Eat more.

598
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,930
Well,

599
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,910
what do you think about my homestay venture?

600
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,530
Dou, don't talk during meals.

601
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,336
Eat more, here.

602
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:56,318
Have some spiced beef.

603
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:59,050
- Mom.
- Here you go. Delicious?

604
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,930
Yes.

605
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,530
So tasty. Your mom is a marvelous cook.

606
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,340
Chief, it's a pity that you don't own...

607
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,450
A restaurant!

608
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,610
Feels great.

609
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,130
You have to cover your whole face.

610
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,366
Only then will it be effective.

611
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:23,826
It's so refreshing and relaxing.

612
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,760
Do you want one?

613
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,780
She has them.

614
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,958
There's no way she'd buy such expensive facial masks.

615
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,722
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,
and the starry sky</i> ♫

616
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:48,930
♫ <i>Disoriented footsteps will gradually be erased</i> ♫

617
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,760
Mom, let her do it herself.

618
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
No one can beat her at this.

619
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,550
That's true. She majored in this.

620
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,150
Yeah.

621
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,900
I didn't major in making beds.

622
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,140
She's angry now.

623
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,741
All right, fine. Don't be angry.

624
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:06,530
Mom, what do you want to show me?

625
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,581
It's in my room. Take a look at my new bedside table.

626
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,750
Come here.

627
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,680
What's so nice about a bedside table?

628
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,200
Wh-What are you doing?

629
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
Why aren't you in bed?

630
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,300
I can't fall asleep.

631
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
It's 3:00 a.m.

632
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,400
What do you think?

633
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
What are you talking about?

634
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
The homestay.

635
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,500
Ask Mom.

636
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
What a nuisance!

637
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,600
<i>What the heck?</i>

638
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,400
<i>Xu Jianguo, a ghost is grabbing my foot!</i>

639
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,300
<i>What's wrong?</i>

640
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,400
<i>What is it?</i>

641
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
<i>Oh my god!</i>

642
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,600
<i>Xu Hongdou!</i>

643
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,700
<i>You naughty girl.</i>

644
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,400
<i>Why are you squatting there?</i>

645
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
<i>You scared me.</i>

646
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,300
Have some milk.

647
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,300
What are you doing?

648
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,600
Isn't it obvious?

649
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,400
We ignored you on purpose to tease you and make you anxious.

650
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,466
Do you know what Mom told me over the phone?

651
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,800
She said...

652
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
<i>Dou has become wild after leaving home.</i>

653
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,200
<i>She's so pleased when she talks about her friends there.</i>

654
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,200
<i>Who's the one who wants to start a business with her?</i>

655
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,900
<i>Xiao Xie!</i>
- <i>Yes, Xiao Xie.</i>

656
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,800
<i>They'll send peaches and plums to each other.</i>

657
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>They're so clingy.</i>

658
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
<i>They're still so chummy?</i>

659
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,600
<i>So much time has passed.</i>

660
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,800
<i>Exactly. She even asked Li Yulin to send tourists there and drafted proposals.</i>

661
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
<i>They even stay up late to call each other.</i>

662
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,800
<i>I bet they'll start dating.</i>

663
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,500
<i>Really?</i>

664
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,000
<i>We can tell what she's going to do when she budges.</i>

665
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,700
<i>Will you approve?</i>

666
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
<i>Of course! We definitely do!</i>

667
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,600
<i>I'm fine with any guy she's fond of.</i>

668
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,700
<i>I just have one requirement. He needs to be alive.</i>

669
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>Nan Nan...</i>

670
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,300
<i>Kexin also had a fall several days ago.</i>

671
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,500
<i>I still feel anxious thinking about it now.</i>

672
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,700
<i>Mi,</i>

673
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,400
<i>one of them is in Yunnan, and the other is in Beijing.</i>

674
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
<i>How can they even date?</i>

675
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
<i>Cyber dating. That's cyber dating.</i>

676
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>That won't do!</i>

677
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>They have to be together.</i>

678
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,900
<i>Didn't your aunt's daughter marry over to the northeast region?</i>

679
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,600
<i>Right now, they spend half a year in Sanya and the other half in Harbin.</i>

680
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,700
<i>They're enjoying their life.</i>

681
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,000
<i>That's right.</i>

682
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,000
<i>Aunty's daughter has already retired.</i>

683
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
<i>Dou needs to work.</i>

684
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>They'll find a solution.</i>

685
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,200
<i>They can take flights to each other.</i>

686
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>Planes are fast.</i>

687
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,100
<i>Flights? It'll cost a bomb to take flights all the time.</i>

688
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>You don't get it.</i>

689
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,400
<i>Chairman Xie is a boss.</i>

690
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
<i>How can a boss be poor, right?</i>

691
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,400
<i>You're such a money-grubber.</i>

692
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,700
<i>He's rich with tons of loans to pay.</i>

693
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,700
<i>As long as he's nice and they adore each other,</i>

694
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,600
<i>we won't have any objections.</i>

695
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,800
<i>That's right.</i>

696
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,200
<i>Mi, when you were dating,</i>

697
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,600
<i>your mom and I didn't despise your partner either.</i>

698
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>Why would you?</i>

699
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>Would you complain that he has too many houses?</i>

700
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,700
<i>Look at you.</i>

701
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,800
<i>Why are you so brutally honest?</i>

702
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,700
<i>You're such a money-grubber, too.</i>

703
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,100
You should've discussed this with the family first.

704
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,000
Instead, you mulled over this yourself,

705
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,500
and told us only at the very end.

706
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
So what if we ignored you for a bit?

707
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,850
But I needed to think this through alone.

708
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,300
I'm not a fresh college graduate.

709
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,000
Choosing a different path and starting anew

710
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,200
requires courage.

711
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,700
You're right.

712
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,800
I thought you were fond of your former job.

713
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,400
I was,

714
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
but perhaps I had a change of mentality.

715
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:57,000
I feel that I'm so puny and insignificant.

716
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
When I'm standing there,

717
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,000
people can see me.

718
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,400
Yet, I feel like not a single person sees me.

719
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,200
Do you know that when I see the hotel's clock,

720
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,300
I feel like I'm the spring on the clock's hands.

721
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,000
It keeps ticking and pushing me forward,

722
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
but I don't know where I'm headed.

723
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,500
I'm just walking in circles.

724
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,200
I feel that I'm losing sight of myself.

725
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,600
It's so meaningless.

726
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,400
It doesn't matter whether I'm standing there

727
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,500
or someone else takes my place.

728
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,400
It makes no difference to the hotel.

729
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
So,

730
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,800
I only feel like my existence in this city has meaning

731
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,500
when I'm before my best friend.

732
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,300
I'm treasured and respected by someone else.

733
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,400
Sister,

734
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,000
after Nan Nan passed away,

735
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,100
I...

736
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,600
I felt a void in my heart.

737
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,200
I feel...

738
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,900
it's like... my feet can't touch the ground.

739
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,400
I don't know...

740
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
which way to go anymore.

741
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,800
I don't know where I am either.

742
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,300
I don't want to do anything,

743
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,000
and I've lost interest in everything.

744
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Don't cry.

745
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
So, I resigned.

746
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,000
Nan Nan told me she wanted me to follow my heart.

747
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,500
But I...

748
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't know what my heart wants.

749
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,700
Most people don't.

750
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
You don't know either?

751
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,800
I... I'm not sure.

752
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,200
I'm pretty stressed now.

753
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,800
But I think my husband and my child are pretty nice.

754
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,300
So, I'm pretty content.

755
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,600
It's good.

756
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
That's living in the present.

757
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
That's pretty nice.

758
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,000
I've never thought about this.

759
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Who can ever define what's good or bad?

760
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,500
Who can guarantee that their chosen path is a good one?

761
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,600
So, I just lived my life.

762
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,300
Working,

763
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,400
getting married, having a baby,

764
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,100
buying a house like others,

765
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,200
buying a car like others,

766
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,800
and following the crowd.

767
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,400
I'll always be with the majority

768
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,000
and in the safe zone.

769
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,000
Sister, this is the first time that I find you

770
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,600
so conventional yet peculiar.

771
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,700
I have no time for internal conflicts and contemplation.

772
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,200
That needs energy.

773
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,100
That's mental exhaustion, like what you're doing.

774
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,200
Mental exhaustion.

775
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,600
Yes. That's me.

776
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,400
That's really me.

777
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,400
So, just follow your heart.

778
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,200
Don't live in the past

779
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,600
or bank on the future.

780
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,800
Just don't regret your decisions.

781
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
All right.

782
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

783
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,900
Don't leave.

784
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,400
Let's continue.

785
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,921
- Chat with me.
- Okay.

786
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Speak your mind.

787
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,200
I'll listen.

788
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Let me share my thoughts on the homestay with you.

789
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,000
You've been there.

790
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,500
Urban folks, especially those born in cities,

791
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,200
have never been to places so seeped in nature.

792
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,500
It's not that rural.

793
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,700
The transportation is convenient as well.

794
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,200
People who are stressed like me

795
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,000
get to watch the sky and clouds over there

796
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,600
and just think about my meals.

797
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,200
I feel healed in body and mind.

798
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,600
It's like a buffer between life and reality.

799
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,500
A buffer.

800
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,200
What else?

801
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Xie Zhiyao also said this.

802
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,300
A good entrepreneur should be a good storyteller.

803
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,200
I think my experience is great.

804
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,500
It's a fabulous story.

805
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't know what to say to that.

806
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,400
He's led you astray.

807
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,000
That only means

808
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I have the mind of a boss.

809
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,590
You've packaged it so well,

810
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,000
but you're just doing it for a man.

811
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,800
He plays a very important part.

812
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,300
However, I want both the man and my career.

813
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,900
Excellent. Well done.

814
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,800
Seems like you've picked yourself up.

815
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
You have my support. Do your best.

816
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,200
Sister, you think...

817
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,200
it's risky to set up a homestay.

818
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,000
I don't have much money either.

819
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,500
Mom and Dad will think I'll starve again.

820
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,000
Your boyfriend can cook. You won't starve.

821
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,300
He isn't my boyfriend yet.

822
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Sister, if my relationship

823
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,200
and business fails, what should I do?

824
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,300
Live in the moment.

825
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,400
Okay.

826
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,200
Live in the moment.

827
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,400
Live in the moment.

828
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,000
You have a weapon that others don't.

829
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,600
Your sister.

830
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Let's go to bed.

831
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,900
I can't feel my legs. They're numb.

832
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,300
Be careful.

833
