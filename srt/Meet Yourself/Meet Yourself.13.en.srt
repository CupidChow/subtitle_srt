<i>[Meet yourself]</i>

2
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,140
I can't write.

4
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,560
Out of inspiration today?

5
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,460
A full-time job doesn't rely on inspiration.

6
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,280
I lost inspiration for this story ages ago.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,520
Well, how are you supposed to write without inspiration?

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,480
I have to.

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,520
But how?

10
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,300
Using sheer fortitude, persistence,

11
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,980
and the zeal of burning my life to dust.

12
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,260
Sounds very passionate.

13
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,500
It's also misery.

14
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,860
There's a quote from a movie.

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,920
"Anguish is the soil of creation."

16
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,160
I agree.

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,060
How about adopting hydroponics?

18
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,620
Sorry. I tried to make a joke to lift your spirits.

19
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,360
Well, it's funny.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,660
Right?

21
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,559
So, you should speak to us more often.

22
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,300
We can't help you with writing,

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,600
but chatting with us will improve your mood.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,340
I... I'm considering working as a teacher.

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,460
Are you planning to change your career?

26
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,210
I started writing since the last year of college.

27
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,280
After graduation, I became a full-time writer.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,909
I was still young back then.

29
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,060
At the start, I was robust and without a care.

30
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,220
I could complete 20,000 words each day.

31
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,680
My income was decent as well.

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,729
After writing for several years, I developed some tricks.

33
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,740
My writing style improved.

34
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,440
and so did my storytelling abilities.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,620
But I couldn't write as fast as before.

36
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,920
The themes I'm fond of are rather obscure,

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,100
so my works aren't popular.

38
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,179
No matter what plots I draft, I'd been criticized.

39
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,440
I felt overwhelmed and frustrated.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,800
I didn't know what to do either.

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,159
Right now, I'm considering my dad's suggestion.

42
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,160
Perhaps I'll find a regular job

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,600
after I finish this series.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,540
But you love writing novels.

45
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,260
My parents are worried sick about me as well.

46
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,579
I'm an unpopular writer writing about an obscure theme.

47
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,760
Even I'm not confident of pulling it off well.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,999
I don't know whether my future will improve.

49
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,560
Will I even make it to spring and find a flowery path?

50
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,220
Actually, I'm a tacky person.

51
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,540
I want to earn loads and be liked by others.

52
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,160
I also yearn for success.

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,119
Who doesn't? Everyone has the same desires.

54
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,980
Exactly.

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,960
You're the first writer I know.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,599
I used to think you guys didn't have to go to work.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,599
I thought you were rich and had all the time in the world.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,839
Tons of readers shower you with love, so you should be leading blissful lives.

59
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,869
Only very few successful writers achieve this.

60
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:45,119
There are many online posts about the huge annual incomes of writers

61
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,740
and the earnings we get from selling copyrights.

62
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,109
However, such data only reflect those standing in the upper fraction.

63
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,540
They're one in a million.

64
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,039
The rest of us belong in the denomination, still trying to make ends meet.

65
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,380
If you're really at your wits' end,

66
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,439
can't you tell your readers to let you go on a hiatus for a while?

67
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,740
It should be fine, right?

68
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,760
I can't. Writers like me live on serializations.

69
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,900
A few days?

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,300
A mere three days...

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,100
will lead to a huge decline in readership.

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,970
Our revenues will be halved if our ranking drops.

73
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,100
We'll lose readers in a snap.

74
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,760
Your hiatus means others will have to update doubly fast.

75
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,640
You series will become rubiish.

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,669
As long as the story is good, readers will definitely wait for you.

77
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,320
As long as you write well, readers will wait for you.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,200
This is what that sounds like.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,580
If you have ¥30 million in bank savings,

80
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,090
you'll get ¥1 million annually as profit.

81
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,860
As long as I write well...

82
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,560
This premise is a huge crevice

83
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,669
and an unbridgeable barrier for 99% of writers.

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,880
So, whenever someone asks me

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,640
about my job and my works,

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,120
I don't know how or what to say.

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,360
I never knew about all these.

88
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,139
I have some thoughts.

89
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,080
I don't know whether they'll be helpful to you.

90
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,480
I admire someone like you.

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,580
You're in a job you love and you're zealous about it.

92
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,060
Even though you say you crave money and success,

93
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,269
I still believe you'll push yourself

94
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:47,210
to complete a work that brings you great fulfillment and excitement

95
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,419
even if you aren't paid a cent. Isn't that right?

96
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,680
That's because ardor counts.

97
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,040
It's absolutely not worthless to you.

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Then again, people are fond of the strong.

99
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,040
We love those folks who are undaunted

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,960
and stick to their true selves no matter the hardships they encounter.

101
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,000
Tons of people dream have heroic ambitions,

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,060
but how many of them can really be heroes?

103
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,720
We're ordinary people.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,160
We have to weigh many realistic factors

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,100
when facing life choices.

106
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,580
These are immensely heavy.

107
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,260
Damai, don't reproach yourself excessively.

108
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,200
No matter what decision you make, I'll always cheer you on.

109
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,740
Me too.

110
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,340
She's about to cry again.

111
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,869
Eat up first. The food is getting cold.

112
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,300
It's delicious.

113
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
<i>It's delicious.</i>

114
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,730
Na Na, you don't have to wash them.

115
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,660
I'll do it tomorrow.

116
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,540
Na Na, what's wrong?

117
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm fine.

118
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,020
Why are you crying after Damai feels better?

119
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,040
I...

120
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,360
I just think... I've let her down.

121
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,780
<i>Na Na.</i>

122
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,450
<i>Hello.</i>

123
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,880
<i>Uh... Did you wash my sheets for me?</i>

124
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,099
<i>You left them in the laundry basket, so I washed them with my laundry.</i>

125
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,169
<i>Thank you.</i>

126
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,019
<i>I intended to wash them, but someone was using the washing machine.</i>

127
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,949
<i>So, I decided to wash them later and left them there.</i>

128
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,300
<i>Sorry for troubling you.</i>

129
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,109
<i>It's fine. The washing machine does the heavy lifting anyway.</i>

130
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,760
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

131
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,260
<i>Let me hang them up.</i>

132
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,189
<i> - Thank you.
- Hold that end.</i>

133
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,740
<i>Okay.</i>

134
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,960
<i>Come on.</i>

135
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
<i>By the way, Damai, what's your job?</i>

136
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,650
<i>I'm a freelancer.</i>

137
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,020
<i>A freelancer?</i>

138
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,700
<i>A designer?</i>

139
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,520
<i>You're mostly cooped up in your room.</i>

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,760
<i>Are you an online streamer?</i>

141
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,020
<i>Nah.</i>

142
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,820
<i>I write novels.</i>

143
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,800
<i>A web novelist?</i>

144
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,760
<i>Keep it secret.</i>

145
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,639
<i>Don't be so modest! That's impressive!</i>

146
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,199
<i>As a child, writing compositions has been the bane of my life.</i>

147
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,239
<i>I always use punctuation and filler words</i>

148
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,440
<i>to hit the 800-word requirement.</i>

149
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,930
<i>I'm the exact opposite.</i>

150
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,379
<i>I need to restrain myself from writing too much.</i>

151
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,910
<i>Which website are your novels on?</i>

152
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,180
<i>I want to read your works.</i>

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,719
<i>What genres do you like?</i>

154
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,549
<i>I can recommend some novels for you.</i>

155
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,160
<i>You don't have to read mine.</i>

156
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,680
<i>Many fellow novelists write sweet romance novels.</i>

157
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,569
<i>I'm not particular, but I prefer martial arts and mystery novels.</i>

158
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,720
<i>More importantly, I want to read your works.</i>

159
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,460
<i>After all, it's rare to be sharing residences with a writer.</i>

160
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,100
<i>Do you think I'm a loser?</i>

161
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
<i>No way.</i>

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
<i>You can read them.</i>

163
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,800
<i>Well, which website are your works on?</i>

164
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
<i>I don't have an account, so I have to register for one.</i>

165
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,300
<i>You don't have to.</i>

166
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
<i>I'll send you a file. You can read it on your phone.</i>

167
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,200
<i>That won't do.</i>

168
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,700
<i>I have to pay for it.</i>

169
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,200
<i>It's fine.</i>

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
<i>You can read it by yourself.</i>

171
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,500
<i>Just don't send it to others.</i>

172
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
<i>But I can't read for free.</i>

173
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,400
<i>You aren't.</i>

174
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
<i>You washed my sheets.</i>

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
<i>The washing machine washed them. That doesn't count.</i>

176
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
<i>It certainly does.</i>

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
<i>Let's go.</i>

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
<i>What do you want for lunch? Let's eat together.</i>

179
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>I'm fine with anything. Are you off duty today?</i>

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>I have one day off every week.</i>

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
<i>Well, what do you want to eat?</i>

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
<i>I'm not picky. You can choose.</i>

183
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>I... Shall I cook for you?</i>

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
<i>Can you cook?</i>

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
<i>God of Earth! Where is my magical staff Jingu Bang?</i>

186
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,800
<i>Monkey King! Your Jingu Bang complements your hairstyle perfectly!</i>

187
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>Little Sister! Warm yourself by the fire.</i>

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>She's Damai.</i>

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
- <i>Call her Damai.</i>
- <i>Fine, Damai.</i>

190
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
<i>Little Sister Mai Mai, come and warm yourself up.</i>

191
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
<i>Damai, are you hungry?</i>

192
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>We have baked sweet potatoes and corn.</i>

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,800
<i>Have a seat! I'll introduce our neighbors to you.</i>

194
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
<i>Come on.</i>

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,600
<i>This is Ma Qiushan, Mr. Ma.</i>

196
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
<i>Hello.</i>

197
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>The one eating corn is Hu Youyu, Mr. Hu.</i>

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,300
<i>He's a singer.</i>

199
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
<i>I'm a musician.</i>

200
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>Fine, a musician.</i>

201
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,900
<i>Little Sister Damai, what's your job?</i>

202
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>You're a singer. She's a web novelist.</i>

203
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,300
<i>A web novelist!</i>

204
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,700
<i>That's a lucrative job.</i>

205
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,600
<i>An online post I read said that web novelists earn ¥100 million annually.</i>

206
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
<i>Now I get it.</i>

207
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,500
<i>That's why you always stay indoors.</i>

208
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>Your light is even on late at night.</i>

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,300
<i>So, you're into literary creation.</i>

210
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,500
<i>I get it.</i>

211
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
<i>A homebody and a night owl.</i>

212
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,300
<i>Everything clicks now.</i>

213
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>You write books while I write songs.</i>

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,600
<i>Essentially, we're peers with a common language.</i>

215
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,300
<i>Let's chat more often in the future.</i>

216
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
<i>Why aren't you speaking?</i>

217
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,400
<i>Is she just taciturn?</i>

218
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
<i>You're too talkative.</i>

219
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
<i>Got it.</i>

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,700
<i>Social phobia is the new trend, isn't it?</i>

221
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,400
<i>It's all a farce.</i>

222
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,300
<i>Little Sister Damai, what's your pen name?</i>

223
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,200
<i>I want to read your works carefully</i>

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,300
<i>and appreciate them.</i>

225
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,900
<i>Sorry. I want to keep my sockpuppet on.</i>

226
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
<i>Enjoy yourselves.</i>

227
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,800
<i>Are you craving something else?</i>

228
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
<i>Nope, the corn is enough.</i>

229
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,700
<i>I want to make myself some noodles.</i>

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,600
<i>Um... What's going on?</i>

231
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,700
<i>What's with the sockpuppet?</i>

232
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,200
<i>Why is she so secretive?</i>

233
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,900
<i>That's her privacy.</i>

234
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,100
<i>A stranger like you shouldn't pry.</i>

235
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
<i>Why keep it a secret?</i>

236
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>Aren't we helping her with promoting her works?</i>

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,700
<i>Na Na, do you know her pen name?</i>

238
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,400
<i>I don't know.</i>

239
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,700
<i>Do you know what a sockpuppet is?</i>

240
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
<i>Nope.</i>

241
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,000
Damai really intended to keep this a secret with me.

242
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,200
She must've placed great trust in me back then.

243
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
That's why she told me.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
I didn't know she was struggling so much.

245
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
I fancied myself clever

246
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,800
an assumed keeping her pen name a secret was enough.

247
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,000
She doesn't blame you.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
That's why I feel so horrible.

249
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,100
Even if you're best friends, you can't read her mind.

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
Just treat her better in the future.

251
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>Good morning, Damai.</i>

252
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,400
<i>What's going on? Are you still sleepy?</i>

253
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
<i>Don't worry.</i>

254
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
<i>It's fine for them to know you're a writer.</i>

255
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,700
<i>They don't know your pen name. Right?</i>

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
<i>Thank you.</i>

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
<i>Thank you?</i>

258
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,200
<i>Why are you thanking me?</i>

259
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,300
<i>You know? I cried when I read Chapter 30.</i>

260
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,100
<i>Why?</i>

261
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,400
<i>The heroine thought she'd die there,</i>

262
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
<i>so she swallowed the evidence.</i>

263
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,000
<i>She hoped it could be found during the autopsy.</i>

264
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
<i>Even though I knew there were low chances of her death,</i>

265
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>I still cried because it was too moving.</i>

266
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
<i>That part got the most criticism.</i>

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,700
<i>Why?</i>

268
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,200
<i>Some readers think she's reckless,</i>

269
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
<i>while others think the hero is useless.</i>

270
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,500
<i>I think this story has too little romance,</i>

271
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,200
<i>but the crime-solving is so intriguing.</i>

272
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,600
<i>Why does the heroine need to wait for the hero to save her?</i>

273
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,800
<i>It's impressive that she chooses to save herself.</i>

274
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
<i>Besides, as the heroine's colleague,</i>

275
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,600
<i>the hero has done everything he can.</i>

276
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
<i>I think everyone has their own preferences.</i>

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,900
<i>There'll always be supporters and haters.</i>

278
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,000
<i>Anyway, I love this.</i>

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,300
<i>There are my true thoughts.</i>

280
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,000
<i>I'm not just flattering you.</i>

281
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,000
<i>Thank you for your appreciation and support.</i>

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
<i>Why are you thanking me again?</i>

283
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,000
<i>I should thank you.</i>

284
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>You've never asked me to pay.</i>

285
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
<i>Damai.</i>

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>You seem to really love cats.</i>

287
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,300
<i>So, I want to</i>

288
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
<i>give this kitten to you.</i>

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,500
<i>It can accompany you when you're writing at night.</i>

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
<i>It's so cute!</i>

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
<i>Do you like it?</i>

292
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
<i>Yes! Thank you!</i>

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
<i>Stop thanking me.</i>

294
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,200
<i>How many chapters have you finished?</i>

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,500
<i>Over 80 chapters.</i>

296
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,900
<i>You have to push on.</i>

297
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>To be honest, I'm almost done with reading everything.</i>

298
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800

Ask your friend who owns the clothing store

when they'll consider dispatching orders to a small clothing factory.

Yes, factories with less than five people.

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Got it. I'll wait for your call.

When the foal grows up, you can ride it.

321
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,200
I will have left by then.

322
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,700
So, are you returning to Beijing?

323
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
Maybe Shanghai.

324
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,100
That's true. Your sister is in Shanghai.

325
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,200
She can take care of you.

326
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,300
Don't you think time flies?

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
Yes, it does.

328
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,900
Have you accumulated enough energy to start over?

329
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Let me have a sense of it.

330
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,300
Not yet.

331
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
It'll be soon.

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Have you already let go of the things weighing down your heart?

333
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,800
I wanted to,

334
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,100
but I'm starting to cling on to them.

335
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Neither can I do so.

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,100
Everything we cherish has weight.

337
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,600
We need to adapt to living with this baggage.

338
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,400
In life, hardships and sufferings are inevitable.

339
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
Only then can we grow.

340
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
Fortunately,

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,800
these miseries vanish quickly.

342
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Time will wash away all things

343
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
and heal all wounds.

344
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Time is the most brutal

345
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,500
and the kindest as well.

346
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
That's very true.

347
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,400
It's almost been a year.

348
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Modern life is fast-paced.

349
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,200
Actually, a year is a long time.

350
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,400
It feels like only yesterday.

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,700
Are you that deeply in love with him?

352
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,600
What are you talking about?

353
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,800
I...

354
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Haven't I told you before?

355
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm perceptive.

356
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
Didn't you break up with your lover?

357
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Look.

358
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,400
You're gorgeous and a capable worker.

359
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,800
How can you be so clingy in romance?

360
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,300
You even resigned.

361
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Is he your colleague?

362
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,400
Why didn't he resign?

363
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Why are you staring at me?

364
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Am I wrong?

365
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,100
No, you're absolutely right.

366
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,600
That person was the dearest person to me.

367
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,800
If so, you have to listen to my advice.

368
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,500
I refuse.

369
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm heading back.

370
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Wait. Where are you going?

371
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
Back to the cafe.

372
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Don't flee from your problems!

373
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
You've regained the power to start over, haven't you?

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
Xu Hongdou!

375
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,300
♫ <i>There are stars in my journey</i> ♫

376
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,600
Come over for dinner tonight!

377
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,500
♫ <i>There are rainbows</i> ♫

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,400
♫ <i>We lose the chance to hug</i> ♫

379
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,300
Braised chicken!

380
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,400
♫ <i>A breeze wafts through some parts of the world</i> ♫

381
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,900
♫ <i>Hidden spots make my heart flutter</i> ♫

382
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Braised chicken?

383
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What about braised red beans?
("Hongdou" means red beans)

384
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,700
♫ <i>In the street where rain and sunshine shower down</i> ♫

385
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I told you to cut them into shreds. Why are these in chunks?

386
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,500
I like onion chunks.

387
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,400
Why not just eat it whole?

388
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,200
My eyes. Spare my eyes!

389
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,700
Chairman Xie!

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,100
- Hongdou, you're here too.
- You're here.

391
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,400
Mr. Ma, you came just in time.

392
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
Want to join us for braised chicken?

393
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
No, thanks.

394
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
I have a teleconference later.

395
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
Chairman Xie.

396
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,400
How is it? Any good news?

397
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,700
I found you some funds.

398
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Really?

399
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,900
I called my former colleague, Shen Liang.

400
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,200
You've met him before.

401
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
I told him about your business idea.

402
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
He's willing to offer you seed capital.

403
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
Draft a proposal, and I'll link you guys up.

404
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I won't interfere after that.

405
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
That's fine.

406
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
Goodness...

407
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,700
Old Xie.

408
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Listen to me.

409
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
From now on, we're blood brothers.

410
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,600
No, thanks. It's not a lot of money.

411
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
We can just be cousins.

412
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,100
No, we have to be family.

413
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,300
My gosh! You're always swooping in to help at the crucial moment.

414
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Fine, I'll leave you to your task.

415
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,800
I have to prepare for the meeting.

416
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
One more hug! My dear brother.

417
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
All right. My good man!

418
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Enjoy your chicken!

419
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
What is it?

420
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,500
Is he going to set up a business?

421
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,800
Is he such a hustler?

422
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
He's more than that.

423
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,900
He's a real daredevil.

424
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,100
A daredevil?

425
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
We've known each other for years because of work.

426
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,400
He's an old acquaintance.

427
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,900
<i>Over 20 collective buying websites were set up just this month.</i>

428
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,800
<i>It's a pretty fierce competition.</i>

429
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
<i>Why is it so?</i>

430
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,000
<i>That's because it's a promising market!</i>

431
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>I'm not afraid of competition.</i>

432
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,600
<i>We're vying for the throne!</i>

433
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,800
<i>The champion hasn't been decided yet.</i>

434
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,500
<i>Buddy!</i>

435
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,000
<i>I want to unleash a surprise attack so they won't be able to react.</i>

436
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,300
<i>If their minimum is 20 a group, I'll only require 10 people.</i>

437
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>If they only need 10 people, I'll lower mine to 5.</i>

438
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
<i>If they drop to just 5 people, I'll make do with just 1 person a group!</i>

439
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,000
<i>How will you negotiate prices with firms?</i>

440
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,600
<i>I won't. Negotiations aren't necessary.</i>

441
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,600
<i>We'll pay for the price difference ourselves.</i>

442
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,600
<i>That's why I need as many funds as possible.</i>

443
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
<i>Pay for it ourselves?</i>

444
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
<i>Yes.</i>

445
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,300
<i>Buddy.</i>

446
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
<i>Eagles don't catch flies.</i>

447
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,500
<i>We must have foresight.</i>

448
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,800
<i>Don't focus on the pennies before us.</i>

449
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>Broaden your sights.</i>

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,500
<i>We...</i>

451
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,479
<i>will think over it.</i>

452
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,700
<i>Think...</i>

453
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,700
<i>Fine.</i>

454
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
<i>Success will be ours.</i>

455
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>Group purchases?</i>

456
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
<i>That was an idea from centuries ago.</i>

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,300
<i>I've cashed out on that.</i>

458
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>Buddy,</i>

459
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,800
<i>do you know what the most promising market is now?</i>

460
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,200
<i>Paying for wisdom.</i>

461
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,100
<i>How can consumption be upgraded?</i>

462
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,800
<i>Through knowledge. The improvement of immaterial wealth.</i>

463
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,400
<i>Of course, I won't be like...</i>

464
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,500
<i>those fearmongers.</i>

465
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,000
<i>I want to evoke an innate desire</i>

466
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
<i>in our citizens for knowledge</i>

467
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
<i>and a longing for self-improvement.</i>

468
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,400
<i>I know what questions are on your mind.</i>

469
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,200
<i>Who's paying for this?</i>

470
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,300
<i>Data traffic is everything.</i>

471
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,500
<i>The advertisers will pay,</i>

472
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,700
<i>and I'll energize knowledge building.</i>

473
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
<i>The advertizers will pay the bill for knowledge.</i>

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
<i>What a noble venture!</i>

475
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,400
<i>Even I'm filled with admiration for myself.</i>

476
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
<i>Want one?</i>

477
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,500
<i>I don't smoke.</i>

478
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

479
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,000
<i>Smoking is prohibited here.</i>

480
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,600
<i>Lass, let me teach you something for free.</i>

481
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,000
<i>This is a cigar.</i>

482
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,900
<i>No cigars either.</i>

483
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,100
<i>Fine.</i>

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,500
<i>I can smell it, right?</i>

485
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,900
<i>A sharing economy.</i>

486
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,000
<i>It is definitely a noble and pioneering move.</i>

487
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,300
<i>Marvelous.</i>

488
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,000
<i>The Red Sea Market right now</i>

489
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,600
<i>can only solve surface problems.</i>

490
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,300
<i>We need to dig into the roots of problems.</i>

491
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>What's the rarest things in the world?</i>

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
<i>Resources.</i>

493
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,000
<i>That's why everything should be shared,</i>

494
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
<i>and these shared resources have to be maximized.</i>

495
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
<i>Consider this.</i>

496
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,900
<i>Any aspect of our daily lives...</i>

497
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
<i>has tons of possibilities for development.</i>

498
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,000
<i>There is boundless potential.</i>

499
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,000
<i>Besides, a sharing economy</i>

500
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
<i>doesn't just benefit the economy.</i>

501
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,600
<i>Our nation, our citizens, and the world will benefit!</i>

502
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
<i>This is an upstanding act of kindness!</i>

503
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,500
<i>Since we're good friends,</i>

504
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,600
<i>I'm sharing this act of kindness with you.</i>

505
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,900
<i>I'll leave the first round of angel investments to you.</i>

506
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,000
<i>You wouldn't be able to get this price</i>

507
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,700
<i>in the subsequent rounds.</i>

508
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,400
<i>When my firm is on the market,</i>

509
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,300
<i>you'll only be able to make purchases</i>

510
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>from the secondary market even if we're best buddies.</i>

511
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,100
<i>I see.</i>

512
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>I'll have a meeting about this once I'm back.</i>

513
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,600
<i>Okay.</i>

514
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,600
<i>But make it quick.</i>

515
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,900
<i>Chances wait for no one.</i>

516
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,000
<i>Aren't I right, Sharey?</i>

517
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
<i>At that time,</i>

518
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,300
<i>I'll let you tag along when we ring the bell.</i>

519
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,600
He was in luck the first few times,

520
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
and he could cash out before crisis struck.

521
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,700
He earned some money and could even compound his money.

522
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,500
In his final attempt with the sharing economy,

523
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,700
he thought he finally found

524
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,600
a career he could devote his life to.

525
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,300
He invested all his money.

526
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
It ended in failure.

527
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,700
After a blow in his career,

528
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
did his temperament change drastically?

529
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,200
Did he switch from pursing success to seeking enlightenment?

530
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,600
Enlightenment?

531
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
His mental state merely collapsed.

532
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>Is anyone in?</i>

533
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,400
That's Xiao Qin's dad.

534
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,100
Second Brother!

535
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,900
<i>A'Yao, you're in.</i>

536
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,320
My sundry store has been around for over a decade.

537
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,380
There were barely any shops in town back then.

538
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,940
Look at the place now.

539
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,509
We have a supermarket and that 24-hours convenience store in the works.

540
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,140
Besides, the young and old shop online.

541
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,660
It's hard to run a sundry store.

542
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,560
You're right. You've made thorough considerations.

543
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,420
I'm a man with foresight.

544
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:10,840
Embroidery is a good skill and it's also promising.

545
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,700
I agree. It's an intangible cultural heritage that needs protection and succession.

546
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,829
That's why she has to learn it and master it!

547
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,500
She's more pliant to you. Persuade her.

548
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,860
Second Brother, you can't force her on this.

549
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,819
I think Xiao Qin really isn't interested in embroidery.

550
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,060
Nah. Tell her this.

551
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,400
Say that you'll ask for her hand in marriage

552
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,720
once she masters it.

553
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,989
Let's just coax her to learn it first. Don't you agree?

554
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,390
A'Yao.

555
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,100
<i>Granny!</i>

556
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,399
A'Yao, here's your braised chicken.

557
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,560
Hi, Honghong.

558
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,140
Second Brother, you're here too!

559
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,009
A'Yao, if you have a guest, we can talk to you when we're collecting the plate.

560
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:05,379
Don't worry. You came just in time. We just finished our discussion.

561
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,820
My friends are waiting for me to play Mahjong with them.

562
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,480
Well...

563
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,700
Granny, I'll get going.

564
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,249
- Take care!
- Take care.

565
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:23,980
I won't see you off.

566
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,800
That's fine.

567
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,379
Bye-bye.

568
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,740
Have a seat.

569
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,840
Honghong, you told me you want to set up a small clothing factory.

570
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,350
I gathered some resources based on the data you offered.

571
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,190
I've also drafted the budget.

572
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,329
Your expected cost is still a little too low.

573
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:46,449
You can't just consider the cost of making a piece of clothing.

574
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,359
You have to include the rental, the utility bills,

575
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,779
machine purchases and repair, materials costs, and reworking costs.

576
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:54,860
Have a look.

577
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,980
I also made inquries.

578
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,640
Orders for small factories may not be consistent.

579
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,970
It might be rush orders or no orders at all.

580
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,040
You have to be prepared and think through this.

581
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
He's really busy every day.

582
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,700
Everyone comes to him when they have problems.

583
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,620
They think he's educated and knowledgeable.

584
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,979
We're fellow villagers, so he tries his best to help.

585
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,679
<i>[Dou: It's the same for me. My relatives ask me to get room reservations for them when they visit Beijing and ask for travel recommendations.]</i>

586
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,019
<i>[A'Yao: Xiao Qin's dad wants me to deceive her feelings. That's a tall order...]
[Life has me by the neck]</i>

587
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,620
<i>[Dou: You're the village beau. Good looks come with great responsibility.]</i>

588
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:42,200
♫ <i>Could navigate through the dark</i> ♫

589
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,300
♫ <i>I'm searching for a meadow of mine</i> ♫

590
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,160
<i>[A'Yao: Shall we have rice noodles tomorrow?]</i>

591
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,260
♫ <i>Till you came in with the breeze</i> ♫

592
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,950
<i>[Dou: What time are we going?]</i>

593
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,240
♫ <i>A feeling rushes over me</i> ♫

594
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,100
<i>[A'Yao: Half past five.]</i>

595
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,020
<i>[Dou: Get out.]</i>

596
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,960
♫ <i>I know it, I will be yours</i> ♫

597
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,220
♫ <i>And smile</i> ♫

598
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,289
They said A'Yao's ex-lover came over from Beijing just for him.

599
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:19,659
She's living in the courtyard now.

600
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:20,860
Have you seen her?

601
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,980
His ex?

602
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,020
Don't you know?

603
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,860
She's living there and refusing to leave.

604
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,609
She's determined on salvaging their relationship.

605
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,680
I saw them at the riverside.

606
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,519
The riverside? What were they doing?

607
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,420
What else can they be doing so intimately?

608
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,840
You know.

609
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,940
They kissed?

610
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,899
I was too embarrassed to look closely.

611
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,939
Sister, tell me more.

612
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,379
Don't you know? Word has spread throughout our village.

613
00:37:51,379 --> 00:37:55,280
Exactly. Someone saw them at the riverside...

614
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,960
Oh my goodness!

615
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,429
They should do that behind closed doors!

616
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:01,839
Why are they doing it in public?

617
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,499
Can't they spare a thought for everyone else?

618
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:05,160
Oh, I recall.

619
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,289
On Hongdou's first day here, I brought beef over to A'Yao's home.

620
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,080
She was dining at his home.

621
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,229
I thought that was strange.

622
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,739
Why would a tenant at the courtyard eat at his house?

623
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:16,760
Exactly.

624
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,200
So, she's clearly here for him.

625
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,080
I figured this out ages ago.

626
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,609
She ate barbecue with A'Yao at Guanjun's store.

627
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,200
They were exchanging amorous glances.

628
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,779
She noticed it ages ago?

629
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:30,409
Why didn't you tell us a word?

630
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,899
I asked Guanjun whether they were a couple.

631
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:37,120
Guanjun denied it, so I didn't dare spread rumors.

632
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,699
Everything clicks now.

633
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:41,659
Think about it. Past volunteers only helped with chores.

634
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,129
Hongdou is different.

635
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:46,280
She made an employee manual and helped to manage the cafe.

636
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,739
She's doing some heavy lifting for free.

637
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,149
That's pretty telling.

638
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,299
Exactly. What's telling?

639
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,880
- You...
- She's the lady boss!

640
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,609
A lady boss is the boss's wife.

641
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:02,600
So, Sister Hongdou is Uncle A'Yao's wife.

642
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,819
They aren't married, so she isn't his wife.

643
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:08,479
She can only be an unmarried wife.

644
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:13,400
When they get married, we can have pork stew!

645
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,459
I heard they had been dating in Beijing for several years.

646
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:23,059
A'Yao decided to work here and broke up with her.

647
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:26,309
The grannies in the village introduced several girls to him, but he didn't take a second glance at a single one.

648
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:28,320
It's because he couldn't forget about this girl.

649
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,050
She can't move on from him either.

650
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,080
That's why she came looking for him.

651
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,449
I wonder if my pigs will mature in time for a wedding.

652
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,979
It'll be soon. I've seen them.

653
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,599
They even went to Ms. Huailan's home to order their wedding attire.

654
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,860
Your pigs will make it in time.

655
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,589
- That's great.
- Wonderful.

656
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,680
Granny Xie! Congratulations!

657
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,820
I'm looking forward to A'Yaos wedding.

658
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,740
I'll get going.

659
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,019
In short, the rumor has inflated ridiculously.

660
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:12,580
You've become Chairman Xie's infatuated fiancee.

661
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,320
If both of you don't get married, I don't know how this will end.

662
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,519
Sister Hongdou, this is for you.

663
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,980
For me?

664
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,300
Pretty nice work.

665
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,780
Why the gift?

666
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,999
I'm poor, and this is my only skill.

667
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,489
It's a Childbirth Guanyin. She's carrying two kids.

668
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,860
You'll have twins if you have this in your home.

669
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,900
Stop adding oil to the fire.

670
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,080
What fire?

671
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,020
Is this really for me?

672
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,540
Don't regret it.

673
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,570
I won't.

674
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,500
My skills are shabby, so don't be disdainful of it.

675
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,380
I won't.

676
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,940
I like it.

677
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,880
- I'll head off.
- Okay.

678
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,059
Bye-bye.

679
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,400
Why did you accept it?

680
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,880
It's Xia Xia's well wishes.

681
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,220
Besides, it can bring twins.

682
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,780
Well, how are you going to end this?

683
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,180
End this?

684
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,279
I won't. It's none of my business.

685
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,200
It's none of my business.

686
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,580
What are you looking at?

687
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,020
We're looking at the bride.

688
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,540
Bride?

689
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,379
Yeah.

690
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,570
Where's the bride?

691
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,799
She's over there. That's Uncle A'Yao's future bride.

692
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,660
Exactly.

693
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,940
- She's so different.
- Yeah!

694
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,700
Who was asking questions earlier?

695
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,160
No clue.

696
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,460
