00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,900
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

3
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,700
If you don't want to attend school,

4
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,040
are you really planning to rear horses here?

5
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,279
I've made up my mind.

6
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,640
When I come of age next year,

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,900
I'll ask Aunty Baoping to set up a blind date for me.

8
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,620
After that, I'll date her for a few years.

9
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,419
When I reach a marriageable age, I'll marry her.

10
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,940
Like this, Granny can have a great-grandson soon.

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,359
What happens after the child is born?

12
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,740
Do you want the child to rear horses with you?

13
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,860
After the child is born, they'll be sent to Kunming for Dad to raise them.

14
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,320
They'll keep him occupied.

15
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm killing two birds with one stone.

16
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,880
Dying to kick me, aren't you? Bring it on.

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,380
Do you want to kick me? Come on.

18
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,799
Kick me. Here.

19
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,260
Kick me hard. Kick me.

20
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm not going to school. I want freedom.

21
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,240
Kick me! Kick me!

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,420
Kick me!

23
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,360
Come on!

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,300
- A'Yuan.
- I'm not going to school.

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,220
- I want freedom.
- A'Yuan.

26
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,380
Did you anger your brother again?

27
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,840
- Xia Xia, you're here.
- Granny.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
We're waiting for you to have dinner.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
I brought ham over for you.

30
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,780
This is really good ham.

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,119
Come here tomorrow.

32
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,519
I'll cook it for you.

33
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,100
Thank you, Granny.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,240
What's wrong, A'Yuan?

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,660
He wants to chase me back to Kunming.

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,200
Brother, are you chasing him out again?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,320
He doesn't like studying. If you force him to study, he'll feel miserable.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,739
It's also a waste of your money.

39
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,160
Exactly.

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
Shut up.

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's leave A'Yuan's matter aside for now.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,100
Xia Xia, I invited you over for dinner today

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,000
to ask about your friend in Shanghai.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,880
Did my mom come to you again?

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,639
Don't resent your mom.

46
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,580
She's worried about you.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,679
My sister went to university.

48
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,140
So, my mom thinks that she's right about everything.

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,420
I only graduated from junior high school.

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,840
Whenever my sister says I'm wrong,

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,900
my mom also thinks I'm wrong.

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, tell me the truth.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,860
Why do you want to go to Shanghai?

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,060
Just to travel.

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,900
All my life, the farthest place I've been to is Kunming.

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,260
I can't even remember a thing because I was too young.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,560
Just to travel? Aren't you going to look for a job?

58
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll go and take a look first.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Are you going to look for a job or not?

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,220
You've studied wood carving for so long.

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,940
When Uncle was drunk a while back,

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,820
he said your skills were improving.

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,200
It's not easy to master a skill.

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,520
Are you going to give up so easily?

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm not.

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,919
Brother Kaiwen told me... He's my friend in Shanghai.

67
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,100
He knows someone in Shanghai who's the owner of a wood carving studio.

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,920
He can recommend me for an interview.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
They'll assess my skills.

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,560
He knows the owner of a wood carving studio?

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,260
Well, what's his job?

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,580
He runs a homestay.

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,480
He recently went on a business trip to Tonglu.

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,200
He said that once he was back from his business trip, he'll invite me over to Shanghai and stay in his house.

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,780
This is him. The one in the middle.

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,540
He looks about your age.

77
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,640
He's two years older than me and much more accomplished than me.

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,520
How did you get to know each other?

79
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,900
I was live streaming while working.

80
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,319
Not many people were watching me. He's the only one who gave me a reward.

81
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,640
My master caught me after that. He said I wasn't focusing on my work, so I stopped streaming.

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,620
Brother, stop treating me like a child.

83
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm 22.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
I just want to broaden my horizons.

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,840
What do you plan to tell your master?

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,080
I'll say it's a short trip.

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,940
As for the job, they might not necessarily hire me.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
My master has been really irritable lately.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,080
Don't make excuses.

90
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,420
If you're truly keen on looking for a job elsewhere,

91
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,400
you should be honest with Uncle.

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,260
This is the respect he deserves.

93
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,920
Besides, the wood carving workshop can always hire others.

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,420
Okay, I get it.

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,240
As for your mom,

96
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,160
I'll talk to her.

97
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,660
Eat up.

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,460
Thank you, Brother.

99
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,440
Yes! That's great, Brother Xia Xia! Don't forget a souvenir for me!

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
No problem.

101
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,880
Eat up.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Granny, what are you doing? Come and have dinner.

103
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,399
I'm frying some milk cakes.

104
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,200
Stop frying them, Granny. We have enough food.

105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,240
Granny, come over for dinner! Granny!

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,820
<i>I'll be done in a jiffy.</i>

107
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,560
You two can eat first. I'll help her.

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,160
Okay.

109
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,620
Brother, this is delicious. Try it.

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,320
<i>Granny! Let me do it.</i>

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,040
Did he kick you?

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,080
He doesn't have the guts to kick me.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
A'Yao.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,760
All right. I got it.

115
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,540
Is he back now?

116
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,680
He probably hasn't arrived yet.

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,159
Okay, I got it.

118
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,340
Rest early.

119
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,100
All right.

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,760
Is that you, Xia Xia?

121
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,280
Sit down.

122
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,840
Well... A'Yao told me on the phone.

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,820
He said to let you go.

124
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,759
Since your brother already spoke up,

125
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,820
I won't stop you.

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,660
Are you still angry?

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm not angry.

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm just worried.

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
In my whole life,

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,020
I've never been to the provincial capital, even more so Shanghai.

131
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,000
You're heading so far away this time.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,440
You have to take a plane and a train.

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,940
I'm just worried.

134
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,200
A'Yao also told me that you're an adult now.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,300
He asked me to stop treating you like a child.

136
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,090
Since you have your own plans and want to make a name in the city,

137
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,840
I should let you go.

138
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,720
I just feel sorry for your master.

139
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,560
He's been guiding your for six years.

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
You're so close to becoming independent, but you're leaving.

141
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,760
If I meet him in the villlage, I'll feel bad.

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,580
Don't worry about our family.

143
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,100
You don't have to think about sending money home either.

144
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm working in the warehouse.

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
That salary is enough.

146
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,680
But being out there can't beat being at home.

147
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,900
You have hot meals waiting for you at home.

148
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,760
When you're away, you have to be independent.

149
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,920
I heard people say that

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,240
not everyone can be trusted.

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,300
You don't think much either.

152
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm afraid others will bully you...

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,660
or you'll be led astray.

154
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,680
Aunty Feng's son, Xie Qiang,

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,319
was such a good boy.

156
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,899
He left home and was led astray by hooligans.

157
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,300
He ended up in jail.

158
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,760
Let's not talk about this. Pour out this water for me.

159
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,280
Don't dispose of it. Pour it into the bucket.

160
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,620
I'll flush the toilet with it.

161
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,160
Mom.

162
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,800
I'll earn tons of money in the future

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,380
and buy you a big house in the city.

164
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,700
It'll be near the hospital and surrounded by facilities.

165
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,540
Just wait for me.

166
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,100
I'm not used to living there.

167
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,500
Live with your wife there.

168
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,359
The Xie family is filled with talents.

169
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,940
A'Yuan isn't the only one.

170
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,560
You even have Xia Xia.

171
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,699
Xia Xia is unlike A'Yuan.

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,040
Xia Xia has always been a sensible child.

173
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,919
His dad passed away early.

174
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,000
Aunty Baoping brought up her two children all by herself.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,040
Xiaochun is slightly older,

176
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,980
so she helped her family wash clothes and cook.

177
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,200
Xia Xia was only eight or nine years old.

178
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,100
He tagged along with a bunch of older men to collect mushrooms in the mountains for sale.

179
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,260
A cerebral hemorrhage used to be a hopeless situation.

180
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,040
Uncle Zeqing was sent to the city hospital on a tractor.

181
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,080
It took a long time to get there.

182
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,320
If the hospital was closer,

183
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
he might've been saved.

184
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,720
Your dad's intention was to send A'Yuan home to rear horses.

185
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,979
He can suffer a bit and know that life isn't a bed of roses.

186
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:50,240
He'll happily head back and attend school.

187
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,740
Look at this fabulous result.

188
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,220
He's hooked on rearing horses.

189
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,960
My head is throbbing.

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,380
He wants to quit just because of a minor obstacle.

191
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,960
What's the matter?

192
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,920
Isn't he just bad at studying?

193
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,560
Yes, his brain doesn't retain anything.

194
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,580
Guobao, you've played for ten minutes. That's it for you.

195
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,199
Let me play for a while more! Let me play for a while more!

196
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,100
You're too young to be playing video games.

197
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,320
Stop with the games. You'll ruin your eyes.

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,100
Can you even write your own name?

199
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,640
- Idiot.
- Daddy!

200
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,759
Hit her. All he does is play.

201
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,000
You, too.

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,020
Guobao isn't even five years old, but he's already wearing glasses.

203
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,600
Don't you care?

204
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,740
He's only quiet when he's playing with the phone.

205
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,980
Is that so? Let me see your little glasses.

206
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,340
You're lovely with glasses. Aren't you?

207
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,540
Cute, right?

208
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,120
You should get married and have a child.

209
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,680
A child is fun to have around.

210
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
Is that so?

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,079
Guobao, say Daddy.

212
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,820
Daddy.

213
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,640
Kiss your daddy.

214
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,240
If your sister-in-law hears you, she'll kick you to death.

215
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,600
Guobao, don't play with the phone.

216
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,280
How about playing a game with me?

217
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
Why are you up?

218
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,820
Can't sleep?

219
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,140
I slept too much in the afternoon.

220
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,280
Why aren't you asleep, too?

221
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,560
Do you want to have some?

222
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,820
I'm not hungry, thanks.

223
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,239
You'll be hungry in no time. I have experience.

224
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,519
I'll get the utensils.

225
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,380
Let's eat together.

226
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,340
- Is that enough chili?
- Add more.

227
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,440
Hongdou, do you want chili?

228
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,140
Just a little.

229
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,540
Thank you.

230
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,499
Damai, your noodles are delicious.

231
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,740
They're good enough to be sold.

232
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,639
This doesn't require much skill.

233
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,340
I just throw whatever ingredients are available into the pot and boil them together.

234
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,480
With the same ingredients, some people can cook well while others can't.

235
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm the one who can't cook well.

236
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,000
Damai's cooking is delicious, but she doesn't wash the dishes.

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,920
I can't cook, but I can do the dishes.

238
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,660
So, whenever I want supper, I just look for her.

239
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,640
Meal buddies.

240
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,499
Hongdou, how about your cooking?

241
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:28,680
It's not very good.

242
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm busy with work, so I don't really cook.

243
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,300
The kitchen in my apartment is small and smelly.

244
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,240
What do you do for a living?

245
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,300
I used to work at a hotel's front office.

246
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,160
- Front office?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,520
I was... a Lobby Manager.

248
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,880
I was in charge of catering, rooms, and the executive lounge.

249
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,680
I coordinate between departments to provide better service for guests.

250
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,820
Awesome.

251
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,740
What's awesome about that?

252
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,960
I got promoted by virtue of seniority.

253
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,060
After all, look at my age.

254
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,999
Very... Very impressive.

255
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:08,140
After I graduated from college, I'd never worked in an office.

256
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,720
A freelancer?

257
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,600
What do you do?

258
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,400
Damai is a web novelist.

259
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,640
She used to work at home.

260
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,340
A novelist?

261
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,580
It's my first time meeting a writer.

262
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,999
I'm just an insignificant web novelist.

263
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,200
I don't have any representative works or presence.

264
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,060
I'm just a meaningless and dispensable person in this world.

265
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,240
How can you say that?

266
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,179
Web novelists are amazing, unlike me.

267
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,600
When I write an 800-word composition,

268
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,620
I need to include punctuation to meet the word count.

269
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,180
Where can I read your novel? I want to appreciate them properly.

270
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,140
I... I think...

271
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,260
I think there's no need to read them.

272
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,760
I don't write well, and I don't want to lose my vest.

273
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,720
Wait till I write something good. I'll send it to you then.

274
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,799
Lose her vest?

275
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,720
Expose her online alias.

276
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
I won't ask.

277
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,900
What about you, Na Na?

278
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,800
I used to be a cashier at a cafe in Shanghai.

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,840
They laid off employees, so I drove over to Yunnan.

280
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,360
I came here by chance.

281
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,800
I really liked this place, so I stayed here to work.

282
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,500
<i>[Card]</i>

283
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,820
<i>Please remove your cash.</i>

284
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,800
<i>Please remove your card.</i>

285
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,960
You only need to change the screen.

286
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,780
The contents of the phone won't disappear, right?

287
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,120
Nope, the motherboard isn't damaged. Don't worry.

288
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
I have no screens in my store right now. It needs to be sent here.

289
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,500
Leave a number here for me. I'll call you when it's fixed.

290
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't have a mobile phone.

291
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,880
How about you leave me your number? I'll call you.

292
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,819
Okay, you can take this business card.

293
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,560
It'll take around three days.

294
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,100
Okay.

295
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,600
Do you have an alarm clock?

296
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,999
Nope.

297
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,160
What about a watch?

298
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
We don't have that either.

299
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,960
No one buys such things, so I don't order them.

300
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
Set an alarm with your phone.

301
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,440
That's more convenient.

302
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
My phone is broken, and I sent it to be fixed.

303
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
How much is it?

304
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,040
¥86.

305
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,320
How long will you stay here?

306
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,140
Three months.

307
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,200
Did you come to learn embroidery?

308
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,560
No. I'm just traveling.

309
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,200
Here's your change of ¥14.

310
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,880
Were you already friends with Brother A'Yao?

311
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,159
No, I don't know him.

312
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,820
But he let you ride Cutie Pie.

313
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
I stepped on cow dung.

314
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,960
I'll step on dung next time.

315
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,460
Whatever.

316
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,100
My name is Xiaoqin. What's your name?

317
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,420
Xu Hongdou.

318
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,640
So fancy.

319
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,960
I also have a fancy name. I picked it myself.

320
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Aren't you going to ask about my name?

321
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
What's your name?

322
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,140
My name is Candy.

323
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,020
Candy.

324
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,620
How about it? Fancy, right?

325
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,140
Fancy.

326
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,199
I'll let you get on with your work.

327
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,960
- Visit when you have the time.
- Okay.

328
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,380
Brother Xia Xia!

- Didn't you go to Guangzhou?
- Not yet.

330
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,920
My dad asked me to come to say goodbye to Master.

331
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,580
<i>- Stop there!</i>
- I have to run!

332
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,820
<i>Stop! Come back!</i>

333
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,120
Come back!

334
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,560
Take these back!

335
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,620
Why did you come here instead of staying at the wood carving workshop?

336
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,380
Well, perfect timing.

337
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,860
Take all these and return them back.

338
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,760
Tell their family to stop visiting during the holidays.

339
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
Go on.

340
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,240
Am I supposed to go?

341
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,599
Of course!

342
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,720
Hurry up and pick these up!

343
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,720
Why did you come looking for me?

344
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,680
It's nothing, Master.

345
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,500
We can talk tomorrow.

346
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,160
Don't totter and tell m.

347
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,840
Spit it out!

348
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,579
Master, I just...

349
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:26,500
I just want to travel to Shanghai for a few days and try to find a job there.

350
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,060
I heard from my friend in Shanghai that a wood carving studio there is recruiting.

351
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,120
I've never been anywhere else either. So, I just want to have a look.

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,260
They may not accept me.

353
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,200
Master, don't be angry.

354
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,220
Go ahead.

355
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,180
My small place can't contain your greatness.

356
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,220
Go ahead.

Would you like to join me for tea?

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,100
Sure. Let's go.

401
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Pu'er tea or black tea?

402
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm fine with either.

403
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,100

404

Pu'er tea.

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,400
- Are you bored?
- Nope.

406
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,300
You've only read a dozen pages.

407
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,600
A phone is still more fun, isn't it?

408
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
Yeah, it is.

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,400
But I can't be immersed in it all the time.

410
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
It's bad for the eyes.

411
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,600
I'll also feel empty.

412
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,700
When the human brain is stimulated,

413
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,200
it'll produce an intense reaction.

414
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
One's excitement threshold will keep increasing.

415
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,400
One's emotional control will deteriorate.

416
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,500
So... when you put down your phone,

417
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,000
you'll feel empty inside and bored.

418
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,200
After that,

419
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,400
you'll feel excitable and irritable.

420
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,400
As time passes,

421
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,500
you'll become a useless human being.

422
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,600
Can I still be salvaged?

423
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,100
Meditate.

424
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,800
What's on your mind when you meditate?

425
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
When you first start meditating,

426
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,600
you have to learn to control yourself.

427
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,800
Remove all distracting thoughts.

428
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:48,300
Focus your attention solely on your breathing.

429
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
What do I do after focusing on my breathing?

430
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Just concentrate on this.

431
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,100
That's it?

432
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,500
That's it.

433
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
It's best if you don't understand.

434
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Look at this tea.

435
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
Are you going to say that even tea

436
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,800
goes through trials and tribulations?

437
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,400
It needs to be fermented for a long time

438
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
to become tea.

439
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,100
In this world, everything needs to overcome obstacles and develop.

440
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,700
Right?

441
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,800
I mean... the tea is ruddy and gleaming.

442
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
We can drink it now.

443
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
Thank you.

444
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Aren't you picking up the call?

445
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,500
I don't have to.

446
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,700
I'm appreciating tea right now.

447
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Nothing else matters.

448
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,200
But... it's a little annoying.

449
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
My apologies.

450
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
The teacup is a little small.

451
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Can I have more?

452
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,700
Tea needs to be appreciated.

453
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Okay.

454
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,400
When will President Li go to Shuhe?

455
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,500
I'll head over too.

456
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,100
Make an appointment for me for that date.

457
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,400
<i>The wood carving workshop isn't part of your business.</i>

458
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,800
<i>Why are you so concerned about it? You're even traveling there personally.</i>

459
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll do whatever I can to help them.

460
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,300
After all, I call him my uncle. Right?

461
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,600
I can't just stand by and watch the wood carving workshop close down.

462
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
<i>Fine.</i>

463
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,700
<i>When President Li decides on the date, I'll let you know.</i>
- Thanks, buddy.

464
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,100
<i>Enough with the pleasantries. Let's chat when we meet.</i>

465
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,300
- Bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

466
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Dear Chairman Xie.

467
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,200
You're always butting into affairs. Even I feel tired.

468
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,600
You got a deal for him, but that won't resolve the entire issue.

469
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
Besides, he refuses to listen to you.

470
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You offered to help him for free,

471
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
but he's ridiculously wary of you.

472
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He's not wary of me.

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,600
He just thinks that publicity is like a potter praising his own pot.

474
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,500
It's shameless bragging.

475
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, your enthusiasm is wasting on an iceberg.

476
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,700
It's fine. He'll warm up if I continue for a while longer.

477
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
I love this aspect of you.

478
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Being enthusiastic to the aloof?

479
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
You have no shame, just like me.

480
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,100
No shame?

481
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,800
About our new webpage on tie dye painting...

482
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,200
Are you done with designing it?

483
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,400
Almost done.

484
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
I just finished designing the green plum packaging box.

485
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Wasn't that two days ago?

486
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
I think I'll return to crosstalk.

487
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Look. Zhou Bapi made a rooster crow at midnight.

488
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,900
You aren't even letting the rooster sleep.

489
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,600
Doesn't designing take time?

490
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
The design of the green plum packaging

491
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
was just an edit of an ugly apple.

492
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
You should hurry up.

493
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,700
I've already written up the advertisement for the tie dye paintings and green plums.

494
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,900
I'm just waiting for your image to post them on our official account.

495
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,100
All right, Madam. I'm sorry. My bad.

496
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,900
You're too lazy for crosstalk.

497
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm worried you'll starve to death even if you're begging for food on a skyway.

498
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,200
As fellow northerners, let's not bully each other.

499
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,300
Don't try to form a clique with me.

500
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
Hey.

501
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes, hello.

502
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,700
Is that so?

503
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay.

504
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
Xu Hongdou!

505
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,400
Your mom can't contact you, so she called my phone.

506
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,500
My mom can't contact me?

507
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
Call her back soon. She sounds very anxious.

508
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

509
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Chairman Xie.

510
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Would you like to join me for tea?

511
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Sure.

512
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,400
Hello, Mom. What's up?

513
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,300
Xiao Gang and his family want to travel to Beijing.

514
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't you have a staff discount?

515
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
It's a 20% discount, right?

516
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
How much is it with a 20% discount?

517
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,100
Over 900?

518
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,700
Sister, let me talk to Hongdou.

519
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,600
I'll let Aunty Sun talk to you.

520
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Hongdou, I'm Aunty Sun.

521
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,700
Aunty Sun.

522
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,600
Actually, Brother Xiao Gang and his wife

523
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,800
don't have to live in our hotel.

524
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Beijing's transportation is very convenient.

525
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,000
The subway is also efficient.

526
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Well, Dou...

527
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,400
It's because you're in Beijing. Right?

528
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,800
We only want to stay in that hotel for you.

529
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,400
You're a manager. An impressive leader.

530
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,700
Can't you charge a cheaper price?

531
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,300
It's really a bad time.

532
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm on vacation in Yunnan.

533
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,300
I can't attend to them.

534
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,800
Besides, the hotel prices aren't under my jurisdiction.

535
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
I can't call the shots.

536
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,700
How about this?

537
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,800
Let me know your acceptable price range.

538
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,600
I'll ask other friends in the industry

539
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,700
and recommend one that's good value for money.

540
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,700
- 500?
- 500, right?

541
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
Got it.

542
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,000
I'll help you choose a place.

543
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Okay. Thank you, Hongdou.

544
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,500
Thank you, Dou.

545
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,200
Come back more often.

546
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
I'll cook delicious food for you, all right?

547
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,300
You can talk to your mom. Okay.

548
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,300
<i>Dou, how has your trip been?</i>

549
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
Pretty fun.

550
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,800
My friends and I

551
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
drink tea in the yard and the such.

552
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
<i>Have you gotten your phone fixed?</i>

553
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,900
<i>I can't contact you, so I'm worried</i>

554
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
What's there to worry about? You don't call me every day.

555
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,700
It's one thing whether I call or not.

556
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,600
It's another thing that I can't get in touch with you.

557
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I got it repaired. I'll get it back in a few days.

558
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,200
<i>That's good. Have fun.</i>

559
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
<i>I'll hang up.</i>

560
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,000
Look at you.

561
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,100
How did you bring up your two daughters so well?

562
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,900
Both of them are so successful.

563
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,900
In the past, Xiao Gang used to be classmates with Hongmi.

564
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,500
- You remember, don't you?
- Yes.

565
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,900
One was always last and the other was always first.

566
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Xiao Gang is faring pretty well, too.

567
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,000
He inherited his dad's fertilizer factory and lives right next door.

568
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
If he wants to have dumplings, he can just holler for it.

569
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
It isn't the same with my two children.

570
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,400
Year after year, I don't even get to see them.

571
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,000
That depends on your perspective.

572
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Phones these days are so convenient!

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
We can even make video calls!

574
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,100
No matter the distance, it's the same.

575
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,700
Yeah, it's the same.

576
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,400
Nice.

577
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,800
You didn't tell your family about your resignation?

578
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,600
I'm afraid they'll jump to conclusions if they know.

579
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,200
Were there issues at work?

580
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Nope.

581
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,400
So, you just wanted to quit because work sucks?

582
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Not really.

583
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,700
All these years, the days passed.

584
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm feeling tired.

585
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,700
Don't you have any breaks?

586
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,400
Our industry is a little special.

587
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,200
Even during your rest days,

588
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,400
you also need to reply to messages

589
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
and answer calls from customers.

590
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,400
You can't relax.

591
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,000
So, when I'm not working, I just want to lie down.

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,700
Got it. Workers have no life.

593
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,200
Life is always elsewhere.

594
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,700
What we see before us is ephemeral.

595
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,000
This place is elsewhere.

596
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You've come to the right place.

597
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,100
Colorful Yunnan has fresh air. There isn't any pollution.

598
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,000
You should head out more often.

599
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Bask in the sun and enjoy good food.

600
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,600
After three months here, you'll be rejuvenated.

601
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,600
How long has Mr. Ma been here?

602
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,500
Less than one year.

603
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,800
He has absorbed the essence of the sun and the moon.

604
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
He's mutating.

605
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,100
There are signs of atavism. He no longer speaks normally.

606
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,300
No wonder he's annoying.

607
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,300
Let's talk about annoyance.

608
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,100
There's an ancient saying, "That which is beyond one cannot be governed."
<i>[Li Hao]</i>

609
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,600
Sorry. I need to answer the phone.

610
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,300
Hello, old classmate.

611
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,100
Yes, that's right. It's about a student transfer.

612
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,000
The student's academic status and registered residence are in Kunming.

613
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Inquire for me first.

614
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,300
Okay. I'll wait for news from you.

615
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,800
Okay. I'll treat you to a meal someday.

616
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Okay. Bye.

617
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Isn't your brother quitting school?

618
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,800
He can't just stay at home and make do.

619
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,700
Isn't computerized allocation based on registered residences?

620
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,800
It must be hard to transfer schools.

621
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Why isn't he studying near his registered residence?

622
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,100
He... doesn't want to attend school.

623
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,400
Is he bad at studies?

624
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,700
Not really.

625
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,900
He's just mischievous and lazy.

626
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,600
Let's talk about the laziness of human nature.

627
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,400
It's a long story since he doesn't have a mother.

628
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,900
I'll go and feed the horses.

629
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,600
Goodbye.

630
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,200
I won't see you off.

631
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,600
I... I need to look up hotels.

632
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
I'll head off, too.

633
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,100
Your tea was delicious. Thank you.

634
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
That which is beyond one cannot be governed,

635
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,400
but the heart needs to achieve emptiness.

636
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,400
Such wisdom.

637
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,200
Uncle.

638
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Eating alone?

639
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Let me add a dish for you.

640
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,200
I also have this red wine.

641
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
My good friend sent it to me. I'll share it with you.

642
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,000
Why are you here?

643
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,700
Xia Xia is going to Shanghai.

644
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,000
I guessed that he might've angered you.

645
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,200
So, I came to visit you.

646
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,200
I know you. You can't be at ease.

647
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
You're here to mock me, aren't you?

648
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,600
No, I'm not.

649
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,300
I just want to share a drink with you.

650
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm not accustomed to free wine.

651
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,400
Wine glowing in the luminous jade cups.

652
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,800
A pipa's melody urges us to march to battle.

653
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Don't laugh at drunken soldiers who collapsed on the battlefield.

654
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,100
How many warriors can even return from war?

655
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,600
Wine has existed since the Tang Dynasty.

656
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
How is it a foreign drink?

657
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
Come on.

658
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
Have a taste. Try it.

659
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Not bad.

660
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,200
Horse piss tastes better than this.

661
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,900
Drink it on your own.

662
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,800
I knew it might not be palatable for you.

663
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Try this instead.

664
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Cherry wine made by Aunty?

665
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,100
Fabulous.

666
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,900
Wonderful.

667
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
A'Yao, let me tell you this.

668
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,200
Back then, you were still young.

669
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,100
I bet you don't remember a thing.

670
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,300
I was a young man.

671
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,800
I led over a dozen wood carving craftsmen.

672
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Our skills were fantastic.

673
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,500
Whenever a family built a house,

674
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,600
they'd come to us.

675
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,000
There were folks from our village and from other villages.

676
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
All of them were looking for us.

677
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
The orders were endless.

678
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,600
They had to wait in line at the front gate.

679
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,800
The end of the line wasn't even in sight.

680
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Families who wanted their children to learn wood carving

681
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,300
would always gift me wine, meat, fruits, snacks, and more.

682
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,800
That was endless as well.

683
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,000
When did we ever need to beg others?

684
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,000
Others would come to us on their knees.

685
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,000
My son said this.

686
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,600
Times are different now!

687
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Everyone is using machine carving.

688
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
It's cheap and fast.

689
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,700
People are replaced by machines.

690
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,700
In the future, most people will be replaced by machines.

691
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,200
The government wants me to pass on the tradition.

692
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,500
Yet, nobody is willing to learn this.

693
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,800
Even if they do, well...

694
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,200
All the work will be done by machines.

695
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
There's no hope.

696
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,800
No hope.

697
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,700
That's not entirely true.

698
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,600
Machines are only capable of the fundamentals.

699
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,400
It can't replace humans.

700
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,600
That's because it lacks creativity.

701
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,600
Can machines make these relief works of yours?

702
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,200
Good things won't be replaced.

703
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
However, if no one knows about them,

704
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,700
no one can appreciate them,

705
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,200
they'll slowly vanish.

706
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,400
That's why we need promotion and publicity.

707
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,700
This is so that more people will be aware of this.

708
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,000
Only then can they grow to like this.

709
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Have you ever been to our embroidery workshop?

710
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,300
I won't go there.

711
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,200
All that internet stuff is nonsense.

712
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,000
I can't stand it.

713
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,000
Both you and Master Huailan accept apprentices.

714
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,100
Why does she have an increasing number of apprentices,

715
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,300
while yours are running off one by one?

716
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,200
