There are a few cases every year. It's nothing peculiar.

I won't take it personally.

108
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,130
I didn't poison them anyway.

Yes.

110
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,579
But they've just recovered from poisoning.

111
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,930
Their stomachs are frail.

112
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,259
Fish soup with tofu and millet congee are the best antidotes.

Crap! Put it down! It can't be eaten!

114

They cut mushrooms on this chopping board.

115
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,970
If it isn't washed thoroughly, they'll get food poisoning again.

<i>If you end up sitting in the sun with your legs crossed every day,</i>

162
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:18,430
<i>that'll truly scare us.</i>

163
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,080

<i>We don't want to smell your stinky feet.</i>

167
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,819
<i>I've been on a vegetarian diet lately.</i>

168
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:28,889
<i>They don't stink.</i>

169
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,129
<i>Hurry up and eat. The food is getting cold.</i>

170
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,649
<i>Tell us more about your business project.</i>

171
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,979
<i>Okay.</i>

172
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,300
<i>Let me tell you about it.</i>

173
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,230
Look, wasn't I right?

174
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,270
All parents share the same thoughts.

175
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,460
They aren't afraid to send their children through hardships.

176
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,889
Rather, they're worried their children will be like a hopeless lump of mud.

177
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:49,990
Aunty A'Gui,

178
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,009
you're truly a wise woman.

179
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,220
Don't flatter me.

180
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,020
Peel the garlic.

181
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
Okay.

182
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,590
Be careful. Watch your step.

183
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,989
I'm not that frail.

184
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,359
What nonsense. You're close to collapsing onto the floor.

185
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,609
Come on. Be careful.

186
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,180
Take it easy.

187
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,289
Watch your diet for the next few days.

188
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,110
Ruining your stomach is a serious problem.

189
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,810
Keep this on.

190
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,579
It's not that bad.

191
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,980
Cover yourself with it. Do as you're told.

192
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,719
You can't be careless with food. Look at you.

193
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,869
Aunty A'Gui made this.

194
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,429
It's good for digestion.

195
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,010
Have a good rest for a few days.

196
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,070
You're back.

197
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,509
Did you get the money?

198
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,440
Of course.

199
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,500
My parents saved money for my marriage.

200
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,060
How did you convince them?

201
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,430
We didn't dish things out properly. There was a misunderstanding.

202
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,410
They always thought that I was bent on becoming a monk.

203
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,920
Once I cleared the air and I told them about my business venture,

204
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,890
they were over the moon.

205
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,240
I see.

206
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,969
How much money did your parents save for your marriage?

207
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,869
Only a money-grubber like you would be concerned about that.

208
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:10,140
You're already in this state.

209
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,650
I'm curious.

210
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,220
It's a small amount for a new business.

211
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,749
But this is a token of their hearts. Right?

212
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,989
I'm charging ahead, and I have robust support behind me.

213
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,700
Yes.

214
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,799
Let's not talk about this.

215
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,399
Take good care of her. I have to check on Old Hu.

216
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,120
He's scratching holes everywhere. It's terrible.

217
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,229
Thank you.

218
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:36,280
Spare me the pleasantries.

219
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,080
Have you noticed that

220
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,500
Mr. Ma is different?

221
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,860
His assuredness right now gives him confidence.

222
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,510
Perhaps this is his true self.

223
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,330
He's a reckless man. Arrogant and haughty.

224
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,950
A real pain.

225
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,609
Hurry up and finish your food.

226
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:59,859
It's Aunty A'Gui's well wishes. She must be feeling horrible.

227
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,030
It's not her fault.

228
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,150
Did you print out all the photos taken by Damai?

229
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,680
Print a copy for me.

230
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,520
Why do you want them?

231
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,450
Well, why did you print them out?

232
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,170
I'll use them.

233
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,420
How many birds are there under your roof?

234
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,090
A couple more were hatched yesterday.

235
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,050
When did you put up a photo wall?

236
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,210
"Our agreement"?

237
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,010
Well...

238
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,980
They're just photos. It's nothing interesting.

239
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,660
What? Why are there photos of me?

240
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,019
- What are you collating?
- This is my privacy.

241
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,300
Please show some respect.

242
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,060
Come on. You've spent a whole night caring for us

243
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,609
and haven't had a good rest.

244
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:57,259
- Go and sleep.
- Be careful.

245
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,679
When you're done eating, text Old Ma.

246
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,110
- Get him to collect the dishes.
- Got it.

247
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,310
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

248
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,790
♫ <i>Whose dream will be fulfilled??</i> ♫

249
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,620
Brother Chang!

250
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,150
Back from cutting barley?

251
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,870
Yes.

252
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,679
When are you heading to Dayang's place?

253
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,999
In a few days.

254
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,339
I'll bring seafood back for you guys.

255
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,839
Don't bring that. We don't really enjoy it.

256
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,749
Okay, I'm off.

257
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,059
I'm delivering food to Zeqing.

258
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,860
Okay.

259
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,730
A'Hao!

260
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,649
- Aunty A'Gui, you're here.
- It's time to eat.

261
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,950
I'll eat as soon as I finish chopping this.

262
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Zeqing! Here's your food!

263
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,620
Okay.

264
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,789
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

265
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:56,709
Come over here.

266
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,110
Okay.

267
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,609
The incident this morning horrified me.

268
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:19,290
My heart was pounding as I walked here.

269
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,129
It's hard for parents to raise a child.

270
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:25,059
If they're hurt here, how are we supposed to explain to their family?

271
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,340
Thank goodness they're fine.

272
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,579
Don't harp on this.

273
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,450
I'm saying this for your own good.

274
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,879
Don't blabber when you're in Qingdao.

275
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,760
Don't tell Dayang and Xiao Xi about this.

276
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,120
If they find out, they'll chide me for being nosy again.

277
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,410
I won't talk about this.

278
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,800
It's Dayang!

279
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Dayang.

280
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,610
Have you eaten?

281
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,199
I'm not at home.

282
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:59,659
I'm at the horse ranch. I brought food over for your dad.

283
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,850
We're great.

284
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,050
Dayang, let me tell you something.

285
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,369
It rained several days ago, and mushrooms were flourishing.

286
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,199
They grew in bunches.

287
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,629
As soon as it stopped raining, your dad went up to the mountains

288
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,049
and picked a lot of termite mushrooms and ganbajun mushrooms.

289
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,509
I fried all of them for you.

290
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,670
I'll bring them over for you and Xiao Xi.

291
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,770
Listen to me.

292
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,989
I made an extra batch

293
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:26,469
for your superiors to try.

294
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,070
Okay?

295
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,530
Yes, go on.

296
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,490
Why?

297
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,080
Hold on.

298
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,490
Are you saying your dad and I aren't going over?

299
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,130
But you... you already booked the flight tickets.

300
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,610
Are you getting a refund?

301
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,409
No, not at all.

302
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,599
I'm not upset.

303
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,380
Your work is important.

304
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,369
Your dad and I can visit whenever we want.

305
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:16,470
Your work is more important.

306
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,839
Okay.

307
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,240
We won't go. Let's find another time.

308
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,940
Work hard.

309
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,929
Okay. I'll hang up.

310
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,940
You can get on with your work. Bye.

311
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,320
Oh, I'll send the mushrooms to you two.

312
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,739
Okay. All right.

313
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:33,879
Okay, goodbye.

314
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,070
Focus on your work.

315
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,890
That's really strange!

316
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,550
He doesn't want us to visit?

317
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,939
He said his superior is sending him on a business trip.

318
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,330
It's always the same reason.

319
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,640
The plane tickets were already booked.

320
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,450
He's busy.

321
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,680
He's busy.

322
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,969
Goodness. Forget it.

323
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,390
It's good to be busy.

324
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,070
How else can he pay the mortgage for such a huge house?

325
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,410
He must be busy.

326
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,380
You're right.

327
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,390
Well... We can visit some other time.

328
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,270
Don't be too depressed.

329
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,860
I won't be.

330
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,120
Work is more important.

331
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
His superior?

332
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,410
The tickets have already been bought.

333
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,860
Horrible excuse.

334
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,880
All right.

335
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,600
Inexplicable.

336
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,860
To be honest,

337
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,240
I didn't even want to go.

338
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,859
Even though the fields have been contracted out,

339
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,860
Zeqing and I still have proper jobs. Right?

340
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,839
If the children hadn't called

341
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,890
and bought the plane tickets,

342
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,019
I wouldn't have agreed to go.

343
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,120
Yes. You're absolutely right.

344
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,129
But that's how it is with work.

345
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,359
Whenever there's a problem, a single word from your supervisor forces you to up and leave for a business trip.

346
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,649
Exactly.

347
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,050
That's it.

348
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,110
A'Feng.

349
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,599
You don't have to work in the courtyard this time.

350
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,779
When I have another trip to Qingdao, I'll let you know.

351
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,930
You don't have to let me know.

352
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,470
Find someone else next time.

353
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Are you angry?

354
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,370
She's angry.

355
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,960
I asked you to take me to the courtyard before you leave

356
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,449
to teach me how to clean. You refused.

357
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:46,830
You made me head over twice. It's only ¥50 a day.

358
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,879
I can earn that money by weaving baskets at home with my husband.

359
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,700
A'Feng, I didn't mean for this to happen.

360
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,820
It's an unexpected turn of events.

361
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,710
Unexpected?

362
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,350
A'Feng!

363
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,049
Are you going to say that you don't care about that ¥50?

364
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,789
I know that your family is having it tough.

365
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,439
So, you're always the first person I think of when I have a good deal.

366
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,989
I'm on your mind?

367
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:25,830
Are you sure you aren't trying to add to my misery?

368
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,169
Why would I?

369
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,260
If you love bragging, go on with it.

370
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,930
I have a cursed life,

371
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,750
but my family isn't as poor as you think.

372
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:39,539
You don't have to advertise for me all day long

373
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,459
and blabber to everyone you meet. I don't need that.

374
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:45,239
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing in particular.

375
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:48,609
If you're done here, leave. I'm still at work.

376
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:49,910
I won't leave!

377
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,779
What do you mean by nothing in particular?

378
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,119
Please explain yourself.

379
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,910
Hey. What's going on? Why are you quarreling?

380
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,880
We aren't. Xiaochun, didn't you hear her?

381
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,709
What's that about bragging and advertisements?

382
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,169
What am I even promoting?

383
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:05,910
- It's the truth! So what?
- How have I ever offended you?

384
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,029
Explain what you just said.

385
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,059
Save the sarcasm!

386
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:12,889
Others are clueless, but both of us are clear.

387
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,260
When Dayang failed the college entrance examinations,

388
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,509
you refused to let him repeat high school.

389
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:23,769
You said that another four years of education would only get him a normal job.

390
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:26,219
You wanted him to work as a driver after graduating from high school.

391
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,059
I did all I could to persuade you.

392
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,520
If I didn't, Dayang would just be a deliveryman!

393
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,539
Back then, you even forced Xiao Xi to study accounting.

394
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,839
She ignored you for years.

395
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,369
She called me and asked me about everything.

396
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:42,519
Have you forgotten about all of these?

397
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,959
What do these ancient matters have to do with us right now?

398
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,439
You're hilarious!

399
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,350
- All right.
- You... You're just jealous.

400
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,229
You don't want others to live better than you.

401
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:53,150
Enough, Aunty A'Gui!

402
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,839
We're at work right now. Don't you have to cook at home?

403
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,290
Go home.

404
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,860
Xiaochun!

405
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,929
Look at what she's become now.

406
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,349
To be honest, she isn't as nice to me as she used to be.

407
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,309
Dayang is concerned about me.

408
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,909
He's afraid that I'll be tired, so he doesn't let me look after his children.

409
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:12,579
Why is she saying that Dayang is disdainful of me as a terrible caretaker?

410
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,679
It's the truth!

411
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,299
I'm just better off than you.

412
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,779
You only have one son, Xie Qiang.

413
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,069
He's still in jail!

414
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,399
Stop showing off here!

415
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,989
Don't talk about Xie Qiang!

416
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:26,599
You know I don't eat mushrooms, but you still gave them to us!

417
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,980
- Aunty A'Gui.
- Are you insane?
- All right. Leave.

418
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,029
Are you insane?

419
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,659
She doesn't eat mushrooms? Why?

420
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,099
Aunty A'Gui really has no filter for her mouth.

421
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:13,650
Doesn't she remember what she said?

422
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,599
Aunty Baoping is equally verbose.

423
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,229
She goes on about Xie Qiang being a bad example.

424
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:19,609
He stole and got into jail.

425
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:22,609
Yeah, and I chide her every time she says it.

426
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,880
Aunty Feng must feel horrible.

427
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,959
The only negative example to them is Xie Qiang.

428
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,170
But...

429
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,000
I think Aunty Feng is also in the wrong.

430
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,779
When Aunty A'Gui gave her mushrooms,

431
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,689
she flared up because she doesn't eat them.

432
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,709
Your preferences are your own issue. Right?

433
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:44,720
Gifts are tokens of someone's kindness.

434
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,529
Aunty A'Gui was really digging up all the sensitive topics.

435
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,120
What do you mean?

436
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,059
You know about Aunty Feng's daughter, right?

437
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,150
Of course.

438
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,689
Some years ago, she went with her classmates to the mountains to pick wild cherries

439
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,259
and accidentally fell into a ditch.

440
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,160
Yes.

441
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,819
They went to pick wild cherries.

442
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:09,370
But A'Yun fell because she saw mushrooms there and wanted to pick them.

443
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,899
It just happened to rain that day. The soil was loose, so she fell in.

444
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,749
The villagers only know that she went to pick wild cherries.

445
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:17,399
No one knew about the mushrooms.

446
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,049
The students who went with her told Aunt Feng's family that

447
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,729
she wanted to pick some mushrooms to earn money for her family.

448
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,440
But... Aunty A'Gui has such close ties with Aunty Feng.

449
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,550
Doesn't she know about this?

450
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,919
Aunty Feng doesn't want to appear weak.

451
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,719
How would others know if she doesn't say a word?

452
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,690
How do you know?

453
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,159
Xie Qiang told me.

454
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,229
Right.

455
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,520
You're childhood friends with Xie Qiang.

456
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,859
Take those buns out. I'll cook the porridge.

457
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,680
- Are they ready?
- Yeah.

458
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,889
It's cold at night.

459
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:57,840
Stay in your rooms.

460
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,869
Have a good rest for a few days and let your stomachs recover.

461
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,950
Damai, does your stomach still hurt?

462
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,890
I'm much better.

463
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,610
Thank you. Sorry to trouble you.

464
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,080
Don't say that.

465
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,200
Only friends trouble each other from time to time.

466
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,099
The people you don't trouble are strangers.

467
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,700
Right?

468
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,929
I'm back! Is there food for me?

469
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:24,310
Yes. Let me get you a bowl.

470
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,540
Come on. Have a seat.

471
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,300
I'm so hungry my stomach is eating itself.

472
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,750
I only ate some biscuits for lunch.

473
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,770
I'm dying.

474
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,349
The cafe is only crowded when the cafe is understaffed.

475
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,689
Was the cafe crowded today?

476
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,849
A group of students from the Academy of Fine Arts came to sketch.

477
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,149
They said Granny Xiuying's clothes were beautiful and insisted on having her as their model.

478
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,209
They sketched for an entire afternoon.

479
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,230
Wasn't Xiaochun at the cafe?

480
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,479
I'm covering Chuchu's shift at the warehouse.

481
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:57,079
Granny Caiyun took Chuchu to Xiaguan for her mom's birthday.

482
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,570
Granny Caiyun is so old.

483
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,260
Is her mom still alive?

484
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,749
She's 96 years old.

485
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:07,539
She plays Mahjong every single day. As long as she wins some money, she'll be over the moon.

486
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,960
She even buys snacks for Granny Caiyun.

487
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,190
Listen to this.

488
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,949
Even though Granny Caiyun is 70 years old, she has three elder brothers.

489
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:19,650
She's the pampered youngest daughter of her family.

490
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,839
Whenever her brothers find good food,

491
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,349
they'll ask their children to deliver the food to Granny Caiyun.

492
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,670
She's so blessed.

493
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,299
- She's 70 years old, but she's still loved by her mom and brothers.
- Exactly.

494
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,979
Exactly. Aunty Feng always says that

495
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,450
Granny Caiyun is the most fortunate person she has ever met.

496
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,159
If she were half as lucky as Granny Caiyun, she would burn incense and bow down every day.

497
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,130
Is Aunty Feng's life bad?

498
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,310
She's too unfortunate.

499
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,790
You can't say that.

500
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,119
We can't draw conclusions until the moment we die.

501
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,799
Aunty Feng and Uncle Chang aren't that old, and Xie Qiang will be released soon.

502
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,820
Their better days are yet to come.

503
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,360
Released?

504
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,600
Is her son in jail?

505
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,739
Here's the thing.

506
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:13,450
Her son, Xie Qiang, are childhood friends with him and Brother Guanjun.

507
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,059
After graduating from high school, he didn't get into college.

508
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,129
Aunty Feng told him to repeat high school, but he didn't heed her words.

509
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:23,689
He found a temporary job in a company to guard their warehouse.

510
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,919
At that time, he got to know a group of layabouts.

511
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,179
They drank and stirred trouble all day long while claiming to be brothers.

512
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,369
These people knew that Xie Qiang worked at the warehouse.

513
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:37,619
So, they egged him on to steal the steel and cables in the warehouse

514
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:40,140
to sell as scrap.

515
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,440
I remember that they were sold for tens of thousands of yuan.

516
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,179
But, in fact, those were worth hundreds of thousands.

517
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:52,980
They were caught only after a year.

518
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,140
That's so foolish.

519
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,470
He was led astray.

520
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,190
At that time, his sentence could be reduced if he paid the money for those.

521
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,860
Aunty Feng and Uncle Chang went from house to house in the village to borrow money.

522
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,330
They were riddled in debt.

523
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,280
The old couple has lived frugally these past few years

524
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,120
and even try to work all day long.

525
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:20,859
They don't just work in the orchard.

526
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,649
When they have time, they weave baskets and make brooms.

527
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,610
They're having a hard time.

528
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
Let's not talk about this.

529
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,109
Enjoy your meal. Be careful of indigestion.

530
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:33,540
These buns are good.

531
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,360
I made the stuffing, and Granny made the buns.

532
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,009
I need to eat more. Tomorrow, they're coming to sketch again.

533
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:43,010
I've recovered. I'll go to the cafe tomorrow.

534
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,529
You don't have to come. Just rest well.

535
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,350
I'm fine.

536
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,650
Damai is having it worse.

537
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,619
Luckily, I finished the 3,000-word chapter yesterday before I fell ill.

538
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,040
Is writing more important than your life?

539
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,500
As long as I'm alive, I have to post updates.

540
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,070
Why am I so tired?

541
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,190
I can't eat anymore.

542
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Have some food first.

543
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,600
Okay.

544
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,980
I'm pretty hungry.

545
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,429
This roof above the stove needs to be repaired. Soil is trickling down.

546
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:46,020
We'll have to wait until the plums are harvested.

547
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,320
When eating, look carefully...

548
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,910
"Our agreement. "

549
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,009
"Good food." "Interesting places."

550
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,360
"The people I adore." "Leave it to fate."

551
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,560
What do these mean?

552
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,220
♫ <i>The raindrops from the roof drip into my eyes quietly</i> ♫

553
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,600
♫ <i>The world is like a quiet island</i> ♫

554
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,599
<i>[Blackie is very aloof.]</i>
♫ <i>The sky is turning bright without a sound</i> ♫

555
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,519
<i>[The people I adore (Leave it to fate)]</i>
♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

556
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,999
♫ <i>Waiting for a ray of sunlight to shine across
the lake into my heart</i> ♫

557
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,800
♫ <i>Set sail when it's windy</i> ♫

558
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,700
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,
and the starry sky</i> ♫

559
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,820
♫ <i>Disoriented footsteps will gradually be erased</i> ♫

560
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,899
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

561
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,400
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

562
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,700
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

563
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,369
♫ <i>I'll head to a windy place</i> ♫

564
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:42,649
I can't bear to let you go. Time flies by too quickly.

565
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,659
It's no big deal. I often head to Changsha for work.

566
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,319
When I'm there, you have to treat me to good food.

567
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,719
No problem.

568
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,510
If you're there, I'll take care of everything for you!

569
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,099
Okay. When are you heading home?

570
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,520
In two weeks.

571
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,650
That's so soon.

572
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,630
You're reluctant to leave, aren't you?

573
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,510
Actually, everyone is really nice to you.

574
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,050
I know.

575
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,760
There is also the kindness you're unaware of.

576
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,850
<i>Help Damai?</i>

577
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,530
<i>Recently, Damai is considering giving up writing and getting a job.</i>

578
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,010
<i>Actually, all of us can tell that she's very anguished</i>

579
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,630
<i>and torn because she still loves writing.</i>

580
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,739
<i>As her friend, I don't want to stand by and do nothing.</i>

581
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,680
<i>I want to give her a push.</i>

582
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,860
<i>What can I do?</i>

583
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,059
<i>Damai is a real homebody, and her schedule is irregular.</i>

584
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>Her days and nights are upturned.</i>

585
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,650
<i>When she can't write, she's even more likely to coop herself up in her room.</i>

586
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,440
<i>She'll also be in a terrible mental state.</i>

587
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,739
<i>Here's what I think.</i>

588
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,669
<i>Both of you are creatives.</i>

589
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,259
<i>You also get along pretty well.</i>

590
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:12,150
<i>Perhaps you offer her more encouragement.</i>

591
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,589
<i>At the very least, get her to leave her room more often.</i>

592
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,399
<i>It's good for her health as well.</i>

593
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:18,860
<i>That's no problem.</i>

594
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,910
<i>I want to ask Damai for a favor anyway.</i>

595
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,721
<i>But why is someone as talented as her giving up?</i>

596
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:27,000
<i> - Right? You think so too?
- Yeah.</i>

597
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,169
<i>Actually, Damai is a pretty good writer.</i>

598
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:31,129
<i>Those comments are just too inexplicable.</i>

599
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,430
<i>Stuff about how things aren't sweet enough.</i>

600
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,309
<i>This is a suspense and mystery story. Why the heck would it be sweet?</i>

601
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,160
<i>There are even those</i>

602
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,579
<i>complaining about the heroine's five-year relationship. They say it's disgusting.</i>

603
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,109
<i>I'm furious.</i>

604
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:44,879
<i>There are even people denigrating the writer!</i>

605
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,679
<i>They say this writer must have psychological problems.</i>

606
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,710
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

607
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,730
<i>You can ignore such comments.</i>

608
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,569
<i>Anyway, Hongdou and I think she writes really well.</i>

609
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:58,999
<i>You have to read it.</i>

610
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,549
<i>You must!</i>

611
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,250
<i>Okay.</i>

612
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,990
<i>By the way, I...</i>

613
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,919
<i>I have to ask for Damai's consent before sending her page to you.</i>

614
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,359
<i>Let me ask her.</i>

615
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,650
<i>Don't worry. I'll ask her.</i>

616
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,219
<i>Remember to tell her that you love suspense and romance novels.</i>

617
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:21,820
<i>Okay.</i>

618
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,000
Damai, don't bear your burdens alone when you face obstacles.

619
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,230
Sometimes, you can count on your friends.

620
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,540
Hongdou!

621
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,190
Hongdou! Are you up?

622
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,109
<i>Give me a second.</i>

623
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:03,660
Okay.

624
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,190
<i>What's wrong?</i>

625
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,569
Damai sent me a reply.

626
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,180
Let me read it to you.

627
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,179
I've read all your comments.

628
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,539
Your encouragement and support are very important to me.

629
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:16,779
I will do my best in writing.

630
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:19,060
Love you, and thank you. Muah.

631
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,549
You came knocking so early in the morning. I thought there was trouble.

632
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,989
She replied to you, too.

633
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,549
She even replied to all the other accounts I made.

634
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:27,719
She hasn't read the comments in ages.

635
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,409
Now, she's back to reading them. She even updated yesterday.

636
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,720
Your strategy is fantastic.

637
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,259
From now on, we'll be Damai's most loyal readers.

638
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:40,150
We have to silently watch over her.

639
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,230
Damai!

640
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,439
Hello, good morning.

641
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,719
- Morning.
- Good morning.

642
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,020
I burned the midnight oil and haven't slept a wink.

643
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,130
Did your writing go well?

644
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,230
I didn't write anything.

645
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,310
Why didn't you write again?

646
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,699
That's because creation

647
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,589
is a combination of self-doubt, tears, countless late nights,

648
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:15,440
and the occasional flash of inspiration.

649
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,760
Exactly!

650
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,350
Mr. Hu, did you compose your song?

651
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,269
Couldn't produce anything.

652
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,359
Is he okay?

653
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,470
I'm the same!

654
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,220
Uncle Chang! Uncle Chang!

655
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,770
The Fifth Hospital, right?

656
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,619
Okay. I-I'm coming.

657
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:06,719
I'm coming.

658
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,270
Aunty Feng, what's wrong?

659
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,109
My husband fainted.

660
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:12,399
I have to go home to get his ID and money.

661
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,639
Where's my phone?

662
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,280
Over here.

663
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,159
Aunty Feng, don't panic.

664
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,839
- It may not be serious.
- Why did he faint?

665
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,270
Why did he faint?

666
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,070
I'm...

667
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,230
Arrogant.

668
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,510
I'm not here for you.

669
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,570
I'm here for Baoping.

670
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,630
Chuchu.

671
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,069
Aunty A'Gui, Uncle Chang fainted.

672
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:39,649
Aunty Feng is in panic. Will she be okay all by herself?

673
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:41,270
He fainted?

674
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,840
No way.

675
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,899
Don't worry. I'll check on her.

676
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:47,829
This is for Baoping. One is for A'Feng.

677
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:49,349
Okay. Be careful.

678
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,840
Okay.

679
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,250
A'Feng!

680
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,369
Get on!

681
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,549
I'll take you to the hospital.

682
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,949
I'm going to The Fifth Hospital. My husband fainted.

683
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,990
- Hurry up.
- I know. Sit tight.

684
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,659
Is he in any danger?

685
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,219
I was freaked out.

686
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,120
A'Yao!

687
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,059
- Aunty Feng! Aunty A'Gui.
- How is my husband?

688
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,339
Uncle Chang is fine.

689
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:25,519
He's awake and on an IV drip in there.

690
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,120
Okay.

691
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,370
How are you?

692
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,700
I'm fine.

693
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,920
A'Yao, Uncle Chang fainted. What did the doctor say?

694
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,569
He is anemic due to malnutrition.

695
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:39,439
His hemoglobin is only 70 grams.

696
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,020
Is that serious?

697
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,219
Yes, a little.

698
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:44,020
It's terrible.

699
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,179
If I hadn't seen him while passing by,

700
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,779
he'd be in deep trouble lying out there.

701
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:51,129
That's true. We owe our thanks to Second Brother.

702
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:52,619
Thank goodness.

703
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,420
It's nothing.

704
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,330
- A'Yao, I'll get going first.
- Okay.

705
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,319
- I'm leaving.
- Take care.

706
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,140
Don't worry.

707
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,230
You scared me.

708
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,390
A'Yao, you stay here.

709
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,489
I'll head back, too.

710
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:13,480
Aren't you going in to take a look?

711
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,109
I didn't bring anything.

712
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:18,529
I feel bad going in.

713
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:20,870
Keep an eye on them. I'm off.

714
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,350
Where is A'Gui and Xiao Qin's dad?

715
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,589
They went back.

716
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:28,599
They left?

717
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,179
The doctor also said that when Uncle Chang gets better,

718
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:34,289
take him to a hospital in the city for a full body check-up.

719
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,039
Does he need supplements for anemia?

720
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,459
Yes. I'll explain it to you.

721
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,519
Granny, step back. The oil will splatter and scald you.

722
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,710
Flip it over.

723
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,109
Stir-fried vegetables go with light soy sauce.

724
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:13,380
You're adding dark soy sauce.

725
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,279
It's fine.

726
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:16,149
This is how we do it in my hometown.

727
00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:18,640
Your hometown's cooking method?

728
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,400
Well, add less salt.

729
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,790
Okay.

730
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,890
Don't add too much.

731
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,060
Is this enough?

732
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,670
Add a little more.

733
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,780
Okay.

734
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,490
