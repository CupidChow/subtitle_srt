Does she need our help.

4
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,030
Nope. She can do it alone.

5
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,730
We'd better not intervene unless the foal is in a poor position for birth.

Thank you for your help.

16
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,890
I've injected the Tetanus vaccine,

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,450
and it has drunk the mare's milk.

18
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,600
Right now, the foal is safe.

19
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,530
Thank you very much.

20
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,230
Give me a call if there is an emergency.

21
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,530

Brilliant, right?

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,990
Foals can stand shortly after birth.

28
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,300
That's the only way it can suckle.

29
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,830
In just an hour, it'll be able to roam with the mare.

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,990
Aunty A'Gui called Uncle Zeqing home for dinner.

38
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,260
He has to keep watch at night.

39

I'm asking, why am I doing this?

40
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,180
Shouldn't you thank me?

41
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,810
I gave you the chance to witness the birth of a life.

42
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,420
Dinnertime!

43
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,000
I saw you cry this afternoon.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,890
I was a little touched.

45
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,320
It's a rare scene for city folks like you.

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,040
For us, our family always reared livestock.

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,490
Chopping firewood in the mountains, picking mushrooms,

48
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,820
and farming the land are part of our daily lives.

49
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,050
I'm not a city girl.

50
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,760
I was born in a small town.

51
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,040
My grandma lived in the countryside.

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,980
When I was a child, I'd visit her during vacations.

53
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,470
I used to catch fish in the brooks!

54
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,840
I even hatched eggs myself!

55
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,400
How did you do that?

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,510
I put the eggs in my pockets

57
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,640
and kept them in my hands except for mealtimes.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,620
My grandma said people cannot hatch eggs, but my sister said we could.

59
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,690
My sister said most people can't do so because they lack persistence.

60
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,620
Whose opinion did you believe?

61
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,290
I wanted to prove my persistence.

62
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,320
What happened?

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,330
The chick was hatched.

64
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,110
- Really?
- It's true!

65
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,820
You can't lie to me because I lack education.

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,500
It's true.

67
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,460
<i>Sister.</i>

68
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,330
<i>Can you hold them for ten minutes for me?</i>

69
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,750
<i>I'll take a quick shower.</i>

70
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,500
<i>You always ask me to hold them for you.</i>

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,900
<i>When the chicks are hatched, they'll be mine to eat when they're bigger.</i>

72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,740
<i>You can't eat them!</i>

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,800
<i>Fine, off you go.</i>

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,860
<i>You only have ten minutes.</i>

75
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,490
<i>Hurry up.</i>

76
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,020
<i>I swapped the eggs with boiled ones.</i>

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
<i>What about the raw eggs?</i>

78
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,530
<i>I put them in the henhouse.</i>

79
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,570
<i>I was afraid she'd break them.</i>

80
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,840
<i>Have some more.</i>

81
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,400
<i>A hen only takes care of the chicks hatched by itself.</i>

82
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,060
<i>So, before the chick is hatched, we must put the eggs in the henhouse.</i>

83
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,970
<i>Turn around. Don't look.</i>

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,440
<i>No peeping!</i>

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,070
<i>Hongmi, keep an eye on Dou Dou.</i>

86
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,660
<i>Make sure she doesn't peep.</i>

87
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,480
<i>Go over there.</i>

88
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,220
<i>All done.</i>

89
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,090
<i>We just have to wait for the chicks to hatch.</i>

90
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,590
<i>Sister! Look!</i>

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,010
<i>Amazing! You're our Hatching General!</i>

92
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
When did you find out?

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
In junior high school.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,620
My sister was taking the college entrance examinations.

95
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,760
My dad said she could go to Fudan University.

96
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,860
Then, she burst out laughing,

97
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,450
saying that I should apply for the University of Hatching Eggs.
<i>("Fudan" sounds like "hatching eggs")</i>

98
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,160
Your sister is pretty good at keeping secrets.

99
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,090
My sister had a hand in tricking me

100
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,650
every step of the way as I grew up.

101
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,800
- Is it too tight?
- Nope.

102
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,090
Sister. I washed the dishes. I'm heading to work.

103
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,470
Uncle, take me with you.

104
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm busy this weekend. You can't tag along. Why not play with Guobao and the others?

105
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Tuotuo invited Guobao, Huzi, and me

106
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,100
to the cafe for cakes.

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,670
Wait for her. I'm almost done with braiding her hair.

108
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,470
What a hassle.

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,040
It won't take long.

110
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,120
Sister, it's Mr. Bow Legs.

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,230
Don't you call my dad names. Apologize.

112
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,100
I'm sorry. Pick it up.

113
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,140
I need to use the bathroom.

114
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,510
Dad!

115
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,680
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

116
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
I do! Are you coming to visit me?

117
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,470
<i>Where's your mom?</i>

118
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,150
She's beside me.

119
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,120
She's braiding my hair prettily.

120
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
I have a date today.

121
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,370
That's not a date. Don't be silly.

122
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,610
All done.

123
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,760
Give me the phone. You can check if your uncle is done.

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,140
- Dad, I'm leaving.
<i>- Okay.</i>

125
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,620
Off you go.

126
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,910
What's up?

127
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,610
<i>I just called Mom.</i>

128
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,840
<i>I'm thinking of visiting Xiao Hu Lu next month.</i>

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,470
<i>She asked me to talk to you.</i>

130
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,270
Sure, you can come.

131
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,590
<i>I'll go over then.</i>

132
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,990
Just call me next time.

133
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,870
Stop calling my mom and Xia Xia.

134
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,650
<i>Well, I... I...</i>

135
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,890
Are you seeing someone now?

136
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,310
<i>I'm not!</i>

137
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,140
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

138
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,390
I thought you were dating someone and didn't want to piss her off.

139
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,150
<i>I'm afraid you'd be annoyed by me.</i>

140
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,220
Don't worry.

141
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,250
For Xiao Hu Lu's sake, I won't be annoyed at you.

142
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,200
By the way, Luo Quan, we divorced three years ago.

143
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,150
You can get a girlfriend or even get married if you want.

144
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,530
I've talked to Xiao Hu Lu about it.

145
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,800
Don't worry about that.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,690
<i>Do you have a boyfriend now?</i>

147
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,210
Mind your own business.

148
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,340
That's all. I'm heading to work.

149
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,260
Remember to send my regards to your parents.

150
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>Take care of yourself. Don't work too hard.</i>

151
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,310
You too. Got to go.

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,350
The orange juice. Don't work too hard.

153
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll give you a fruit platter if you're still hungry after the desserts.

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,880
Children shouldn't eat too many sweets. Got it?

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,650
What's wrong? Why are you so gloomy?

156
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,900
Tuotuo is leaving.

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,750
- Where to?
- Somewhere very far away.

158
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,570
My dad will be a driver there.

159
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,140
My mom will sell flowers.

160
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,980
It's okay.

161
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,080
You can still call each other.

162
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,520
Tuotuo can come here during school vacations.

163
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,080
You can still hang out together.

164
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
But, right now, we have fun together every day.

165
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,940
Why can't you stay at home?

166
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,150
Your grandparents are staying here.

167
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,670
Yeah, why do you have to go?

168
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,140
It's not that far.

169
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,810
My dad, grandpa, grandma,

170
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,930
Uncle A'Yao's dad, and aunt,

171
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,670
and Uncle A'Yuan all live there.

172
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,380
Sister Na Na is right.

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,030
We can call each other.

174
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,350
Will we still be best friends?

175
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,430
Of course.

176
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,670
Promise us that you won't have other best friends.

177
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,520
I promise. The three of you will be my only best friends.

178
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,850
Really?

179
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,960
Will I still be your best friend?

180
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,390
It's no big deal. Stop crying.

181
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,530
Let's have desserts.

182
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,570
Did someone beat up Guobao?

183
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,420
There, there. Calm down.

184
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,430
There, there.

185
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,020
Here I am!

186
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,420
A double-shot Iced Americano, right?

187
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,960
In a minute.

188
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,190
Who's that?

189
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,540
Ponytail? What happened?

190
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,350
He's crying so badly.

191
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,360
Kids are so unpredictable, just like the weather in June.

192
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,520
By the way, when I left the courtyard,

193
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,300
I saw Xu Hongdou writing an employee manual.

194
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,230
You guys sure have your tricks.

195
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,640
She's taking a holiday here, but look what she's doing.

196
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,920
You coaxed her into working for you free of charge.

197
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,380
That's beyond me.

198
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,100
Chairman Xie persuaded her.

199
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,330
No surprises there. Never trust a man's word.

200
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,930
Everything he utters is a lie.

201
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,540
Aren't you a man, too?

202
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,670
Are you jealous because Hongodu prefers Chairman Xie over you?

203
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,830
Bingo.

204
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,620
None of you hang out with me.

205
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,400
I'm angry.

206
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,430
Jiahui.

207
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,510
Having your meal? Good cat.

208
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,330
Don't run away.

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,940
Holy hells!

210
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,700
Have you reached the stage of meditating with your eyes open?

211
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,730
Mr. Ma, you're reaching enlightenment soon.

212
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,960
Jiahui.

213
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,040
Have some water.

214
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,980
Aunty A'Gui, want to join me for tea?

215
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,240
Sure, get me some.

216
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,380
Hongdou, let's take a break.

217
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,570
Mr. Ma is making tea. Come over and have some.

218
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,320
Sure.

219
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,310
Hongdou, I heard from the villagers that you're tending the shop for A'Yao.

220
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,020
Are you planning to stay here?

221
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,100
No, no.

222
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,730
I'm just a volunteer. I work for free.

223
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,440
- I'm helping him out.
- Helping him out?

224
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,780
Good for you.

225
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,850
We have to keep ourselves busy.

226
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,710
Laziness is a disease.

227
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,800
She's talking about me. Have some tea.

228
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,430
Thank you.

229
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,170
It smells great.

230
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,940
This tastes pretty nice.

231
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,510
But... it just tastes like tea.

232
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Aunty A'Gui, your words are overflowing with Zen.

233
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,020
It's a cup of tea.

234
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,670
That's all it should be.

235
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,030
I only finished elementary school, so I'm not good with words.

236
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,940
Don't mock me.

237
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,840
Your words are full of wisdom.

238
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,910
It's so hard to understand what he says.

239
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,690
I know. It's strenuous to communicate with me.

240
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,640
It's understandable that you're not fond of me.

241
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Hongdou, isn't he hilarious?

242
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,380
We all eat grains.

243
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,240
Burping, farting, and grinding our teeth are all parts of our lives.

244
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,020
We should spend our day working.

245
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,410
We can never rest.

246
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,500
We must take good care of the elderly and children.

247
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,020
Living is painstaking.

248
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,110
Only if you're dead and six feet under, then you can finally rest.

249
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,730
Aren't I right?

250
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,240
In our village, people your age have children in junior high school.

251
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,940
Why would someone squander his time sitting there?

252
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,980
You can't support your family by sitting there.

253
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,440
That's one way of thinking.

254
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,240
However, as long as someone can live on his own

255
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,800
without harming others,

256
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,120
he has the right to freely choose the life he wants to live.

257
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,380
Don't you agree?

258
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,910
When it comes to freedom,

259
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,780
only an orphan can be truly free to choose the life they want.

260
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,310
If you have family,

261
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,150
you have to spare a thought for them.

262
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,450
If you're lazing away, they'll have to work hard.

263
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,120
If you sit there,

264
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,520
they'll have to strive harder for a living.

265
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,200
Visitors like you guys always say

266
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,470
an unrestrained life is the best as long as you obey the law.

267
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,110
You can do whatever you want.

268
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,900
Here's a question for you.

269
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,400
What if you're starving out there?

270
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,940
Who will take care of you?

271
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,810
Your parents will get old and fall sick.

272
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,440
You'll need money for your own emergencies,

273
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
but you don't have any.

274
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,780
What are you going to do then?

275
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,150
It's too late to start scrimping for money.

276
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,480
Aunty A'Gui,

277
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,350
a single chat with you is more insightful than ten years of studying.

278
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm just blabbing.

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't take my words too seriously.

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,880
You've made your point clearly.

281
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,160
I can't let such wisdom go to waste. That'll be just like letting cows eat peonies.

282
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,100
Why would a cow eat peonies?

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,270
Why would a cow...

284
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,590
The reason doesn't matter.

285
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,960
The food it's eating doesn't matter either.

286
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,560
Here's what I mean.

287
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,680
I'm sitting here to resist my diligence.

288
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,300
Pitting stasis against all motion.

289
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,690
Do you understand a word he's saying?

290
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,800
I see your mouth moving, but the sentences

291
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,860
don't quite make sense.

292
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,010
Simply put,

293
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,000
the Pareto principle applies to everything.

294
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,210
Oftentimes, even if you try hard and devote yourself to your task,

295
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,970
all your efforts may just be in vain.

296
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,670
Since your efforts will go to waste, why bother at all?

297
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:56,060
Well... Isn't it better to cope with change and motion with stasis?

298
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,260
That's true wisdom.

299
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,890
I get it now.

300
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,920
However, you're preaching to the wrong person.

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,120
I can't help you.

302
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,810
In our lives,

303
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,590
we're born with nothing on.

304
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,500
When we die, we take nothing with us.

305
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,100
Life is arduous,

306
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,870
but you can't end your life because you're going to die.

307
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,930
Only the air you breathe in is free.

308
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,810
Everything else comes at a price.

309
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,010
Can you stay still forever?

310
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,780
If you can't, go and get a job!

311
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,770
You don't have to be the boss.

312
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,460
Besides, let's assume you're a boss,

313
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,540
a billionaire rolling in the cash.

314
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,320
Your money...

315
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,210
can fill the entire yard here.

316
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,770
A bottomless pit of wealth.

317
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,700
Here's my question for you.

318
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,380
What if you die?

319
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,410
Can you take all these with you?

320
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,460
They're meaningless to a dead person.

321
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,860
How about paper effigies,

322
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,640
cars, houses, villas, paper dolls, and banknotes of hundreds of billions?

323
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,880
You name it.

324
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,620
It won't cost a fortune for others to buy all these and burn them for you.

325
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,480
to buy all these and burn them for you.

326
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
Right?

327
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,480
I hate talking about such things.

328
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,940
It's just small talk, so don't take my words seriously.

329
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,710
I'm done with chatting.

330
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,540
I need to get back to work.

331
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,410
Wait. Don't leave.

332
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,390
Blackie, don't step on my flowers!

333
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,970
True wisdom.

334
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,240
Worthy of the classics.

335
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,750
I'm enlightened.

336
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,230
Let's have some tea.

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
<i>[Working at full speed]</i>

338
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,380
<i>[Chapter 126]</i>

339
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,670
<i>[Chapter 126]</i>

340
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,980
Damai, you scared me.

341
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,020
Mr. Ma.

342
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,090
Do you want some food?

343
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,460
What are you making?

344
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,710
Rice vermicelli.

345
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,340
Tottering rice vermicelli.

346
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Rice vermicelli with a toddler?

347
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,050
Is a calf in it?

348
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,120
That's not it.

349
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,750
Man makes mistakes, just like a horse may totter.

350
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,400
My last name means horse.

351
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,170
So, I'm making tottering rice vermicelli.

352
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,870
Want some of it?

353
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,380
Yes, please. Thank you.

354
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,010
Are you running out of inspiration for writing?

355
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,870
Why are you feeling stressed out?

356
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,260
Reader comments, my income, and my inability to write.

357
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,750
Why can't you write?

358
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,400
Reader comments and my income.

359
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,390
It's a vicious cycle.

360
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,650
Does your family support your job?

361
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,880
My mom does, but my dad doesn't.

362
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,870
Does he think it's an unstable job?

363
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,400
It's more than that.

364
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,280
He thinks it's humiliating.

365
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,350
Writing is humiliating?

366
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,550
Why?

367
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,310
When I started with web novels,

368
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,610
I wrote some fan fiction with explicit scenes.

369
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,540
After that, I became a full-time web novelist.

370
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,510
My 15-year-old cousin

371
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,250
found those fan fiction when searching for my work online.

372
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,670
She sent them to her classmates, and the entire class knew about them.

373
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,040
To make things worse, she bragged that her cousin wrote them.

374
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,340
Eventually, their form teacher found out.

375
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,440
After the form teacher grasped the situation,

376
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,510
she spoke to her colleague, Mr. Zhou.

377
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,910
That colleague is my dad.

378
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,450
He shot to fame in school thanks to me.

379
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,600
But I quit writing fan fiction when I became a full-time web novelist.

380
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,730
I started to write original fiction about mystery and romance.

381
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,950
But my dad is still against my job.

382
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,370
I graduated from a normal university, so he wants me to be an elementary school teacher.

383
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,720
He thinks that'll help me find a husband.

384
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,390
I even get summer and winter vacation to spend with my family.

385
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,930
A parent's love for their children

386
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,260
leads them to make long-term plans for you.

387
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,320
Damai, here's my advice.

388
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,210
If we keep looking at the ground

389
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,090
and following our parents' footsteps while marching forward,

390
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,700
we can never find a new path.

391
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,930
You have to pave your own path.

392
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,910
However, it will be a path

393
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,610
full of thorns and obstacles.

394
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,900
What's worse, there might be tigers and wolves lurking in the darkness.

395
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,910
But don't worry.

396
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,900
It won't always be like that.

397
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,980
Every dog has its day.

398
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,470
One day, you'll see cows and sheep grazing on fields of blooming flowers.

399
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,390
You'll race on horseback and bellow with pride.

400
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,890
Mr. Ma, will perseverance lead me to these flowers?

401
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,730
You'll see grass and woods pass.

402
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,000
Will I ever reach the flowers?

403
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,520
All done.

404
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,010
Wash your hands. Get the bowls.

405
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,580
Delicious.

406
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,750
That's what I really wanted to hear.

407
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,540
Mr. Ma, you haven't answered my question. Will I ever reach the flowers?

408
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,590
Don't talk while eating.

409
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,280
Now it's time to talk about your flowery road.

410
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,170
Flowery road?

411
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,510
Flowery road!

412
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,130
Certain topics should be left for a full stomach,

413
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,150
especially when it's late at night.

414
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,490
When silence embraces us,

415
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,820
when most creatures go to sleep,

416
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,840
when you let your guard down,

417
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,350
replenishing your energy...

418
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,970
feels wonderful.

419
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll be frank with you.

420
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:20,380
You can't always find a flowery path.

421
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,620
Take my...

422
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,490
my friend as an example.

423
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,320
He was filled with arrogance,

424
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,680
thinking he could achieve anything he desired.

425
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,650
When the internet started to thrive, he undertook all kinds of jobs.

426
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,620
This lad was pretty lucky and opportunistic.

427
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,440
He always pulled out right before the recessions.

428
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,400
His wealth kept snowballing.

429
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,200
Arrogant as he was, he rented several floors

430
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,870
at the most luxurious science park in Beijing.

431
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,590
It was over 10,000 square meters.

432
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,350
He hired hundreds of employees.

433
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,250
He wanted to make it big this time.

434
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,350
So, he invested all his money to be the best.

435
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,150
He failed.

436
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,240
He lost all the money he earned over the past few years.

437
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,200
He sold his villa and his luxury car for money.

438
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,570
Thankfully, he had a conscience.

439
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,520
He paid all the wages

440
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,680
and settled all the balance payments.

441
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,280
When he did the accounts,

442
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,540
his years of effort had gone down the drain.

443
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,070
He didn't make a single penny nor was he in debt.

444
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,200
What's he doing now?

445
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,970
Nothing at all.

446
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,100
In the past, he had his sights on the world.

447
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,250
Right now, he's reflecting on himself.

448
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,720
He isolates himself from the bustling world...

449
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,120
and uses the bare energy left in him

450
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,070
to suppress his restless desire to restart his career.

451
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,310
Does he still want to be an entrepreneur?

452
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,310
Isn't that funny?

453
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:29,020
Someone else would've quit by now.

454
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,140
But him?

455
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,010
The fire... in his heart...

456
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,960
is still blazing.

457
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,700
He's reluctant to work for others.

458
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,540
All he does now is sit still.

459
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,640
I reckon he's just not interested in anything else.

460
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,650
It's the same for me.

461
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm only interested in writing,

462
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,000
but we must face reality.

463
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,090
Face reality?

464
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,660
What reality?

465
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,360
I'm a 28-year-old writer with zero popularity

466
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,930
and a pathetic number of subscribers.

467
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,810
I'm being heavily plagiarized while receiving mean comments from readers.

468
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,780
My parents doubt me,

469
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,670
and my future is bleak.

470
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,750
That's miserable.

471
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:52,320
It reminds me of the comments from my friend's parents on his career.

472
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,010
What's that?

473
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,460
"I'd rather you be a beggar than do this!"

474
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,460
For real?

475
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,210
So much for this. Let's leave this topic behind.

476
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,910
Enjoy your tea.

477
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,300
<i>[Artisan Wood Carving Workshop]</i>

478
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,890
<i>[Tiangong Workshop]</i>

479
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,740
We've made improvements to the wood carving workshop.

480
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,390
We want to boost personal branding

481
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,480
and build connections between the customers and the wood carvings.

482
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,930
It's more than a retail shop for wood carvings.

483
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,480
Our web store and short advertising videos will be our major sales channels.

484
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,050
Great.

485
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,410
I'm not good at all these, so I'll leave them in your hands.

486
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,920
- We'll do as you say.
- All right?

487
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,440
Done with the filming?

488
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,380
- Let's head outside.
- Sure.

489
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,820
Come on.

490
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,090
Xia Xia! Come over here.

491
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,880
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

492
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,900
Xia Xia, do you host live streaming too?

493
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,990
I do, but I have very few viewers.

494
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,560
It's okay. We were there once.

495
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,410
Sit down.

496
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,960
I've talked to Uncle.

497
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,950
You should continue with your live streaming.

498
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,570
In addition, Xiao Yue has also registered multiple accounts for the wood carving workshop.

499
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,470
She'll come over occasionally to make short videos.

500
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,400
She also planned a master-apprentice series for you two.

501
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,490
- You can film your master.
- Okay.

502
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,160
Wait, no. I don't want to be filmed. Why are you filming me?

503
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,230
Don't worry, Master Xie. We won't ask anything of you.

504
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,310
It'll just be footage of your daily life.

505
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,700
I'm not good with words.

506
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,280
- Xia Xia.
- A'Yao, how about this?

507
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,930
Look at this face of mine.

508
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,090
Who'd even watch me? I'm bad with words.

509
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,190
You heard her. It'll be footage of your daily life.

510
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,580
You don't have to do anything. They'll do the editing.

511
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,530
I don't want to be filmed. It's pointless.

512
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,200
Stop it! Turn it off!

513
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,360
Do you hear me? Turn that off! You...

514
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,520
Look at him. He's only interested in making videos.

515
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,460
If you had channeled this energy into wood carving,

516
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,810
your skills wouldn't be so horrible.

517
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
Master, I love you.

518
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,450
Get lost. Silly boy.

519
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,270
Stop filming! Turn it off! Look at him.

520
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,540
- Take a seat.
- Preposterous.

521
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,100
- Uncle, sit down.
- He gets sidetracked so easily.

522
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,560
Excellent!

523
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,690
I mean it! I'll edit the footage and add some text animations.

524
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,690
The theme for this master-apprentice series is "Hit Me Once More, Master"!

525
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,880
Stop laughing!

526
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,120
Get inside!

527
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,500
Send the footage to me.

528
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,410
A'Yao, have some water.

529
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,730
I need to answer this call.

530
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,130
What's up?

531
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I'm free now.

532
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,110
Yeah, sure. I'll head to you

533
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,870
I have a meeting next door.

534
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,170
Sure, go ahead.

535
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,070
Watch your step.

536
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,200
Here's our employee manual.

537
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,880
Manager Xiaochun and Chairman Xie approved it.

538
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,400
You can have a look.

539
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,210
Granny Caiyun, it's okay if you can't read it.

540
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,860
I'll explain it to you later.

541
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,590
It's very simple.

542
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,980
This manual lists instructions for new employee mentorship,

543
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,960
assessment, wages, vacations, insurance,

544
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,520
and leaving of post.

545
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,460
You have to abide by these rules.

546
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,490
There's even an attendance bonus!

547
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,780
What does that mean?

548
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,310
An attendance bonus is a monetary reward

549
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,280
if you don't show up late or leave early.

550
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,140
Granny, the attendance bonus is ¥200 per month!

551
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,700
¥200?

552
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,400
What if there's an emergency?

553
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,030
The manual states the details clearly.

554
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,500
You can ask for leave three times a month.

555
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,680
If your leave doesn't exceed three times, you can still get your attendance bonus.

556
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,230
Take leave four times or more and you'll lose it.

557
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,360
Your wage will also be deducted based on the time you leave.

558
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,580
If you want the attendance bonus,

559
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,400
you can't ask for leave like you used to.

560
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,840
Sister, the bonus attendance is ¥200.

561
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,050
We shouldn't leave as we wish.

562
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,440
That's an extra ¥200!

563
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,300
Exactly!

564
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,940
What if I leave some corn to dry in the yard and it starts to rain?

565
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,630
What should I do?

566
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,710
We can ask for leave three times a month.

567
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,230
We can take turns.

568
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,260
That's right.

569
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,430
I'm sending this manual to Ye Sen for typesetting.

570
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,680
After that, we can make an official copy and send it for printing.

571
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,460
In the future, all our employees have to stick to this manual.

572
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,500
- All right?
- Sure.

573
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,760
Make it clear to them that Manager Xu from Beijing came up with this.

574
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
Yes, I'm the bad cop.

575
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
Anyway, I won't be staying here for long.

576
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,730
In no time, I'll be gone.

577
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,700
Xu Hongdou.

578
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,050
I think I've fallin' in love with you.

579
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,410
Are you insane?

580
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,910
There, there.

581
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,690
Don't cry.

582
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,490
I'll check on them.

583
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,220
What's going on? What happened?

584
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,680
Don't cry.

585
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,150
There, there.

586
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,640
I have no clue.

587
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,880
He won't stop crying.

588
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,190
- Did he...
- His diapers are dry.

589
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,760
- Is he hungry?
- I doubt so. I just fed him.

590
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,670
My mom and aunty are shopping.

591
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm not good with babies.

592
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,060
Granny Caiyun.

593
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,970
Could you come over?

594
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,860
Is the baby crying?

595
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,480
Let me have a look.

596
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,770
I don't know what's going on.

597
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,080
What happened?

598
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,710
Why are you crying?

599
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,710
Have a seat here.

600
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,730
There, there.

601
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,730
The baby wants to sleep.

602
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,210
Granny, you're amazing with babies.

603
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,480
Brother,

604
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,280
Hongdou's lease will end in less than two months.

605
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,900
What about it?

606
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,000
What about it? I'm offering a reminder.

607
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,330
Don't fall in love with her. She'll leave.

608
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,980
Stop it. I'm not fooling around.

609
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,160
I meet Xiao Huang all the time. Why aren't you warning me about her?

610
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,330
There's no point denying it!
