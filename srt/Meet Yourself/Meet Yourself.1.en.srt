<i>Hello. Here's your keycard.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,630
Hello. Check out?

9
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,460
Could you tell me your room number, please?

10
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,430
701. Got it.

11
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,910
Okay.

12
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,669
Lisa, attend to this guest.

13
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,749
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,810
- What's your room number?
- 328.

15
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,240
Okay, come with me.

16
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,680
Helen.

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,899
Madam, are you all right?

18
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:38,909
I'm fine.

19
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,330
Be careful of the glass shards.

20
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,200
Okay.

21
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
Don't worry. I can do it.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,900
It's hard for you since you're in a short skirt.

23
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,909
- I'm really sorry.
- My apologies.

24
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,519
I'm really sorry.

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,869
The executive suites are fully booked this weekend.

26
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,839
Much as I want to, I cannot upgrade your room.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,309
How about this?

28
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,309
I'll gift you two meal tickets when you check in tomorrow.

29
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,450
I'll definitely upgrade your room next time.

30
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,900
See you tomorrow, Mr. Liu.

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,119
The receptionists must stay alert.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,510
Make sure you don't miss out on any guests when they enter.

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,020
As for the luggage deposit, double-check the luggage tags.

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,810
We have to avoid the mix-up from yesterday.

<i>Give Mommy the phone.</i>

<i>I already sent you a message two days ago.</i>

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,420
- About what?
<i>- She must've been too busy and forgotten.</i>

42
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,780
<i>- Give me the phone.</i>
- Why do I hear Mom?

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,430
Did you head back from Shanghai?

44

<i>Hongdou, it's your dad's birthday today.</i>

<i>You must've forgotten.</i>

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,700
Not at all! I was about to call you!

47
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,720
- Where's Dad?
<i>- Come over.</i>

48
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,990
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

49
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,279
I'm eating now.

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,190
Happy birthday, Dad.

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,380
<i>I told you to see a doctor for your stomach. Did you?</i>

52
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,769
I'll get a gastroscopy tomorrow. Nan Nan's coming with me.

53
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,210
She's also taking a Doppler ultrasound.

54
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,709
It's an old ailment. Don't worry.

55
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>Okay, if Nan Nan's going with you,</i>

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,400
<i>I have nothing to worry about.</i>

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,170
<i>Why do you have to head to Beijing alone?</i>

58
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,660
<i>You could've gone to Shanghai.</i>

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,360
<i>Sure. How about working as a cleaner in our company?</i>

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,679
How kind of you.

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,999
I'd rather not be a cleaner.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,190
I'll be promoted next season

63
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,239
to be the associate director of the Housekeeping Department.

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,270
Have fun celebrating Dad's birthday.

65
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,290
Lingdang, kiss me goodbye.

66
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,239
- Bye-bye.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
<i>Bye.</i>

68
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,800
<i>[I've already bought Dad a leather coat. How about you buy him an electric shaver?]</i>

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,530
Hongdou, why didn't you reply to my message?

70
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,949
I didn't get the time to reply.

71
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,360
The hot and sour soup today tastes great.

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,560
I'll get a bowl for you.

73
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,290
Cut to the chase.

74
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,559
I do have a favor to ask of you.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,920
- My good friend's younger sister is an intern at the front desk.
- Hello.

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,700
She's capable, so guide her when you have the time.

77
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,599
Manager Xu, I'm Li Meiyu.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,439
- Hi.
- Hello.

79
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,610
Are you graduating this year?

80
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,949
Do you have time after work?

81
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,309
I want to treat you to a meal.

82
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,069
Nope, I need to walk my dog.

83
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,730
You have time for a dog?

84
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,260
What about lunch tomorrow?

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,600
It's my day off tomorrow.

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,140
Hold on.

87
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,970
My VIP client is looking for me, so I'll get going.

88
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,410
Enjoy your meal.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,559
Li Meiyu, I have two tips for you.

90
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:53,159
Firstly, avoid dishes with spring onion or garlic at work.

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,400
Secondly, don't drink too much water.

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,070
- Okay.
- I'm off.

93
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Hongdou!

94
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
What's wrong?

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,970
My back has been hurting lately.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,240
You have a gastroscopy tomorrow. Can you eat now?

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,519
Yeah, I just have to avoid food and drinks after 10:00 p.m.

98
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,190
What do you want to eat?

99
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,640
- Pizza!
- Sure.

100
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,820
Did you lose weight?

101
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,039
Is it obvious?

102
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,390
Are you on a diet?

103
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,719
Not at all.

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,140
It must be the business trip.

105
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,950
On my four-day business trip,

106
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,750
I inspected two hotels.

107
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,390
That included their environment and recreational facilities.

108
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,970
After I came back, I finished a report of 20,000 words.

109
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,650
I'm exhausted.

110
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,269
Our classmate, Li Jing, even commented on my post.

111
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,580
"I'm so envious! A free trip!"

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,039
What do you want to watch?

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,620
Anything's fine.

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,310
Your rich elder sister sent you tons of bird's nests again.

115
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,460
That's from last year.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,700
Xu Hongdou!

117
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,260
It expired six months ago!

118
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,799
The chili sauce has expired, too!

119
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,720
I had it with cup noodles yesterday.

120
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,119
Is this the donkey-hide gelatin my mom made for you?

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah, I have some when I remember.

122
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,780
- What's wrong?
- Look at it yourself!

123
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,210
Why are you eating it? It's moldy!

124
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,750
I refrigerated that the moment you brought it over back then!

125
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,919
It hasn't been very long.

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,119
The last time I visited you was six months ago.

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,159
It's been that long?

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,429
Yeah.

129
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,140
We're not far off from the cowherd and the weaver fairy.

130
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,090
Even though we're both in Beijing,

131
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,550
we only meet up twice a year.

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,560
I'll help you clean your fridge after dinner.

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,770
We work so hard to make money.

134
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,730
But what for?

135
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,919
For a car!

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,620
Didn't you apply for the license lottery?

137
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,970
I won't get it in this life.

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,829
Take it easy.

139
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,900
Even if you buy a car, you'll still need the license first.

140
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,389
Besides, you'll be stuck during rush hours and frustrated from finding parking lots.

141
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,269
I used to think that I couldn't afford a house in Beijing,

142
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,120
so I might as well get a car.

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,029
Look at me now.

144
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,120
Even my simplest wish can't be fulfilled.

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,740
Forget about it then.

146
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,029
Who drove a car into a tree

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,250
when we headed home for the Chinese New Year?

148
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,969
Shut up about that and don't annoy me.

149
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,830
But that's the truth.

150
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,599
Drink less. It's bad for your stomach.

151
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,740
A little won't hurt.

152
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,410
This one is yours.

153
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,130
Delicious.

154
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,000
Look at my eyebags.

155
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,439
My eyebags appeared ages ago.

156
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,389
I even have dark eye circles and wrinkles.

157
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,000
It's the full package from staying up late.

158
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,690
Speaking of which, I'm starting to fear getting old.

159
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,029
It's time to find a boyfriend.

160
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,359
Go for it.

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,980
Didn't you say that your new colleague

162
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,359
is you type?

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,699
He's from an affluent family and he's handsome.

164
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,550
What's his name?

165
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,830

Even if we date, I'm afraid we won't last for long.

Look at you. You're all talk.

You never take action.

171

Yeah, a colleague. Poor chances though.

174
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,260
Why won't your colleague do?

175
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,880
Didn't your ex-boyfriend, Ke Ji, live too far from you?

176
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,029
One of you was in Yanjiao, and the other was in the East Fourth Ring.

177
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,810
You broke up because you met less than once a week.

So, we have to meet up.

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,900
However, meeting all the time is annoying.

182

He's just a colleague. There's no spark.

183

Life is so tough.

184
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,950
I want to retire.

Look at me.

186
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:21,740
I have no house, no car, and no boyfriend.

187

Buy a house, buy a car, and get a boyfriend.

190
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,619
Then?

191
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,910
Then, you'll be happy.

192
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,050
Will I really be happy?

193

Probably.

194
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,149
Forget it. That's too idealistic.

but you're the busy one too.

202

You've stood me up for three years.

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay.

332
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Thanks, Sister Hongdou.

333
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,699
Excuse me. Excuse me.

334
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,000
What's happening?

335
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,800
That was really loud.

336
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,000
Manager Xu!

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
Sorry.

338
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,400
This doesn't match.

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,500
<i>[Nanxing's Mom]</i>

340
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Give me a minute.

341
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,000
Hello, Aunty?

342
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm on my way.

343
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,200
Help me apply for leave.

344
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Manager Xu?

345
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,500
<i>You have stomach problems, so you should eat slowly.</i>

346
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,800
<i>Don't be negligent because you're busy.</i>

347
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,400
<i>You need balanced nutrition.</i>

348
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,300
Mister, you dropped a gear.

349
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't need it anymore. It's chipped.

350
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,400
The gear is worn out after longterm use.

351
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,600
The clock won't be precise with it.

352
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I'm swapping it out with a new one.

353
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,400
You can leave after taking the IV drip.

354
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,600
Doctor, am I dying?

355
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,000
I've given you an examination. You're fine.

356
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You fainted, so it might be a little shocking.

357
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,500
It's just temporary ischemia and hypoxia

358
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,800
due to excessive stress or anxiety.

359
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Just relax.

360
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't be too anxious.

361
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
So, I'm not ill?

362
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
You're suffering from slight anemia and malnutrition.

363
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,300
You need iron supplements. Be sure to eat on time.

364
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,100
Have more eggs and meat. Don't skip meals just to diet.

365
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,800
- Thank you, Doctor.
- No problem.

366
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
You're free to go after taking the IV drip.

367
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Okay.

368
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,300
Manager Xu, I've paid the bills.

369
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,800
I'll leave the receipt here.

370
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,200
Okay.

371
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Thank you.

372
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
I... I have something urgent to attend to.

373
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
It's my boyfriend's birthday today.

374
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,800
He flew over from Guangzhou to meet me.

375
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Hurry over to him. I'm fine.

376
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,400
I... I'll wait until your IV drip is done.

377
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,700
I'm feeling fine. You can go.

378
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,800
Don't make him wait.

379
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Okay, I-I'll head off.

380
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,100
Manager Xu, call me immediately if you need anything.

381
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,600
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

382
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,500
<i>Hongdou.</i>

383
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,800
<i>I don't know how to say this to you in person.</i>

384
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,300
<i>So, I'm sorry about this.</i>

385
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,500
<i>I have to speak to you like this.</i>

386
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,300
<i>You won't get a chance to answer me.</i>

387
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,700
<i>This might just be my last words.</i>

388
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,100
<i>When I'm gone,</i>

389
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,400
<i>I think my parents will be the most miserable.</i>

390
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,500
<i>Please give them a call during the holidays.</i>

391
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
<i>Check in on them for me.</i>

392
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,700
<i>A call is enough.</i>

393
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,000
<i>There's no need for anything else.</i>

394
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,600
<i>I know the two of them...</i>

395
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>will never ask others for favors.</i>

396
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,200
<i>I'm sure they'll be ecstatic just to receive a call from you.</i>

397
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
<i>When I'm gone,</i>

398
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
<i>don't drown in sadness for too long.</i>

399
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
<i>Cry for a bit</i>

400
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
<i>and show that you're upset.</i>

401
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
<i>That's enough.</i>

402
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600
<i>Anyway, I didn't do anything evil</i>

403
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
<i>in this life.</i>

404
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,400
<i>Right?</i>

405
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,200
<i>I'll go to a great place after death.</i>

406
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,600
<i>Don't worry.</i>

407
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,800
<i>Besides, I won't feel pain by then.</i>

408
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
<i>I'll be free.</i>

409
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>You should be happy for me.</i>

410
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,100
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

411
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,000
<i>Actually, I really regret this.</i>

412
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,900
<i>Why didn't I confess my feelings to Sun Zhixin?</i>

413
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,000
<i>When it comes to romance,</i>

414
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,700
<i>one more day of happiness counts.</i>

415
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
<i>Isn't that so?</i>

416
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,500
<i>Right now,</i>

417
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
<i>there's still a world that I yearn to see...</i>

418
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,300
<i>but can no longer do so.</i>

419
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,600
<i>I'll leave this to you.</i>

420
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,300
<i>All the food, drinks, and experiences I want to try.</i>

421
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,300
<i>Everything I can't do.</i>

422
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,600
<i>I'll let you</i>

423
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,400
<i>eat, drink, and experience on my behalf.</i>

424
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,600
<i>But listen up.</i>

425
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,600
<i>Make sure to check the expiry dates before you eat anything.</i>

426
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,400
<i>Don't stuff everything into the fridge</i>

427
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
<i>and forget about them.</i>

428
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>One more thing.</i>

429
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,200
<i>You have to take proper meals.</i>

430
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,999
<i>Sleep well.</i>

431
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,100
<i>Live a good life.</i>

432
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,700
<i>You have to be happy.</i>

433
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
<i>You have to go out more often.</i>

434
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,200
<i>Open your heart to others.</i>

435

<i>take my place.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

440
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>If you meet someone you fancy,</i>

442

<i>Don't wait for others to woo you</i>

443

<i>The more the better.</i>

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400

<i>That's all for now.</i>

459

<i>If I think of more,</i>

461
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
<i>I'll add on to this.</i>

462

<i>All right, that's it.</i>

466

<i>I can probably march on for another 500 years.</i>

<i>Can you believe that?</i>

472
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
<i>Will you drop by after work?</i>

473

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
Yeah, Mom.

492
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
I got three months of paid leave.

493
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,600
I haven't taken any vacation for years.

494
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
I won't go home for now.

495
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,600
I want to spend a few months in Yunnan

496
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,500
and take a breather.

497
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,600
I want to travel.

498
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,500
♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫

499
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,800
♫ <i>Enjoy the mountainous landscape at sunset</i> ♫

500
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,400
♫ <i>The raindrops from the roof drip into my eyes quietly</i> ♫

501
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,000
♫ <i>The world is like a quiet island</i> ♫

502
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,300
♫ <i>The sky is turning bright without a sound</i> ♫

503
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,200
♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

504
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,800
♫ <i>Waiting for a ray of sunlight to shine across
the lake into my heart</i> ♫

505
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,800
♫ <i>Set sail when it's windy</i> ♫

506
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,600
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,
and the starry sky</i> ♫

507
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,800
♫ <i>Disoriented footsteps will gradually be erased</i> ♫

508
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

509
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,400
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

510
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,500
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

511
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,000
♫ <i>The sky is turning bright without a sound</i> ♫

512
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,200
♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

513
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,599
♫ <i>Waiting for a ray of sunlight to shine across
the lake into my heart</i> ♫

514
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,210
♫ <i>Set sail when it's windy</i> ♫

515
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,400
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,
and the starry sky</i> ♫

516
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,100
♫ <i>Disoriented footsteps will gradually be erased</i> ♫

517
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,599
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

518
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,200
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

519
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,500
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

520
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:43,100
♫ <i>I'll head to a windy place to meet you</i> ♫
