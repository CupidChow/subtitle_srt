3
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,899
Hey, do you need help?

4
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
No, thanks.

5
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,760
Stop!

6
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,580
Sorry! I'm sorry!

7
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,540
Stop right there!

8
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,140
This is the place.

9
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,179
Thank you, kiddo.

10
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,699
- Are you going to live here?
- That's right.

11
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,480
Well, do you know Xiao Hu Lu's mom?

12
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,740
Who's Xiao Hu Lu?

13
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,800
Tuotuo!

14
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,879
She's Xiao Hu Lu.

15
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,079
We're going to play at Guobao's home! Are you coming?

16
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,540
I am! Wait for me!

17
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,220
Off you go.

18
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,260
Be careful.

19
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,740
Is anyone in?

20
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,280
Hello.

21
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
Do you know Xie Xiaochun...

22
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,920
Hello.

23
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,220
Hello! Are you Xu Hongdou?

24
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,579
Are you Xie Xiaochun?

25
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,180
Why did you come over by yourself?

26
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,959
It's about time you arrived, but you didn't call me.

27
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,500
I tried calling you, but nobody picked up either.

28
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,740
Was it hard to get here?

29
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,040
My phone's broken.

30
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,079
Oh, I see. Is that your luggage?

31
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,319
- Yes.
- I'll help you carry it over.

32
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,720
Don't worry! I can do it myself!

33
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,919
Oh, let me do it. You've been hauling it around for the whole day.

34
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,019
- It's heavy.
- Yeah, it's a little heavy.

35
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,139
All right. One, two, three.

36
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,360
Nice.

37
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,900
Let's go.

38
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,400
Our yard is pretty large, isn't it?

39
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah, it is.

40
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,379
This isn't just one homestead.

41
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,539
It's made up of three homesteads.

42
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,720
Two years ago, we rented the place and renovated it.

43
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,779
Then, we turned it into a homestay.

44
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,600
There are six rooms here.

45
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,220
Here's your room.

46
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,019
The resident of Room Five rented the place for five months and just checked out.

47
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,759
There's no one staying in there for now.

48
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,939
However, the other rooms are occupied.

49
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,200
If you want a rental renewal after three months,

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
let me know two weeks in advance.

51
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
Okay.

52
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,800
Have a look.

53
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,860
Here you go.

54
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,619
These are the parcels you sent over.

55
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,579
I've collected them for you.

56
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,099
- Check through them.
- Okay. Thank you.

57
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,799
Come on, Hongdou. I'll show you around quickly.

58
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,939
Here's our shared kitchen.

59
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,880
You can use all the appliances and cooking facilities here. Everything is shared.

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,279
There's a tearoom over there.

61
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,080
Behind the tearoom, there's a utility room and a tool shed.

62
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,060
- It's pretty nice.
- Let's take a look inside.

63
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,300
Here's our dining room.

64
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,160
There's a rest area at the back.

65
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,439
If I'm not around,

66
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,080
feel free to ask Nana about anything.

67
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
She's in Room One.

68
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,260
Right now, she's at the cafe.

69
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,920
I'll introduce her to you later.

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,700
Okay.

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,620
Who's he?

72
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,920
He lives in Room Two. You can ignore him.

73
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,119
That's more or less it.

74
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
- I'll get going now.
- Thank you, Xiaochun.

76
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,340
You're welcome.

77
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,080
Oh, a boy was running after a horse in the town.

78
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,220
He ran off after he knocked my phone out of my hands.

79
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,360
Running after a horse?

80
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
What does he look like?

81
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,400
He's quite young, tall, and lean.

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,359
I see. You've come to the right person.

83
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,399
He lives in the vicinity. Right down the next alley.

84
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,620
I'll bring you over.

85
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,840
- Thank you, Xiaochun.
- It's nothing. Let's go.

86
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,999
- Be careful.
- Okay.

87
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,240
We're here.

88
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,660
Come on, Hongdou.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,119
He lives here.

90
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,940
He has a grandmother and an elder brother.

91
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Give me a minute.

92
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,940
Hello?

93
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,879
Okay, I got it. I'll be right back.

94
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,240
Okay.

95
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,419
Hongdou. I won't go in with you. My shop needs me.

96
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,179
Head in and look for his brother.

97
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,679
Okay. Thank you so much.

98
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,239
- I can handle this alone.
- Okay.

99
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,059
If you have the time tomorrow, I'll treat you to coffee at my shop.

100
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,320
Okay.

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,419
- I'm off.
- Okay.

102
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,900
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

103
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,580
We have so many horses. Why do you have to ride Cutie Pie?

104
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,719
The cut on your leg from being thrown off just healed!

105
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,399
This time, you let it run off.

106
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,780
Luckily, no one was trampled over.

107
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,720
Otherwise, I'd break your damn legs.

108
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Did I say you can eat?

109
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,160
Has Granny even started eating?

110
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,379
Cut your hair, too. You look horrible.

111
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,180
Hey, this style makes me handsome!

112
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,460
Cut your hair!

113
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,760
Granny! Look at him!

114
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Sit down and eat.

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,820
Excuse me.

116
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,400
You don't have a doorbell, so I came in.

117
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,479
You must be a tourist. Are you lost?

118
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm looking for him.

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,180
Me?

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,000
He bumped into me this morning while chasing his horse.

121
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,639
The horse knocked into someone?

122
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,279
No! It didn't!

123
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,560
The horse didn't bump into me.

124
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,080
He knocked into me while chasing the horse.

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,999
Then, my phone flew out of my hands. It's broken now.

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
Is your phone broken?

127
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,120
You didn't say a word about bumping into her.

128
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,659
Now, she's come knocking.

129
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,639
You troublemaker! All you bring are problems!

130
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,579
- Brother!
- Troublemaker!

131
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,520
- Don't hit me!
- I'm sorry!

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,539
- Don't run!
- Don't hit me!

133
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:57,939
- Stand still! Don't move!
- I'm so sorry!

134
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:00,179
Spare me, Brother!

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,040
Don't hit me!

136
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,660
- Stop there!
- Spare me!

137
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,139
Granny! Help me!

138
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,700
Granny!

139
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,520
The screen is shattered and it can't be turned on.

140
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,759
Do you want the screen fixed or a new phone?

141
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,079
Just fix the screen.

142
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,719
I have important information in it.

143
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,520
If it can't be fixed, just pay me half the price.

144
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,020
After all, I've used it for over a year.

145
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,059
It can only be fixed in the Old Town, not in the village.

146
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,219
How long are you staying here?

147
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll be here for some time.

148
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,240
He knocked into me on my first day here.

149
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
Who brought you here?

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,220
- Xie Xiaochun.
- Xiaochun?

151
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,280
- Are you living in Youfeng Courtyard?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,660
My name is Xie Zhiyao. What's your name?

153
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,620
Xu Hongdou.

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,819
I'm busy later, so I can't bring you to fix your phone. I'll get someone to bring you there.

155
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,259
It's fine. I have to tidy my room.

156
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,659
Tomorrow, I can head over alone.

157
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,719
I'll hand you the receipt after that. How about that?

158
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:10,040
That works. Sorry about this.

159
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,099
Don't worry.

160
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,840
Hold on.

161
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,120
Xie Zhiyuan! Come here.

162
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,680
Apologize to her.

163
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
Sorry.

164
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,220
- Be sincere.
- I'm sorry!

165
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,999
Don't force him. It's fine. I forgive him.

166
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:35,919
We're really sorry.

167
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,679
- Don't worry.
- Sorry!

168
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't beat him.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,180
I... I won't.

170
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,660
Did I beat you?

171
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
Granny!

172
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,240
He grabbed my neck and kicked me in the butt!

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,840
Look at this!

174
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,239
You're fine.

175
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,380
It hurts like hell.

176
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,439
What did that pretty lady say?

177
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,960
She said we can try fixing it. If it can't be fixed, we just have to pay half the price.

178
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,200
After all, she's used it for over a year.

179
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
She's an honest girl.

180
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,339
Exactly. She didn't even ask for a new phone.

181
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:11,239
He doesn't even buy me a new phone.

182
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,959
I'm using his old phone.

183
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,159
What a miser.

184
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,900
Why does a student need a new phone?

185
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,179
It lags when I play games. Everyone's snapping at me.

186
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,699
Don't play with people who snap at you. That's so rude.

187
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,100
Granny, you don't understand.

188
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
Wait!

189
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Don't bully him.

190
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,140
Eat up.

191
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
Hello, how is it? Any updates on the wood carving displays?

192
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,080
How can machines be the same as handmade crafts?

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,439
Machines use molds.

194
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,279
A flat boxwood produces nothing unique.

195
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,620
Is this the result of your discussions?

196
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,519
Try harder.

197
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,360
Can't we eat in peace?

198
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,580
Granny, eat up.

199
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Granny Xiuying. Clean up the horse dung at the entrance.

200
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,060
Sister, you forgot to clean up the horse dung again.

201
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,800
I... I forgot.

202
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Forget it. I'll clean it up.

203
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,100
Sister Xiaochun, is she here?

204
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,079
Yeah. She looks rather amicable.

205
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,880
What's her name and her job?

206
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,139
She's called Xu Hongdou.

207
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,680
I didn't ask about her job yet.

208
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,620
Haven't you had lunch?

209
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,619
Damai and I tried to make steamed buns last night.

210
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,160
I'll take a few to Xia Xia.

211
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,259
Don't bother with him.

212
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,240
It's no big deal.

213
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,180
Take a look!

214
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,679
- Look!
- Yingzi.

215
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,300
<i>What the hell are you even doing every day?</i>

216
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,799
- Look!
- What's up with Xia Xia this time?

217
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,200
His master has been scolding him for some time.

218
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,420
He thinks Xia Xia is a loafer.

219
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,980
Look! Did I teach you to do this?

220
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,659
Do you think you're a professional after a few years under my guidance?

221
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,940
Do you think you can fool around because you're all that now?

222
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,359
I'm trying to be creative.

223
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:07,460
Creative? With your skills?

224
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,599
Listen up!

225
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:14,460
When I was your age, people were fighting to hire me!

226
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,200
Look at your door!

227
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,460
How many days have you been working on it?

228
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,480
Look at the flower!

229
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,500
Are you sure you're awake?

230
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,060
I haven't finished carving it.

231
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,400
Sloppy!

232
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,880
Impatient!

233
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,339
All you do is surf the internet with your phone and laugh like a fool!

234
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,440
You're not even focused on this!

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,720
How can you learn to fly when you're still crawling?

236
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,360
Master, I'm sorry.

237
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,280
You're insanely polite when apologizing,

238
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,700
but you never repent!

239
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,880
Why are you glaring at me?

240
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,079
Master, I'll be frank with you. Keep calm.

241
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,120
Be frank?

242
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,200
So, you've only lied to me?

243
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,860
Fine. Go ahead.

244
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,640
Talk.

245
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,560
Spit it out!

246
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,580
If your wood carvings can be sold, I promise to focus.

247
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,139
You're a craftsman with decades of experience

248
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,120
and a municipal inheritor of intangible cultural heritage.

249
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,279
Your root carving has been sitting here for two years.

250
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,200
It's going to become a household spirit soon.

251
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,040
There's also the chair outside.

252
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,119
Everyone touches it, but nobody buys it.

253
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
But tons of people come to take a look.

254
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,420
As long as our skills are good—

255
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,540
It's uselees. People only come to take photos.

256
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,360
We should be thankful if they're willing to buy a trinket.

257
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,159
You carve items, and the other craftsmen in the village send their carvings over, too.

258
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,139
It's hard to sell all this stuff.

259
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,059
I reckon you shouldn't even have set up a wood carvings shop.

260
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,079
Online retail is the same, but with a lot fewer costs.

261
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,139
- You...
- Xia Xia!

262
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,460
Uncle, you're here, too.

263
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,300
He's so old, but he's still so hot-tempered.

264
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,940
No wonder he's furious.

265
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,480
Even I think you're lazy.

266
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,599
His pent-up anger makes him pissed off at everything.

267
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,620
Aren't you to blame for his anger?

268
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,619
It's not my fault. It was a junior apprentice.

269
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,860
Forget it. It's not worth talking about.

270
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,040
What do you mean?

271
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,399
It's pointless for me to stay here. Don't you think so?

272
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,460
I don't agree.

273
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,660
How is this place better than Shanghai?

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,200
This place has its own charms, and so does Shanghai.

275
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,220
Don't kid me.

276
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,260
Why haven't you had lunch at this time?

277
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,640
Your favorite soy milk.

278
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,300

I think I'll pay by card.

330
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
We don't have that here.

331
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
It's only payment by phone.

332
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,800
Is there an ATM around here?

333
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Nope.

334
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
Miss, it's fine.

335
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Let me treat you to a meal this time.

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,700
- No, that won't do.
- You can go. Don't worry.

337
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,100
Do you know about Youfeng Courtyard?

338
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,400
I do. Do you live there?

339
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
I just arrived here and broke my phone.

340
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I'll be staying there for a few months.

341
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll pay you back when I withdraw some money tomorrow.

342
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
All right. It's not a big deal.

343
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,800
How about I leave my camera here first?

344
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
There's no need for that! Miss, don't do this.

345
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,800
You can leave. Don't worry.

346
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I promise to bring the money over.

347
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,500
- Okay. Take care.
- Thank you.

348
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,300
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

The TV station will film the embroidery workshop tomorrow.

362
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Xiaoyue will be in charge of this.

363
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
- I'll send the production team's contact details to you later.
- Okay.

364
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,500
President Xie, we've asked logistics to come over tomorrow morning.

365
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,600
All embroideries and retail goods for Xinjiang's intangible cultural heritage exhibition

366
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,100
will be packed and transported tomorrow.

367
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm letting you know first.

368
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Can logistics come over a little later?

369
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Ms. Xie's "Seven Galloping Horses" embroidery is meant for the exhibition, but I want the TV station to film it.

370
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay, I'll let them know.

371
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,000
When will you and Zhang Xiaolan go to Xinjiang?

372
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
Gezi and I will head over the day after tomorrow.

373
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Ms. Zhang and her students can head over next week.

374
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,500
Okay.

375
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,700
Let's go with his for now.

376
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
Ye Sen, where are the walnuts?

377
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Over here.

378
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
Let everyone have a taste.

379
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,700
Uncle.

380
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
- You're here.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
Come on.

382
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,200
Have a taste.

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Here you go.

384
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,100
Daxia, try some.

385
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,400
Were these from other provinces?

386
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
Huang Xinxin from our village has a contact.

387
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
Her friend's village specializes in walnuts.

388
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,700
She wants us to help sell these.

389
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,800
What do you think?

390
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
Not bad.

391
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Crunchy. Satisfying.

392
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,800
But we need to check out the production site.

393
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
No problem.

394
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,300
Uncle.

395
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,800
- Mr. Xie.
- Mr. Xie, you're here!

396
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,100
Uncle, please have some tea.

397
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,500
Okay.

398
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
A'Yao.

399
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm here to ask you about the hotel's commission

400
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,800
for wood carvings.

401
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,700
I wanted to speak to you after things have been settled.

402
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,000
Here's the thing.

403
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,800
My designer friend told me that the art hotel's owner

404
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,400
wanted to hang a wood carving display

405
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,200
at the vestibule of each floor.

406
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,000
But, right now...

407
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,500
He wants to hang a large wood carving display in the hotel's main lobby.

408
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,200
He wants you to carve it personally.

409
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,400
The other areas will have wood carvings by machines.

410
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,900
This is so he can cut costs.

411
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,800
So, he only needs one?

412
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Can others carve it?

413
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
You're the inheritor of intangible cultural heritage.

414
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,200
It has to be your work.

415
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,400
My apprentices are pretty skilled as well.

416
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,300
In the past when everyone was constructing houses,

417
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,500
- people had to wait in line for my apprentices.
- I know.

418
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,800
Uncle, this hasn't been confirmed yet.

419
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll ask my friend to make an appointment with the owner.

420
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,200
I'll try to negotiate this deal again.

421
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
Forget it.

422
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,300
Don't negotiate any further.

423
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,400
I don't want to beg others for this.

424
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Just tell him this.

425
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,000
This... Ask him to find someone else for the large wood carving as well.

426
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
I don't need this deal.

427
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Hey, you aren't begging him.

428
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,100
Profit requires negotiations.

429
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,100
We come to an agreement when the client's price matches our services.

430
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,500
I, Xie Heshun, have never begged others for profit.

431
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,000
My skills bring in the cash.

432
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
I've never begged others for work.

433
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
A'Yao, I'm not scolding you.

434
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,900
Don't be angry.

435
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Don't waste your effort on this.

436
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm leaving.

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Don't rush off.

438
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,400
Forget it. Bye.

439
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,000
Excuse me!

440
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
Can I ask for directions?

441
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,100
Why did you come all the way here?

442
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,800
I'm just taking a stroll.

443
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,300
Well, so we meet again.

444
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,000
It's easy to meet in this small place.

445
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,100
Are you going back to the courtyard?

446
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
Walk down this road to the seaside.

447
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,300
After that, go along the highway by the sea.

448
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,000
You'll see the village entrance.

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Okay! Thank you!

450
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
What's wrong?

451
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,400
Were you bitten by a snake?

452
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,600
Why are you glowering at it?

453
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,700
Haven't you seen it before?

454
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
I've never stepped in it before.

455
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,800
How about removing your foot from the cow dung first?

456
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,600
First time riding a horse?

457
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
Yes.

458
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
Don't worry.

459
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Cutie Pie is very docile.

460
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,100
A'Yuan hurled firecrackers at it before.

461
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,200
That's why it doesn't like him.

462
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
It's called Cutie Pie?

463
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,800
It was a tiny foal and really adorable.

464
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
Thank you.

465
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,400
It's no big deal.

466
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,800
Stepping in cow dung is an auspicious sign.

467
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,600
Maybe I'll share some of your good luck, too.

468
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,900
Did you quit your job to travel?

469
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
How did you know?

470
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,900
You're staying here for three months straight.

471
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
No company would permit such a long break.

472
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
How did you know I'll be here for three months?

473
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Youfeng Courtyard requires a minimum rental of three months.

474
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
You're right.

475
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you heartbroken or lost?

476
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Why do you ask that?

477
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,600
It has to be between love or career.

478
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,600
Youngsters in the city are all the same.

479
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,500
They think they're suffering from enormous pressure.

480
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,100
They work more than they earn.

481
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,500
Their bosses are also fools.

482
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Even though they complain every day, only a handful resign.

483
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
Do you know why?

484
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Why?

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's because they need to find a job after they resign.

486
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
Without a job, they have no mney.

487
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Without money, they can't stay alive.

488
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Well... Can rearing horses support your family?

489
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,800
Yes. We have a house and land with low expenses.

490
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,200
Granny grows vegetables and sells her harvest at her stall daily.

491
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
She can earn enough money.

492
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Even if I do nothing, Granny's money can keep us fed.

493
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,200
How old is she?

494
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
She's turning 80 this year.

495
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
The sun is setting!

496
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,200
♫ <i>Sunset glow flushes the sky</i> ♫

497
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,500
♫ <i>The sea confronts the wind</i> ♫

498
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
♫ <i>The sunset is so gentle</i> ♫

499
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,400
♫ <i>The mountains hide behind the clouds</i> ♫

500
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,800
♫ <i>A dream is unfolding</i> ♫

501
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,400
♫ <i>Rendezvous with the stars</i> ♫

502
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:07,000
♫ <i>When the night breeze brings away a temporary eternity</i> ♫

503
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,900
♫ <i>And busy daytime</i> ♫

504
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,400
♫ <i>I close my eyes and find a reason to breathe</i> ♫

505
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,400
♫ <i>My hand finds yours</i> ♫

506
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,000
♫ <i>At the end of the world</i> ♫

507
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,100
♫ <i>Everything has been left behind</i>

508
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
- Here you go. Take care.
- Thank you.

509
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,600
Be careful.

510
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Sit over there.

511
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Xiao Qin, get me a pair of slippers.

512
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Brother A'Yao! Is she your girlfriend?

513
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,800
Are you kidding?

514
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,500
She's just a tourist.

515
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
How can you let her ride Cutie Pie so easily?

516
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,900
You didn't even let me ride it when I wanted to.

517
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,700
Pick a pair.

518
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,200
This one.

519
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Does it fit?

520
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
Yeah. How much is it?

521
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,400
You came with him, so I won't inflate the price.

522
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Just ¥25.

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
¥10.

524
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,600
I really can't earn a cent if I charge ¥10!

525
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,400
Fine, ¥10.

526
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,300
Why are you paying for them?

527
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,600
She...

528
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,500
Are you a global police? Why are you so nosy?

529
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
I'll remove the tag for you.

530
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,800
Okay.

531
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,400
Brother A'Yao!

532
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't be rude!

533
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
In terms of seniority, you should be calling me Uncle A'Yao

534
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Uncle? We're living in the modern world.

535
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,200
Why are you still harping on seniority?

536
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Besides, we aren't even relatives.

537
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Your slippers.

538
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,400
See you.

539
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,500
Hold on. You can have this.

540
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Thank you so much.

541
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Come and visit when you have the time!

542
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,100
Bye-bye.

543
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,200
Brother A'Yao! I'll visit your house tomorrow!

544
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Fine.

545
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,000
- Brother! Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

546
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,500
- Did you just come back?
- Yeah.

547
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,400
Where are you going?

548
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm picking Granny up for dinner.

549
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
I see. Take care.

550
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,000
Are these slippers hard to walk in?

551
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
Guanjun.

552
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Granny.

553
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Don't embroider in the dark. You'll spoil your eyes.

554
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
Why are you back so late?

555
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,900
She's been waiting for ages.

556
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Is she your friend?

557
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,000
A new tenant in the courtyard, Xu Hongdou.

558
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Hello.

559
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
So, you'll be here for quite some time.

560
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,300
I set up shop at 6:00 p.m. every evening.

561
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,800
Come over if you're craving barbecue.

562
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay.

563
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll help you hold the horse's reins.

564
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,700
Okay.

565
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,400
It's very docile. It won't kick you.

566
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,000
Let me do it.

567
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
- Here, have some.
- It's fine.

568
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,300
Don't worry. Have a bite.

569
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,700
Thank you.

570
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,800
Let's go.

571
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't really know how to lead a horse.

572
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,300
You don't have to know a thing. Just hold on to the reins.

573
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,000
If it's really beyond you, let Granny do it.

574
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,800
Come on.

575
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
It's okay. I can do it.

576
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,500
Let's go.

577
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,000
How much did you earn today?

578
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,100
Over ¥100.

579
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,800
That much?

580
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Beef and mutton ribs!

581
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
Okay.

582
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,200
Granny, let me wash it.

583
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Don't worry.

584
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Go and have some tea. Shoo.

585
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Hurry up. Have some tea.

586
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,900
Xu Hongdou! Help me bring out the dishes!

587
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,600
Okay.

588
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,700
These are just some homecooked dishes. Don't hold back.

589
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Thank you. Don't we have to wait for your brother?

590
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Who cares about him? He's probably fooling around somewhere.

591
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,200
A'Yao.

592
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,800
Aunty Baoping! We're in the house!

593
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,800
Our neighbor.

594
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Aunty.

595
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
My relative is having a wedding, so I stewed some beef.

596
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,200
I brought some over for you.

597
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,000
Beef! Amazing!

598
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,500
We have a guest, but we're lacking a decent dish.

599
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

600
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,100
The new tenant at the courtyard.

601
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,300
Baoping, join us if you haven't eaten yet.

602
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
I have food back at home.

603
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
Xiaochun went to call Xiao Hu Lu back.

604
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,900
I'll eat once I'm home.

605
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,000
- Try it while it's still hot.
- Wow.

606
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Thank you.

607
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,600
Enjoy your meal.

608
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I'll head off.

609
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,500
Thank you, Aunty.

610
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,600
Aunty, I'm leaving.

611
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,400
Aunty Baoping, let me see you off.

612
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,100
Try some. Don't wait for him.

613
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Thank you.

614
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,700
Aunty Baoping, is something bothering you?

615
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,500
I was hoping you could persuade Xia Xia.

616
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,600
Well... He's rather flighty now and sloppy with his work.

617
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,000
Today, he angered his master again.

618
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,900
He refused to listen to his sister

619
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,200
and they started another quarrel at home.

620
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
Don't blame youngsters for being fidgety.

621
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,600
Everyone loves to have fun.

622
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,700
Uncle can berate him, but you guys shouldn't scold him.

623
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,400
I know. But this time is different.

624
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,600
He told me he has a friend in Shanghai who invited him over.

625
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,100
So, he wants to take a trip to Shanghai.

626
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
When did he have such a friend?

627
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't know.

628
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,100
He's watching videos and chatting on his phone every day.

629
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm not forbidding him from traveling,

630
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,200
but I'm afraid he won't come back once he leaves.

631
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,600
Did Xia Xia say this?

632
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,100
He didn't, but I know him well.

633
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,800
A while back, he told me his master's latest apprentice

634
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
wants to quit and leave.

635
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,600
Another apprentice wants to quit?

636
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes.

637
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,700
Doors and windows are carved by machines now.

638
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,300
Even senior craftsmen in the village barely have jobs.

639
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,600
That's why apprentices are leaving.

640
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,800
The rest are growing jittery.

641
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,600
All right, I got it.

642
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Aunty Baoping, don't be anxious.

643
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll discuss it with Xiaochun first and then ask Xia Xia.

644
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,200
Sorry for troubling you again.

645
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,000
- It's no big deal.
- I'm off.

646
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Don't forget about tomorrow as well.

647
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,200
I won't.

648
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,800
Great. I'll head off.

649
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,100
Enjoy your meal.

650
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,400
- Be careful.
- Okay.

651
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
Take care!

652
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,000
Don't say that. I'm just telling you guys that my phone is broken.

653
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
I was eating at a friend's house.

654
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,800
Mom, my break starts tomorrow.

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,900
I'll rest and won't do much.

656
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,200
Mom, I have to hang up.

657
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,400
I need to return the phone.

658
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,300
That's all. Bye-bye.

659
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,600
Come on, I'll send you back.

660
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,000
Don't worry. It's really close by.

661
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,200
I can head back myself.

662
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Do you have any cash?

663
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,400
Nope.

664
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Take this. For emergencies.

665
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,200
Thank you. I'll pay you back.

666
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,000
We can deal with that after your phone is fixed.

667
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Let's go.

668
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,500
I need to go to Galsang Flower Restaurant.

669
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,400
Are you still hungry?

670
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,000
No, my lunch was on credit.

671
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm going to pay them.

672
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,200
It's no hurry, right?

673
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I'll only be at ease after paying the bill.

674
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,600
Fine.

675
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Be careful. There's a step.

676
