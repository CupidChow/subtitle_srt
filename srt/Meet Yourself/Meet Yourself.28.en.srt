The things we usually can't find pop up once we start packing.

4
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,150
Exactly. I can't find them when I want to use them.

5
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,841
Look! A dozen nail clippers.

6
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,680
We even have these old mobile phones. Look.

7
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,020
We can't throw these away.

8
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,280
But... what's the use of them? They're so old.

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,590
- We can keep them as a memory. These things...
- Mom!

10
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,766
Come over here.

11
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,920
- Take a look at this.
- Throw away whatever seems useless. There's no need to ask me.

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,810
Hold on. What are you throwing away? Let me check.

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,744
It's so dusty.

14
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,810
Grandma bought this fan for me when I was in elementary school, right?

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,270
Why do we still have this? It's been over 20 years. I'm sure it's broken.

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,842
Dou, you should really throw this away.

17
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:11,406
Why are you wiping it?

18
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,180
I'll check if it can still work.

19
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,246
Don't try it. I bet it's broken.

20
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,410
Look.

21
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,020
Look. The quality of older products is much better.

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,100
It can still work.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,090
Her grandma reared over 30 chickens just to buy her this.

24
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,918
She sold their eggs and saved over ¥100 for this.

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,060
<i>Is it cooling?</i>

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,880
All right. It's too old for our new house.

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,310
Let's not keep it.

28
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,894
I'll keep it.

29
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,850
It's Grandma's wind.

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,630
Grandma's wind?

31
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,838
Your grandma would be exasperated if she knew about this.

32
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,150
This is Secretary Li of Yunmiao Village.

33

This is the village director.

Chairman Xie, we meet again.

43
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,380
Why don't I see Hongdou?

44
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,570
She's not here.

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,250
Where is she?

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,400
Look at him. He only remembers beautiful women.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,180
A'Yao, let me formally introduce him to you.

48
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,432
In fact, Xiao Zhang is our chief designer and one of our partners.

49
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,180
Chief designer and partner?

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,260
You're so young!

51
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,431
Last time, I joined Brother Liu and his wife on their trip.

52
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,950
I was afraid of bothering you, so I said I was their assistant.

53
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,080
So sweet. It's no trouble at all.

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,750
A'Yao, I've already introduced Chief Designer Zhang to you.

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,930
I'll introduce the entire team to you later.

56
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,120
Great!

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,910
Today, the village has made arrangements. I'm just helping out. All right?

Is that some kind of tactic?

When I was in Yunnan, that's the village I stayed in.

84
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,289
A homestay has been built there.

85
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,950
The village is also in development.

86
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,314
If the owner hadn't fallen ill, it wouldn't have been sold.

87

I think your homestays are doing quite well,

88

I was wondering if you'd consider expanding branches.

<i>It's better to be your own boss.</i>

<i>Is there a better job offer?</i>

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,144
A friend invited me to join their Staff Training Department.

96
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:08,783
<i>Is the salary lower than your reception post?</i>

97
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,111
Yes. The benefit is the regular working hours.

98
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,210
I'm not really thinking about starting a business.

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,078
After all, starting one requires quite a sum of money. Right?

100
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,650
<i>You're not wrong in thinking so.</i>

101

<i>It's secure to work as an employee for a stable salary.</i>

<i>Mr. Hu was on the scooter with Sister Manjun.</i>

174
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,648
<i>They accidentally fell into the field.</i>

175
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,986
<i>Does she like Mr. Hu?</i>

176
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,970
No way. Sister Manjun's daughter is already in college.

177
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,930
She has such a grown daughter?

178
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,198
She doesn't look like she does!

179
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,930
Sister Manjun said that she didn't want to hinder her child's college entrance examinations,

180
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,626
so she filed for divorce only after that.

181
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:26,290
<i>But does her daughter being in college</i>

182
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,722
affect her potential feelings for Mr. Hu?

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,980
Nope.

184
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,236
At first glance, Mr. Hu is poor, ugly, and sleazy.

185
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,240
<i>Sister Manjun is rich, beautiful, and elegant.</i>

186
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,120
<i>No one would think of them as a couple.</i>

187
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,266
It's unlike how Hongdou and Chairman Xie seem so compatible.

188
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,220
We're compatible?

189
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,570
Get married!

190
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,030
<i>Stop that.</i>

191
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,838
It's a bad ending for them.

192
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,402
I don't like this ending.

193
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,770
If readers ask you to change the ending,

194
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,940
will you do it?

195
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,780
<i>She won't.</i>

196
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Will you?

197
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,500
<i>Dou, the moving truck is here. Come on.</i>

198
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,610
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Okay.

199
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,530
The moving truck is here. I have to go.

200
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,750
- I'm hanging up.
- Bye-bye.

201
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,920
Good luck with the move.

202
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,221
Okay, bye-bye. Good luck with the move.

203
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,640
Bye-bye.

204
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,270
3.52 meters.

205
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,650
- 3.77 meters.
- 3.42.

206
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,690
Why did you waste such a huge space in the original design for a yard?

207
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,370
Is it a waste?

208
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,360
I don't think so.

209
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,502
We can add a layer here.

210
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,870
- No, you can't.
- We can't?

211
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,740
There's a height restriction.

212
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,491
The facade of the buildings can't be changed either.

213
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,120
It has to be consistent with the residential homes.

214
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,690
Brother Ji, take a look at this place.

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,470
Can it be altered for a coffee bar so parties can be held?

216
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,300
There can't be parties at night.

217
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,610
This place has to be kept quiet after 8:30 p.m.

218
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,870
The residents need to have their rest.

219
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,190
This place is backward and has too many restrictions.

220
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,240
Why are there so many rules?

221
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,290
I bet the broken capital chain of the original owner is just an excuse.

222
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,170
He probably wants a takeover due to the unfavorable situation.

223
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,500
Exactly. The countryside is what it is.

224
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,138
We can't take over this land.

225
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,888
Which spoiled brat is this?

226
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
Brother?

227
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,640
Why are you throwing stones at the glass?

228
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,640
- For fun.
- For fun?

229
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,700
I'll... go home to cook.

230
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,440
Which one is better? Help me choose one.

231
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,110
All of them are fine.

232
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,340
You're at it again.

233
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,260
Can't live without your phone, right?

234
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,812
Is shopping with me that boring?

235
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:36,174
I'm just browsing.

236
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,740
Fine.

237
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,810
Anyway, we've moved homes.

238
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,390
If you need to hurry back to Beijing, get going.

239
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,123
I'm sick of seeing you around.

240
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:48,528
I promised Kexin to be the first relative her baby meets.

241
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,720
Isn't she due next month?

242
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,870
That's still a long time.

243
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,290
Isn't it nice to have me around?

244
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,399
Be frank with me. Are you discontent with your current job?

245
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,910
It's... okay.

246
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,986
I work from 9 to 5, and the pay is decent.

247
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:12,390
I think you're getting lazy.

248
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,522
It's so hard to find a job now.

249
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:16,290
You have to be more eager.

250
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,283
If I were a boss, I wouldn't hire you.

251
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,650
We barely see each other.

252
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,658
Now that I'm back for a few days, you're tired of me.

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,520
People shouldn't stay idle all the time.

254
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,690
Dad said the same thing.

255
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,410
Him? He should ditch this notion.

256
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,450
With his lumbar disc, what can he even do?

257
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,710
Does he intend to work until he's bedridden forever?

258
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,050
Why is he running that small supermarket and playing boss?

259
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,290
He's daydreaming.

260
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,450
Be careful.

261
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,760
Why did you buy so much toilet paper?

262
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,690
People will think we have tons of butts at home waiting to be wiped.

263
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,490
Where's you mom? She went to Building 8 to see the neighbor's renovations.

264
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,726
What neighbor?

265
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:06,170
My high school classmate who also bought a home here.

266
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,450
Which classmate?

267
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,970
Li Yulin.

268
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,960
We used to be right after each other's desks in the classroom.

269
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,450
You never mentioned this before.

270
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,960
I thought she was a nuisance.

271
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,100
By the way, you have a delivery from Yunnan.

272
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,300
The sender's surname is Xie.

273
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,900
Xie Zhiyao?

274
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,110
Who is he?

275
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,010
A village beau in Yunnan.

276
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,834
What is this?

277
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,020
- Plums.
- That's a lot of plums. Two boxes of them.

278
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,950
When... When will we even finish everything?

279
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,280
"Peaches for plums, favor for favor."

280
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,550
He sure is mindful.

281
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,340
What's this about returning favors with plums?

282
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,860
Puns are in fashion now.

283
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,070
All right. Let's move this to the kitchen.

284
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,270
Come on.

285
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,620
Here you go. I'll get you guys some water.

286
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,570
Thank you.

287
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,910
Make room for me.

288
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,920
You're here.

289
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,420
Sister.

290
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,240
By the way, Brother, this is for mouth ulcers.

291
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Apply this and you'll be fine.

292
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,510
Great.

293
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,780
You're sweet.

294
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,060
I'm not the horse ranch belle without a reason.

295
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,090
Okay, let's start our meeting.

296
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,670
Look at the third quarter development plan of the horse ranch.

297
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,550
There are three main aspects.

298
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,540
All right. That's all for today's meeting.

299
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,350
- You can head back to work.
- Okay.

300
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,830
Manager Chun, is there anything else?

301
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,740
Nope. You can leave first.

302
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,650
We'll be off.

303
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,570
Go on. Don't wait for me.

304
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,770
Brother, we're leaving.

305
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,800
We're off.

306
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,210
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.

307
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,530
What's up? What else is there?

308
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,580
Brother, have you been really stressed lately?

309
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,428
I'm fine.

310
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:33,004
Your face is so overcast.

311
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:36,962
Is there an issue with the bookstore?

312
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:39,270
Not really.

313
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,619
I just... thought things were going smoothly,

314
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,760
but there's been radio silence lately.

315
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,430
Everything has been left hanging, so I'm worried.

316
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,994
We haven't resold the homestay either.

317
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,256
To be frank,

318
00:19:57,256 --> 00:20:00,150
this matter has nothing to do with us. You're just helping them.

319
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,432
Just do what you can.

320
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:07,900
Xiaochun, you have to expand and broaden your vision.

321
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,640
This problem can't be solved just by broadening my vision.

322
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,110
I just don't want you to be anxious.

323
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,670
Got it.

324
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,564
Get going.

325
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,370
I'm leaving.

326
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,220
Brother,

327
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,623
did you read Xu Hongdou's WeChat Moments?

328
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,420
What's wrong?

329
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,350
<i>[Thanks to a certain someone for the plums, though they're very sour.]</i>

330
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,330
Is there anything else?

331
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,840
Nope.

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,891
Well, get going. Xiao Hu Lu is waiting for you.

333
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,930
Okay. I'm leaving.

334
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,290
I'm really leaving.

335
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,370
Bye-bye.

336
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,800
<i>[The plums were just picked, so they're sour. They won't go bad easily. Eat them after some time.]</i>

337
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,800
<i>[You sent too much. My dad said you beat up the plum seller.]</i>

338
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
<i>[I traveled so far for them. Of course, I have to pick more.]</i>

339
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,100
<i>[Thanks for the hard work.]</i>

340
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
<i>[Thank you~]</i>

341
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,544
<i>[Hahaha]</i>

342
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Feels amazing.

343
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,400
Look! You have knots here and here.

344
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,700
That's why your back always hurts.

345
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,800
They have to be unknotted.

346
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,000
We also have villagers skilled in massage, you know?

347
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,500
Their technique pales in comparison to yours.

348
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,400
Why are you so talented?

349
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,600
My ex-husband's cervical spine used to hurt,

350
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
so I went to learn from a masseur.

351
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
You're impressive! Amazing!

352
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,700
Bear with this for a little longer.

353
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Okay.

354
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm back.

355
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,700
Xiao Huang, you're back.

356
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,800
You're back.

357
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,000
Why are you so listless?

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm not feeling well. I've got a cold.

359
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
- Have you taken any medicine?
- I have.

360
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Enjoy yourselves. I'm going back to rest.

361
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Go to bed early.

362
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

363
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,100
What's up with Xiao Huang?

364
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,600
She hasn't eaten much lately, and she's sick now.

365
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
Is there trouble in our village?

366
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
No, there isn't.

367
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,900
Would I be clueless about troubles in the village?

368
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,800
Then, that's good. That's good.

369
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,700
But A'Yao has been behaving oddly recently.

370
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,800
When I bump into him, he doesn't respond when I call out to him.

371
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
The matter with the bookstore is left hanging.

372
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
The homestay hasn't been resold as well.

373
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,200
Both of them are pretty stressed out.

374
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Chairman Xie's mouth ulcers are really bad these days.

375
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
When people are stressed and in a bad mood,

376
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
they tend to have health problems.

377
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Before the college entrance examinations,

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
my daughter suffered from a low fever for half a month.

379
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,000
We went to the hospital but couldn't detect any issues.

380
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In the end, she recovered once the examinations were over.

381
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Looks like she did well.

382
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
How do you feel? Better now?

383
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,700
I feel amazing. I feel so relaxed now.

384
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
All done. Thank you.

385
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,000
- Thank you, Xiao Bai.
- You're welcome.

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,700
- Xiao Yu, give me your hand.
- Okay.

387
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,100
What happened to your hand?

388
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,200
It's an issue from playing the guitar. Tenosynovitis.

389
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Be gentle.

390
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm not using much strength.

391
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay. Have fun. I'm leaving.

392
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,600
- Goodbye, Aunty A'Gui.
- Bye, Aunty.

393
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
- Thank you, Xiao Bai.
- You're welcome.

394
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,500
Goodbye.

395
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,800
Be gentle, Sister.

396
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm not using any strength.

397
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,300
Relax! Relax.

398
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,400
What a big baby.

399
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
- Relax.
- Relax.

400
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,900
- It doesn't hurt, does it?
- Nah, it doesn't.

401
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,700
♫ <i>Do you ever feel alone</i> ♫

402
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, I'm fine now.

403
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
You're fine?

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600

418
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,200
My friend sent over plums from Yunnan, but they're a little sour. Try one.

419
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,900
Thank you, Second Sister.

420
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,700
Second Sister,

421
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
is this the one?

422
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Is he handsome?

423
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,100
Yes, he is.

424
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
It's just a pity.

425
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,000
Why?

426
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
It's a pity you met while you were on vacation.

427
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,400
You aren't in the same place.

428
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
After watching this promotional video,

429
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,400
do you feel like visiting that place?

430
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Yes.

431
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,100
I think it's pretty good.

432
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,000
What appealed to you?

433
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,524
The environment and the atmosphere of the people there seem relaxing.

434
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
I think so, too.

435
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,500
It's a very quaint place.

436
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,500
It has natural greenery, lakes, and mountains.

437
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,200
Time passes very slowly there.

438
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,500
It's reminiscent of our time as kids at Grandma's place.

439
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
There were so many white clouds.

440
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,800
It also has... fresh air,

441
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
radiant sunlight,

442
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,600
and exceptional weather.

443
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,800
It's completely different from life here.

444
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
In that small place, the same few people

445
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
live with each other.

446
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,900
You will see others,

447
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,600
as well as yourself.

448
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,800
You can even feel the essence of life.

449
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,900
It's not about living in a big mansion or driving a luxury car.

450
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,900
It's about chatting with friends in the sun after a meal.

451
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,000
We work so hard just to be able to

452
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
enjoy life outside of work.

453
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
How wonderful.

454
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,300
In my current situation, I don't know when I can take a vacation.

455
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,900
Before I got married, I went on trips with my friends every year.

456
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,500
At that time, Sister Nan Nan was able to

457
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,400
offer us staff family discounts.

458
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,000
In a blink of an eye,

459
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm a mother now.

460
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,600
It's been a year since Sister Nan Nan passed away.

461
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,500
Time flies. It's like a dream.

462
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,600
It's like flipping through a book, page after page.

463
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Page after page.

464
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,110
<i>Coming.</i>

465
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,100
<i>Who is it?</i>
- <i>Aunty, it's me.</i>

466
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,200
Yulin! Here's a pumpkin for you.

467
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
My mom sent it over from my hometown.

468
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,100
It's organic. Good stuff.

469
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,700
- Who is it?
- <i>You're so kind!</i>

470
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,400
Yesterday, when I was shopping in the supermarket,

471
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
I met a high school friend who lives in Building 8.

472
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
She sells insurance.

473
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,510
That's nice.

474
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,210
This naughty boy!

475
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
It's good for boys to be a little mischievous.

476
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,100
<i>Aunty, where's Hongdou?</i>

477
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,300
<i>Her cousin is here. They're chatting in the room.</i>

478
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,600
I'll go over and say hi.

479
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,700
<i>I still have stuff to do at home.</i>

480
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
<i>Don't go back. I'm leaving.</i>

481
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,660
<i>Stay for a bit.</i>

482
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
- Chief.
- It's hot!

483
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
Your dough is fermented excellently.

484
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
Of course. Let me do it.

485
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,900
It's a pity that you aren't selling buns, you know?

486
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,820
Come on. Hongdou!

487
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,480
- Hongdou!
- All right.

488
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,100
Come over. Look, freshly steamed buns.

489
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,400
Take them to Li Yulin.

490
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,800
What's with that?

491
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
She gave us pumpkins and free-range eggs.

492
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Besides, you should hang out with your classmates.

493
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,900
Don't just stare at your home at home.

494
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Here's one more box.

495
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Daughter, as the lobby manager of a hotel,

496
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,200
are you afraid of meeting people?

497
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm the Deputy Manager of the Rooms Division.

498
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,400
Did you hear that? Deputy Manager of Rooms Division.

499
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
- Deputy Manager.
- I'm her dad.

500
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,800
You took so long to come back.

501
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Their house is so noisy.

502
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,600
I went to the roof with her for a breather.

503
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,300
She tried to sell insurance to you again, right?

504
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,100
It's not easy to balance a part-time job with raising a child.

505
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,600
Don't buy any if you don't want to.

506
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,100
It's fine.

507
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,300
It's so snobbish to sell things when old classmates meet.

508
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,800
Don't say that.

509
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,700
Interpersonal relationships are the crux in such a small place.

510
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,400
Besides, insurance is usually sold to acquaintances first.

511
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,200
Isn't that just taking advantage of one's friends?

512
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
What do you mean by that?

513
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Regular insurance can be bought from anyone.

514
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
I bought it.

515
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
What did you buy?

516
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,000
Dad's car insurance.

517
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
We bought your dad's car insurance

518
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
from your aunty's nephew's wife's second aunt.

519
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,600
In the future, buy from Li Yulin.

520
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,700
Why?

521
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,000
Because we're former classmates.

522
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
We're best buddies.

523
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,100
Mom is right.

524
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,300
Insurance should be bought from decent folks.

525
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,000
It doesn't really matter who we buy from, right?

526
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,100
That's right.

527
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,400
- Dou.
- How am I supposed to explain this to your aunt?

528
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll talk to her.

529
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,300
That's not it. Couldn't you have asked me first?

530
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,200
Why didn't you call and ask me?

531
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,000
All-inclusive customized company tour.

532
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
How many people?

533
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
More than 20?

534
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,500
The number of people isn't a problem,

535
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,900
but we've never hosted such a group before.

536
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,000
The price is pretty good, though.

537
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Book the homestay in town first.

538
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
With just three nights, our village has enough activities

539
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
to keep them fully occupied.

540
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Who offered you this deal?

541
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>It's a coincidence.</i>

542
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Several days ago, I was at the supermarket with my mom.

543
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,100
I met a female high school classmate who used to sit behind me.

544
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,300
We chatted and found out that we lived in the same estate.

545
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,200
A female classmate?

546
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
Yes, a female classmate.

547
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,400
After chatting, I found out that she's pretty awesome.

548
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,000
She sells eggs, free-range chicken, peanut oil, and insurance on WeChat.

549
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,800
<i>Companies have staff benefits at the end of the year, right?</i>

550
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,200
She went from door to door to sell products.

551
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
She earns more than a regular job.

552
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Okay.

553
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,200
Thank you for looking out for us.

554
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,300
I'll ponder over this

555
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,400
and send you a proposal.

556
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,400
You want to brainstorm with me?

557
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
But I'll be staying up all night.

558
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,800
You don't have to join me.

559
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,900
Okay.

560
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
See you online at 10:00 p.m.

561
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,700
I'm hanging up.

563
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,900
You're grinning from ear to ear.

564
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,400
Who was that?

565
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So sappy.

566
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's a devotion that distance can't fracture.

567
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,800
What are you doing?

568
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
We're discussing work.

569
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,400
That's just a farce.

570
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
It's your turn to play a tile.

571
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
Hurry up.

572
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Eight dots.

573
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Pung.

574
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,800
Brother, you're short on tiles.

575
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,600
Didn't I draw a tile?

576
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,400
Love really makes one muddled.

577
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,900
You're even trying to get a pure suit?

578
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,000
You guys can play on.

579
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,100
Sure, let's continue.

580
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,900
Come on, Granny.

581
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,340
What are you doing?

582
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,901
- What's going on?
- She's on the phone.

583
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:46,676
You're eavesdropping?

584
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:48,070
<i>Yes.</i>

585
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>Chinese are just passionate about growing vegetables.</i>

586
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,091
<i>Last time when Xu Hongmi visited, we picked vegetables and cooked lunch with them.</i>

587
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:56,262
<i>It was very fun.</i>

588
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,540
<i>The ingredients are fresh and healthy.</i>

589
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,380
<i>For example...</i>

590
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,060
<i>Okay. That's good.</i>

591
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,010
What is she busy with?

592
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,610
She's back, but her heart is still out there.

593
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,790
What do you mean? Why is her heart still out there?

594
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,300
I can't communicate with a geezer like you.

595
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,190
Go back to bed. Move it.

596
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,880
Come back.

597
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,180
Take a bath.

598
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,480
Didn't we agree to every two days...

599
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,510
Okay, I'll bathe.

600
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,098
I'll take a bath.

601
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,040
Go on.

602
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,890
- The oil!
- Quickly, add it in.

603
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,030
Do I just add it?

604
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,530
The oil is sizzling. Hurry up.

605
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,320
Goodness.

606
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,710
Don't run away. Come here.

607
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,110
Fry it. Fry the food.

608
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,360
The oil is spraying out.

609
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,090
Of course.

610
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,760
Well... what do we do?

611
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
Be scalded for a little.

612
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,348
But it hurts.

613
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:26,778
Aren't you scared?

614
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:29,442
Will it stop hurting if I'm scared?

615
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:30,920
Add the soy sauce.

616
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,500
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

617
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,660
Where are you going? That one.

618
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,190
- This one?
- Yeah.

619
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,950
Soy sauce.

620
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,630
Enough.

621
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,030
That's enough for two servings!

622
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,510
What's the use of having a man around?

623
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,660
- Xiaochun, you're here.
- Sister Manjun.
- Hey.

624
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,440
- H-Have you eaten?
- I've eaten.

625
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,900
It smells great.

626
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,550
Are you here for Xiao Huang?

627
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,350
No, I'm here for you.

628
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,430
- Why?
- Stop. Let me do it.

629
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,660
Be careful, don't burn yourself.

630
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,190
What's the matter?

631
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,780
Well,

632
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,410
I recently heard that the kindergarten is hosting a celebration.

633
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,874
You volunteered to help with the choir rehearsals for Xiao Hu Lu's class. Right?

634
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,700
Can you put Xiao Hu Lu in the middle as the lead singer?

635
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,400
Xiao Hu Lu is too tall to stand in the middle.

636
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,490
Why won't it do?

637
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:32,661
Look. If the middle person is tall, the other kids can form a nice roof shape.

638
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:34,670
- Isn't that pretty?
- Not at all.

639
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,980
Why not? Sister Manjun, what do you think?

640
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,150
I think it's fine.

641
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,520
Look. I'm right.

642
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,319
But the lead singer should be the best singer, right?

643
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,090
Otherwise, the other children won't be convinced.

644
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,280
Her days in kindergarten will be tough as well.

645
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,372
Is Xiao Hu Lu a good singer?

Sister Qiu, are you busy?

676
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,840
I was hoping to ask for your advice.

677
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,880
Can I call you?

678

<i>[Sister Qiu]</i>

679
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,964
Hello, Sister Qiu. Are you busy?

680
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,631
I don't quite understand some of the suggestions you offered about setting up a homestay.

681
00:39:57,631 --> 00:39:59,530
So, I wanted to consult you about them.

682
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:07,200
Okay. I'll tell you some details about the homestay.

683
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,324
Help me assess them.

684
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,150
We're out of dark soy sauce. We won't have any for tomorrow.

685
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,220
Dou! Dou!

686
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,740
Don't call for her. I'll buy it.

687
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,090
She's busy on the phone, calling this guy and that lady.

688
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,790
She's busy with her business.

689
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,060
You eavesdropped on her again.

690
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,030
No, she has to go.

691
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,610
She hasn't left the room for a day.

692
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,610
Hurry up. Get her to go. Hurry up.

693
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,110
Dou!

694
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,470
I'm at the supermarket.

695
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,170
My mom asked me to buy dark soy sauce.

696
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,030
I want to ask you something.

697
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,490
What's the lowest price to sell the village's homestay these days?

698
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,440
The lowest price for the rent and the resell fee.

699
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,990
A friend asked about it. Please inquire for me.

700
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,960
It doesn't seem right to just ask about the price.

701
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,370
Don't they want to take a look?

702
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,670
I've seen the place and sent them the photos.

703
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,290
They just want to know the current situation.

704
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,594
Please help me ask about this.

705
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,790
<i>Okay. I'll tell you when I find out.</i>

706
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,560
Okay. I'll leave you to your work.

707
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,970
I'm hanging up.

708
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,440
Chat with me for a bit.

709
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,220
Don't be so work driven on the phone.

710
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,380
<i>What do you want to chat about?</i>

711
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,130
When will you return to Beijing?

712
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,850
<i>I haven't decided yet.</i>

713
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,298
Are you undecided about the job or the date of return?

714
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:37,300
Both of them. Let's talk about something else.

715
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,702
How are your ulcers?

716
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:44,852
You should take more vitamin B and avoid staying up late.

717
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,520
I know.

718
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,230
But when people are focused on a task, they'll be worried,

719
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,220
fearful, anxious, and in turmoil.

720
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,128
I think you'll receive good news this time.

721
00:41:57,128 --> 00:41:59,190
<i>You think so?</i>

722
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,480
A woman's intuition is very accurate.

723
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,700
A woman's intuition?

724
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,140
Fine. I trust you.

725
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,550
