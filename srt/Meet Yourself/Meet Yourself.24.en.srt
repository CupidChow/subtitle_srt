<i>[Youfeng Courtyard]</i>

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,460
Use these and eat it yourself.

5
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,580
Do the tenants tidy the place themselves?

6
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,160
Aunty A'Gui is in charge of the communal areas.

7
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,360
It's quite a cozy and quiet place.

8
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,200
I saw Xie Zhiyao from the front of your room.

9
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
He lives next door.

10
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,560
Yesterday, I asked him some questions.

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,679
He told me he worked in Beijing for many years

12
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,740
in the investment industry.

13
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,639
He stayed and worked in Beijing after university.

14
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,160
Some time ago, it was his grandpa's death anniversary and his dad came back.

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,700
I met him once.

16
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,920
According to his dad,

17
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,459
his family actually isn't very supportive of him coming back to start a business.

18
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,000
After all, to them, youngsters who leave the countryside

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,900
won't be willing to return unless they're desperate.

20
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,779
I took a stroll around the village and didn't see many tourists here.

21
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,900
Let's give the place a few years.

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,359
When this place gains publicity and builds a reputation,

23
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,279
and Shaohua Bookstore is built, things will be different.

24
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,439
That's not necessarily true.

25
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,540
Tons of nice places lack visitors.

26
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,700
That's a possibility.

27
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,300
But I believe this place can get better.

28
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,380
Actually, it's been hard for Xie Zhiyao.

29
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,640
Look.

30
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,139
Everyone in the village goes to him whenever they have troubles.

31
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,520
But he can only deal with his own problems himself.

32
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,540
He's still so cheerful and never complains.

33
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,380
People will think he has an easy life.

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,420
What's wrong?

35
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,019
He works so hard.

36
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,420
What about you?

37
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,120
When are you going to look for a new job?

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,980
I'll probably wait for another month.

39
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,799
After I head back and help our parents move into a new house, I'll find a job.

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,920
Do you still want to return to Beijing?

41
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,340
Won't you consider coming to Shanghai?

42
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,219
I've thought about it, but I still want to live in Beijing.

43
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,739
Actually, Shanghai has its advantages.

44
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,440
Huangpu District is lined with fiver-star hotels.

45
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,159
Your brother-in-law has an old apartment there as well.

46
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,040
The tenant's lease is ending soon.

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,860
If you want to come over, we can tidy up the place for you.

48
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Your brother-in-law said as long as you pay for the utility and maintenance bills

49
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,200
and visit Lingdang occasionally to play with her, that's enough.

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
This must be our parents' idea.

51
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,060
So, you've discussed this with them?

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,160
Yeah.

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,319
Your brother-in-law and I are in Shanghai.

54
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,600
We can help each other when things get difficult.

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,959
Thank you for your kind offer,

56
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,300
but I can't trouble you two.

57
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,340
I already have a plan in mind.

58
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,599
A fellow alumnus in Beijing is working in a five-star hotel's HR Department.

59
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,720
He wants me to work in the Staff Training Department there.

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,699
Well, if you had a boyfriend in Beijing,

61
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,960
I wouldn't be talking you out of this.

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,720
But what do you have in Beijing?

63
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
Nothing much.

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm just used to living there.

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,000
You seem to have gotten used to life here as well.

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
I knew it.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,940
You're here to lecture me.

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,559
Is this considered lecturing?

69
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,140
Of course.

70
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,359
There are four people in our family. Mom is the president.

71
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,159
Dad is the general manager.

72
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,759
You're the head of a department.

73
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,159
I'm the only employee. Isn't that right?

74
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,159
Now that the president has retired, you've taken over.

75
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,739
Everyone has to report their actions to you. Isn't that right?

76
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:53,320
It's only natural that you're here to lecture me.

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,659
If we run with your analogy, I'm the assistant running errands for the president.

78
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,319
You're clearly the boss's daughter who just took office.

79
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,439
You're capricious and stubborn.

80
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,899
The president and the general manager have no control over you and are even afraid of you.

81
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,859
So, their assistant, me, is sandwiched in between.

82
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,020
Besides, this is nothing more than a thankless job.

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,919
Are our parents afraid of me?

84
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,899
Yeah. They're afraid of you. They're always reading your mood.

85
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,320
Ever since young, they've been partial to you.

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,460
They told me to be nice to you because I'm the older one.

87
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,279
When have you ever done that?

88
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,819
Why would I be nice to you?

89
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,319
Why should I?

90
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,839
Crybaby.

91
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,719
Crybaby?

92
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,319
Yes, a crybaby.

93
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,439
You cried when a chicken died.

94
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,239
When the rabbit and the goldfish died, you cried.

95
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,099
The balsam incident was the most ridiculous.

96
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,039
I picked some to paint my nails, but you still cried.

97
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,340
I got scolded every time you cried.

98
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,739
You killed the goldfish because you gave it too much food.

99
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:56,939
The rabbit had diarrhea and died because you fed it too many vegetables.

100
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,919
You didn't even leave a single balsam flower for me. How could you feel aggrieved?

101
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,939
Our mom killed the rabbit and blamed it on me.

102
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,740
How many times have I told you this?

103
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,879
You fed it, too.

104
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,900
Look at you.

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,839
Don't tell me to look at myself like our dad.

106
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm not going to look!

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,780
I won't go to Shanghai.

108
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,640
Why not?

109
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,160
I've got many connections there.

110
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't want to go there because you're there.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,459
Fine, that's better. I can't be bothered with you.

112
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,219
When two dogs fight, neither gets away unscathed.

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,420
- Don't talk like Grandma.
- Don't talk like Grandma.

114
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,680
Finish your meal.

115
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,440
Mom, I've said whatever I had to say. She still wants to go back to Beijing.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,219
<i>Dou always makes us worry about her.</i>

117
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,179
<i>Now, she doesn't even listen to you.</i>

118
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,419
When has she ever heeded my words?

119
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,660
What's wrong with Second Sister?

120
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,039
God knows who she takes after. It's nothing.

121
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
<i>She takes after Grandma.</i>

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,460
<i>Mom,</i>

123
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,199
<i>Lingdang talks like you now.</i>

124
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,320
She said Dou and I are two bleeding dogs after a fight.

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,340
It's only been two days, and you're fighting?

126
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,019
<i>How can I be a match for her?</i>

127
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,060
She has a sharp tongue.

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,779
She said you're the president and Dad is the general manager.

129
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,339
I'm the head of a department. All of us are trying to order her around.

130
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,000
Isn't that great?

131
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,899
President, there's a minor issue.

132
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,959
I don't think it's a problem, but I reckon I should report it to you.

133
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,220
Don't be glib. What is it?

134
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,999
Do you remember the man in Dou's video? Chairman Xie.

135
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,360
I think Dou has feelings for him.

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,940
Really?

137
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,540
But... he's living too far away.

138
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,639
Dou doesn't seem keen on developing this relationship.

139
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,140
Do you remember her ex-boyfriend, Ke Ji?

140
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,839
<i>The one who wanted her to transfer to a hotel at West Fifth Ring Road.</i>

141
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,020
<i>Then, she dumped him.</i>

142
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,439
Don't worry, Dou won't go anywhere for a man

143
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:23,080
or stay in a place for a man.

144
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,599
We don't even know if he's a decent person.

145
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,860
She's at the age for marriage.

146
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,760
- It's nothing.
<i>- Mom.</i>

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,439
Mom, I need to attend to something. Let's end this call.

148
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay, all right. Get on with your work.

149
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,819
Your dad went grocery shopping. We're making dumplings for Kexin this afternoon.

150
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:40,660
<i>Okay.</i>

151
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,240
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

152
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,019
Aunty, what happened to Second Sister?

153
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,120
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

154
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,979
She's on a vacation in Yunnan.

155
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,779
Her sister is also there with her child.

156
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,300
That's nice.

157
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,979
When both of them were little, they were like wood and fire.

158
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:01,440
They would explode at the smallest bump.

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,559
You aren't in a position to comment. It's as if you don't fight with your second sister.

160
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,239
Distance makes the heart grow fonder,

161
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:11,200
but as soon as they meet, they'll quarrel in less than three minutes.

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,780
You're right.

163
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,780
None of the girls in our family have a good temper.

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,660
If Kexin gives birth to a daughter, it'll be even more uproarious.

165
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
She better not.

166
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,679
Xiaochun went to the warehouse to check on delivered goods.

167
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,620
This divine beast will do her homework here today.

168
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,920
Lingdang, didn't you head out to explore?

169
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,340
Is she working?

170
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,219
What are you doing?

171
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:57,799
I'm playing Go.

172
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,939
Can I watch you play?

173
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,520
Sure.

174
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,780
Chairman Xie, you're here.

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Hongdou.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,279
- We're out of oranges. We need five more catties.
- I'll get them.

177
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,620
Five catties? That's heavy.

178
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
I'll go with you.

179
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,699
- Aren't you busy?
- Not at all.

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,160
Na Na, give me the bike keys.

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,279
Chairman Xie, the bike is inside.

182
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,540
Wait for me here.

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,360
Five catties.

184
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,380
That's so heavy.

185
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,379
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,420
What's wrong? Did you quarrel with your sister?

187
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,199
We didn't. She failed to convince me.

188
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,600
Convince you?

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,240
About what?

190
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,420
My parents have always wanted me to work in Shanghai.

191
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,199
My sister found out about my resignation, so she's here to persuade me to go to Shanghai.

192
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,159
I guess your parents just want you two to help each other.

193
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,279
Yeah, but we won't be helping each other if I'm in Shanghai.

194
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,879
It'll just be my sister singlehandedly aiding me.

195
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,260
She'll poke her nose into everything,

196
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,760
and I'll just be like a parasite.

197
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,959
Even if my brother-in-law agrees, he has a large family in Shanghai.

198
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,600
If they know that he has to take care of his wife's sister,

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,499
they'll ask him to take care of his cousins and other relatives.

200
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:45,499
You aren't even married yet. Why do you have so many considerations?

201
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,580
I haven't experienced it myself, but I've seen enough.

202
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,559
You and your sister are like a couple with a love-hate relationship.

203
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,160
You care about each other,

204
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,510
but your stubborn pride forbids you from being honest with each other.

205
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,719
I talked to her nicely, but she got agitated for no reason.

206
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:06,919
Look! She isn't even enjoying her trip. She just works and answers calls.

207
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,860
She's as busy as a bee.

208
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
When I talk to her, she ignores me.

209
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,220
Since she's so busy, why did she come looking for you?

210
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,280
To lecture me.

211
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,420
She could've just called you.

212
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,679
I mean, why did she travel for miles,

213
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,159
endured altitude sickness, insomnia from headaches,

214
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,100
and even suffered nosebleeds at night?

215
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
Nosebleeds?

216
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Who told you this?

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
The boss of the homestay.

218
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,959
I called him to ask him to take care of Sister Hongmi.

219
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,300
He told me

220
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,619
Sister Hongmi called the front desk in the middle of the night asking for painkillers.

221
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,139
When they were cleaning her room in the morning, they found her pillow cover stained with blood.

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,190
Try to grasp the true nature of what lies under the surface.

223
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,060
She's just worried after finding out about your resignation

224
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,910
and came to check on you to see how you're doing.

225
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,220
Those are coordinates.

226
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,959
Not bad, Miss Knowledgeable. You even know they're coordinates.

227
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,260
This is for you.

228
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,059
Rhodiola tea. It can strengthen your immune system.

229
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,220
The grannies in the village made it.

230
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,140
This can is all yours.

231
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,919
I wiped it. It's not dirty. Only the colors have faded.

232
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,840
This is good stuff.

233
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,440
It's quite expensive.

234
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,559
Take your time drinking it. It's good for your health.

235
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,440
That's a lot.

236
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,859
I just bought this cup as well. It's brand new.

237
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,080
Well, the weather is dry.

238
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Drink more water and focus on your work.

239
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,160
- Okay.
- I'll get on with my work.

240
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,080
Okay.

241
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,660
Smells amazing. Did you add roses?

242
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,300
Yes.

243
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,239
You made so much.

244
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,640
This isn't much. It's just nice for sharing with the neighbors.

245
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,939
Have a taste.

246
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,700
I'll get you some bottles.

247
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,660
Try it. See if it tastes good.

248
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,640
It does taste like roses. You should have a taste.

249
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,380
Take another sip.

250
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,939
Tonight, when we treat your sister to dinner, let her try it too.

251
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,180
You know what? I realized that after I got here,

252
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,580
no matter where I go,

253
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,720
no one lets me leave empty-handed.

254
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,599
Rest assured. When you leave, I won't let you go empty-handed.

255
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
What are you going to give me?

256
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,179
You name it. What do you want?

257
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,240
Can I ask for anything?

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,740
Anything but money.

259
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,700
Relax. I'll only ask for things you have.

260
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,760
- Here they are.
- Come on.

261
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
- We'll fill them up.
- Here you go.

262
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,420
Do I use this?

263
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,580
Yes, you can use either of them.

264
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,699
Stop playing. Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.

265
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,780
Lingdang, let's go.

266
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,300
Xu Hongdou.

267
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,599
Can you take a look at what's on the back of my neck?

268
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,339
Don't move. It's a bee.

269
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,220
Help me get rid of it.

270
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Is it gone?

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,039
Don't touch it. Did you get stung? Let me see.

272
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,659
I doubt so. Did I?

273
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,920
Dinner is ready. Come on.

274
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,120
Sister Hongmi, this is the rose wine a lady in the village made.

275
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,160
Have a taste.

276
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,320
In her house, I saw a lot of vats this big. They're all full of this wine. Try it.

277
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,699
Yeah. If someone gets married in the village,

278
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,820
we need to prepare this in advance.

279
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

280
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,999
I'll treat this as a farewell toast.

281
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

282
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,780
Aren't you leaving the day after tomorrow?

283
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,279
I need to make a sudden trip to Beijing for work.

284
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,000
The day after that, I'll return to Shanghai.

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,940
Are you taking Lingdang with you?

286
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,660
My assistant is coming with us tomorrow.

287
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,320
I was planning to show you around the Old Town tomorrow.

288
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,120
There's no need. I'm not here for sightseeing anyway.

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm here to give you a lecture.

290
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,120
Thank you for your hospitality.

291
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,459
I must've been quite the hassle.

292
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,359
Not at all. I was hoping you could stay longer.

293
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,520
- I mean it.
- Cheers.

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,319
Sister, drink less. You're going on a business trip.

295
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
It taste good, right?

296
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,099
It's made of the roses that you said were ugly

297
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,580
when we drove past the rose fields.

298
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,159
- Did I say that?
- You did.

299
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,620
You said it as we drove past.

300
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,180
Don't pretend that you don't remember.

301
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,579
Chairman Xie heard you as well. Right?

302
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,659
I didn't. I was driving.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,440
Chairman Xie, here.

304
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,260
May your business prosper.

305
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,180
Thank you.

306
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,420
Aunty Hongmi, when are you going to bring Lingdang over again?

307
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,400
We may not come again,

308
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,090
because we're only here as tourists.

309
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,070
We'll travel somewhere else next time.

310
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,520
Aren't we coming to visit Aunty?

311
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,640
Aunty is also a tourist.

312
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,799
It doesn't matter.

313
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,019
You can still meet through video calls.

314
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Yeah. You can call each other.

315
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,780
Let's eat.

316
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Sister, drink this honey water.

317
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,599
Rice wine is mild, but it's still wine.

318
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,760
You still have a business trip tomorrow.

319
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
Are you going to Shanghai?

320
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,540
Drink this first, all right?

321
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,720
Are you going or not?

322
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
I...

323
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
I'll visit you when I have the time. All right?

324
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,620
Got it.

325
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,640
You hate me.

326
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,419
- I don't hate you.
- You hate me.

327
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,080
You don't want to go there because I'm there.

328
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,780
You sure remembered that clearly.

329
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,680
It's all my fault.

330
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,920
I shouldn't have said that.

331
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,140
Well, do you know what I really meant?

332
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,960
I don't want to add to your burdens.

333
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
If you don't want to add to our burdens,

334
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,820
please lead a proper life.

335
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,100
You didn't even tell us that you quit your job.

336
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,300
These days, you don't tell me a thing.

337
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,700
I can only find out about your life

338
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,380
from your WeChat Moments or your friends.

339
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,439
I miss the times when we were little.

340
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:25,660
You were always following me around.

341
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,640
That little Hongdou.

342
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,159
I'm so mad at you.

343
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,199
Are you acting crazy while drunk?

344
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,499
Why are you hitting me?

345
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,559
- I want to!
- Crazy drunkard.

346
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,599
I'm going to hit you.

347
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,639
I'll retaliate if you keep hitting me.

348
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,720
- I'll hit you!
- I'm going to hit you back!

349
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,219
She's drunk. Why are you sitting there and letting her hit you? Run.

350
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:51,780
I'll tell our parents that you got yourself drunk and hit me.

351
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,799
I'll tell Mom that you started dating in junior high using wine bottles.

352
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,020
When did I do that?

353
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,640
You did.

354
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,380
Are you talking about drift bottles?

355
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,040
You two.

356
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,379
I'm warning you. Don't be blinded by your feelings.

357
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,320
It's fine.

358
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,380
This is the backyard.

359
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,159
The main building has been constructed.

360
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,519
There are eight rooms in total.

361
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,700
Even the smallest room is around 40 square meters.

362
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,280
Look over here.

363
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,100
There are four suites upstairs with an excellent view.

364
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,659
The boss wants to make this a boutique homestay.

365
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,760
Sounds impressive.

366
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,980
Exactly.

367
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,119
Yes, the boss said that the main building and the interior design were decided together.

368
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,400
He can pass you the interior design layout if necessary.

369
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
We'll take a look around.

370
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,640
Take your time.

371
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,800
Give me a refill.

372
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,819
Xiao Huang, this is a triple-shot espresso.

373
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,900
You can't drink anymore or it'll keep you awake at night.

374
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,920
Look at how much I'm exercising during the day.

375
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Even if you throw a pillow in the pigsty,

376
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,960
I'll fall asleep on it immediately.

377
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,940
We have cold brew Thousand Fragrances. How about a change?

378
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,780
Sure.

379
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,480
Is that her? Is she the influencer?

380
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,960
What's wrong?

381
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
Someone's taking pictures of me.

382
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,079
Where are you from?

383
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,320
We're from Shanghai.

384
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,460
Shanghai?

385
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,399
Why did you choose to come here?

386
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,639
We saw your promotional video.

387
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,820
You're even prettier in person.

388
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,100
Promotional video?

389
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,560
Yes.

390
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,479
Well, what do you think of this place?

391
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,699
It's excellent. We just arrived this morning.

392
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:18,999
We're planning to visit the beautiful sites that were featured in the video.

393
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:22,359
- Yeah.
- I know those places. I can fill you in.
- You do?

394
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,860
- Can I add you on WeChat?
- Come on.

395
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,060
- Of course.
- Great.

396
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,600
- We're off. Bye.
- Bye.

397
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you have a camera phobia?

398
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,040
Kind of.

399
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,259
For such a pretty girl like you, it must be annoying

400
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,520
to have strangers taking photos of you all the time.

401
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,280
I'm pretty?

402
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,160
Tell me. How am I pretty?

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,999
You're pretty in an unassuming manner.

404
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,299
It's beauty from within.

405
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,300
You're unaware of your own beauty.

406
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,439
That's really pleasing to hear. Don't get cocky.

407
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,160
All right, I should go. I'm off to the village committee.

408
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,220
By the way, I packed your Thousand Fragrances.

409
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,580
Thanks.

410
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't forget to come and try my new dishes tomorrow.

411
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,039
That's poison-tasting.

412
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,079
Look for Xia Xia instead. I'm off. Bye-bye.

413
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,820
See you.

414
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,300
Did she leave in the morning?

415
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,039
Sister Hongdou isn't like her sister at all.

416
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,160
Did you meet her too?

417
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,600
She came to the wood carving workshop.

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,580
The wood painting hanging on the wall

419
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,879
in the east room for two years was carved by my master.

420
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:50,420
It's the ridiculously expensive treasure in our workshop. She bought it.

421
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,460
I saw the name of the recipient was Xu Hongmi.

422
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,280
So, I asked her if she was Sister Hongdou's sister.

423
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,960
She said yes.

424
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,200
Tell Xiaolan to remove it from the web store right away.

425
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,520
Don't worry. I told him as soon as she bought it.

426
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,620
<i>[Unknown Number]</i>

427
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,060
Hello? Who is it?

428
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,840
Yes. This is Youfeng Courtyard. There is an option for a short-term lease.

429
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,480
Are you a couple or are you coming alone?

430
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,040
Thanks, Mom.

431
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,659
A lady, right? When will you arrive?

432
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,179
Okay. I'll note this down. Please hold on.

433
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,879
Initially, they wouldn't let me sing that song.

434
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,380
They wanted me to sing their songs.

435
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,719
I said, "Hold on, listen to my song first."

436
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,199
"If you think it sucks, I'll sing your songs."

437
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,519
I started singing.

438
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,499
Then, the person in charge said, "All right, enough. Mr. Hu, stop. We get it."

439
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,640
So, did you manage to sing your song?

440
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,619
Nope. I sang their songs.

441
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,480
The audience didn't have the fortune to hear it. Two characters.

442
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,680
Pung.

443
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Sorry.

444
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,199
Granny, are you waiting for your last tile?

445
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:57,879
Nope. I haven't got a pair.

446
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,620
Pung.

447
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,160
Three characters.

448
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,039
Don't peep. I'm helping you.

449
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,459
Thanks, but there's no need.

450
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,879
Game by my own draw. I was waiting for my last tile.

451
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,319
Not bad, Hongdou. You're lucky.

452
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,619
- Here.
- Hold on. Why are you calling the game for such a lousy hand?

453
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:21,360
That's none of your business.

454
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,140
- A'Yao!
- Yeah!

455
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,161
Aunty Feng, we're in the room.

456
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,420
Are you playing Mahjong?

457
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,340
- Here, I brought some vegetables for you.
- Hello, Aunty Feng.

458
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,060
I went to the farm this afternoon.

459
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,039
- You brought so much.
- Thank you!

460
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,160
They're very fresh.

461
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
- No, save it. I won't.
- Take my seat.

462
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,990
I'm not playing. I'll just sit with Granny for a while.

463
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,070
Aunty Feng, play with us.

464
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,860
Don't let him play. His luck sucks. It's horrible.

465
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,220
I was trying to let you win.

466
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,300
Well, you guys play.

467
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,419
I'll make wolfberry tea for you guys. Hongdou, is that okay?

468
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,960
Where's the pu'er tea that Mr. Ma left behind?

469
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,759
Why do you want to drink pu'er tea at night? We're going with wolfberry.

470
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,120
Well, why did you ask me?

471
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,080
Play on.

472
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,819
Don't play this tile. Play that one.

473
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:05,700
I need this for a pair.

474
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,159
I don't see it on the table.

475
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,280
What if they have it?

476
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,100
Excuse me. Are you having a meeting?

477
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,820
Well, play this.

478
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,020
Seven dots.

479
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,700
Kong.

480
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,239
Newbie, don't mislead me.

481
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,560
Terrible luck. Exactly.

482
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,739
Wait, Aunty Feng. You're so unscrupulous. You're horrible.

483
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,000
Four characters.

484
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,660
Game.

485
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,200
Granny, you... That's such a lousy hand to win with.

486
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,240
At least, I won.

487
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,300
I was so close to a pure suit!

488
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,219
All your whispering has ruined my tiles.

489
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,260
What a curse.

490
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,060
A real pity.

491
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,600
Mr. Ma, how long are you planning to stay this time?

492
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,960
Tomorrow, I'm going to meet some tea masters and then return to Beijing at night.

493
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,440
<i>Is she coming?</i>

494
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,020
Why have you started eating?

495
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,379
These are for our pretty new neighbor!

496
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:00,079
You're leaving seed shells and peanut shells all over the place.

497
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,839
She'll think we don't give a damn about her!

498
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,399
Calm down.

499
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,299
Why do you seem so excited every time you meet a pretty girl?

500
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,079
"Seem excited"?

501
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,999
I'm excited from the bottom of my heart!

502
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm over the moon!

503
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,320
What if this new neighbor falls in love with me?

504
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,960
A sweet love story will blossom.

505
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm drinking good tea. I really don't want to throw it up.

506
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,359
Yes, go ahead.

507
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,639
Mr. Ma, listen up.

508
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,579
Ever since you started your business, you've become so vulgar.

509
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:33,619
You're no longer a man with depth.

510
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,760
Hurry up and get ready.

511
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,219
Later, you still have to perform a tea ceremony for the new girl.

512
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,580
Pooh.

513
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,020
Hongdou, come on.

514
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,979
What?

515
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,220
Take these.

516
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,419
You've seen these before, right?

517
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,900
Later, when I sing,
♫ <i>Meeting you is like a bamboo forest embracing early summer</i> ♫

518
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,580
♫ <i>birds meeting waves, and the desert...</i> ♫

519
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,640
- You're so cooperative.
- Yes, that's right. That's the feeling.

520
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,759
You're doing it perfectly.

521
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,200
You should just kneel at her door.

522
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,460
It'll be most effective if you sing there.

523
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,540
You're such a nuisance.

524
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,900
What's wrong with me?

525
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,959
Don't move. I'll help you with it.

526
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,220
She's here! Get in formation!

527
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,400
Smile.

528
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,320
Show me your smile.

529
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Xinxin, you're here too.

530
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,660
Where's our gorgeous new neighbor?

531
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,019
Let me introduce her to you.

532
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:24,880
This is our new tenant and your gorgeous new neighbor.

533
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm your gorgeous new neighbor.

534
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Surprise!

535
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,079
Let's go back to our rooms.

536
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,340
- Don't do that.
- Go back.

537
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,539
- What's wrong with you, Mr. Hu?
- What are you doing?

538
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,220
I'm just pulling your leg. Don't be so uptight.

539
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,619
Xinxin, are you really moving in?

540
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,079
Her dormitory is leaking and needs roof repairs.

541
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,200
So, she'll stay here for two months.

542
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,619
Mr. Hu, don't be too dejected.

543
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:50,460
In a few days, a new female tenant is really moving in.

544
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,519
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

545
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,740
When will she arrive?

546
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,420
Am I that unwelcome here?

547
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,820
I don't mean that, Xiao Huang.

548
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,100
It's just... you played with my feelings.

549
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,859
Xinxin, have a seat first.

550
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,839
Later, Mr. Ma will perform a tea ceremony for you.

551
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,599
I'll help you unpack.

552
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,500
Okay.

553
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,820
Na Na told me you're a pro at making beds. Can you teach me?

554
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,099
All right, I'll make your bed.

555
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,339
Okay. I'll dig in.

556
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,600
You're leaving?

557
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,200
I already told A'Yao. I won't be volunteering here these days.

558
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,620
I'll take a couple of days off.

559
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,540
Y-You... Will you come back?

560
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,880
Yes. I'll definitely come back to visit you.

561
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,680
What about A'Yao?

562
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,579
A new volunteer will arrive soon. He'll be fine.

563
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:46,520
Are you ditching A'Yao?

564
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,900
Yeah, are you?

565
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,040
You...

566
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,999
Did you disinfect it?

567
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,079
Rest assured. All of these have been sterilized with alcohol.

568
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:08,779
We're only sending ten bottles to Hongdou's sister. Will these be enough?

569
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:11,900
We should send more if she likes this.

570
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,119
These will do for now. If she wants more, we'll send her more.

571
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,700
That's true.

572
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:24,280
Xiaochun told me that Hongdou's lease is ending, and she hasn't renewed it.

573
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,639
Yeah. She's going back to find a job.

574
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,420
What's going on between the two of you?

575
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,280
Hold on. So, is no one willing to believe our refutations of that rumor?

576
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,360
If that's what you're saying,

577
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,959
I'll get Xiaochun to find more people for your blind dates.

578
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,760
Look at me. Do I have time for a relationship?

579
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,739
Girls don't have time for relationships, either. They all date while working.

580
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,520
Someone is wooing Xiaochun.

581
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,799
Who is he?

582
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,720
A supplier.

583
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,979
He called her. I overheard him asking her out for a meal.

584
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,200
What did Xiaochun say? "I have no time!"

585
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,879
You know what? It's tiring to fetch water alone.

586
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:14,440
You need someone to share the burden with you.

587
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,320
Youngsters like you will regret this in the future.

588
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,100
Fill the wine.

589
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Come on.

Put it here, Granny.

You're treating me like a woman who just gave birth.

It'll get cold quickly. Here.

612

Tastes great. Okay, I've drunk it. Just leave it here.

613
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,639
You brought over such a big bowl of it. Do you think I'm a pig?

What nonsense is that?

615

You need to take care of your health.

That's not it. I just think it's a nice photo.

618

Cutie Pie has such charming, pearly eyes. Don't be mistaken.

619

Did I say anything? Caught you.

I'm up. I'll be right there.

644
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,840
Are we going to walk there?

645
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,220
Sure. Give me a second.

646
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,019
You're wearing a new shirt.

647
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,200
Nope. I bought it last year.

648
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,380
Take off the price tag.

653
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,159
You're wearing makeup for breakfast?

654
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,699
I... I'm not.

655
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:47,460
I just filled in my eyebrows, added some blush,

656
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,940
applied lipstick, and sprayed some perfume.

657
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,020
Did you remove the tag?

658
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,059
Do you want it?

659
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,200
Why would I want that?

660
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,520
Don't ask if you don't want it.

661
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,860
It's nothing embarrassing.

662
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,560
You know what?

663
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,519
One time, Chen Nanxing and I went shopping, and I bought a dress.

664
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,160
I wore it backward and went out.

665
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,359
Who noticed first?

666
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,680
My neck. It was so suffocating.

667
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,380
So, you did something so stupid before?

668
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
You're using cologne?

669
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,599
It's honey body wash. You have the nose of a dog.

670
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,540
It smells pretty nice. What brand is it?

671
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,019
An old domestic brand. It's very cheap.

♫ <i>Sometimes I find I fall in love</i> ♫

♫ <i>Maybe things will go your way</i> ♫

677
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,620
At the market, I saw Hongdou and A'Yao eating rice noodles.

678
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,200
They were really chummy.

679
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,759
Two nights ago, I went to play Mahjong at A'Yao's place,

680
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:23,519
I saw them together. They were pretty close.

681
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,060
Let's not make wild guesses.

682
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,480
Hongdou has stopped her volunteer work.

683
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,980
Besides, she didn't renew her lease.

684
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,020
Yeah. From what A'Yao told me, I doubt it'll work out between them.

685
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,120
We've all been there.

686
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,240
These are just their cheap tricks.

687
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,450
Won't work out? Who the heck would believe that?

688
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,520
Let's put it this way.

689
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,220
They like each other, but they're not in the right place.

690
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,540
Hongdou is bound to head back to Beijing.

691
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,460
She can't get used to life here?

692
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,619
Not really. Hongdou is just having a vacation here, and she isn't staying for long.

693
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,860
So, our place isn't part of her life plans. Got it?

694
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,650
Yeah. She can't get used to living here.

695
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,699
It's not that.

696
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,959
Their relationship hasn't developed to the point that she'll consider

697
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,220
whether she'll get used to life here.

698
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,600
Well, let it develop.

699
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,100
There isn't any room for progress.

700
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,060
So, she can't adjust to life here?

701
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,640
No, that's not the point! Can't you understand?

702
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,839
Hongdou comes from a big city.

703
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,939
How could she settle down in a village?

704
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,440
Doesn't that mean she can't adapt to life here?

705
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,860
Yeah, you're right. She can't get used to this place.

706
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,079
What a single-tracked mind.

707
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,900
Have another piece of meat.
