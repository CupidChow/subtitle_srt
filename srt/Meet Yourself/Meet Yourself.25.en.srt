00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,100
<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
What are you watching?

4
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,500
Why are you laughing so happily?

5
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,300
Am I disturbing you?

6
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,800
No. Not at all. I'm finished with this.

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm just checking it again.

8
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,900
Why aren't Hongdou and Old Hu back yet?

9
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,400
The singer at the town's bar left,

10
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,600
so Mr. Hu went for an audition today.

11
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Hongdou is probably playing Mahjong at Chairman Xie's house.

12
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,100
Lately, Granny Xie has been hooked on Mahjong.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,500
This progress bar is too slow.

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,700
What progress bar?

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
The progress bar of love.

16
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,679
There's no such thing between them.

17
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,800
Hongdou's time here is two short, only two or three months.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Once she leaves, they'll return to their separate lives.

19
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Romance isn't possible between them.

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
That's not right.

21
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,700
I doubt this is related to time.

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,800
Hongdou won't further her career here.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Marriage these days aren't like in old times,

24
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
when where the needle goes, the thread follows.

25
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,300
A girl has to be thorough with her considerations.

26
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
That's right.

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
A career should be her first priority.

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Exactly. Career comes first.

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
When you have your career,

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,900
you can pursue other joys.

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
That's easy to say.

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
But, Xiao Huang,

33
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,100
you've come here to work for ages.

34
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,900
Why haven't you found a boyfriend here?

35
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,600
I have a boyfriend.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
He's a teacher in Guizhou.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
We started dating last month.

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
How did you find time to date someone in Guizhou?

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Last summer, I went to Guizhou to visit my parents.

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
My mom already told me before I left.

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Their new volunteer teacher is my type.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
They praised him to the heavens.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
When I arrived and met him,

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
he was truly a gentleman.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He speaks tenderly and has a dependable disposition.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Most importantly, he'll be shy if you look at him for too long.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
His face was bright red.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,500
My mom knows my preference really well.

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,000
I can't believe your mom introduced him to you.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I had a good impression of him, so we kept in touch.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,900
We decided to confess our feelings last month

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
and became a couple.

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,200
So, you're having a long-distance online relationship.

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
I have an idea in my head right now.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I want him to poach him from my mom.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Our school is also short of teachers.

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,900
Is he willing to come over?

58
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,800
He... He's reluctant at the moment.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,500
Let your mom talk to him.

60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,800
My mom is even more reluctant.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,300
My mom told me this.

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
His current students are going to take the high school entrance examinations.

63
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,600
She told me to ditch this idea for good.

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Your family is hilarious.

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,300
My mom's the only joker.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Xiao Qin runs the sundry store,

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
but it doesn't have many customers.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,200
My guess is that the store won't last long.

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Besides, the boy she likes doesn't have a decent job.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
Her parents must be worried sick about her.

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
Worrying is pointless.

72
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,200
Parents can't make decisions for their children.

73
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,650
Xiao Qin's dad even asked about Xia Xia.

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,189
Why did he ask about Xia Xia?

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
He's fond of Xia Xia.

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
He thinks Xia Xia is a skilled boy.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
How can he even be fond of Xia Xia?

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
A few years ago, he despised us for being poor.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
That was a few years ago.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Things are different now.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Xia Xia is a skilled craftsman, and we know him well. Right?

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
If there's a nice girl, we have to introduce her to Xia Xia at once.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Xia Xia is still young.

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,200
A'Yao should be our priority.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,600
We don't need to worry about A'Yao.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Xiaochun is making efforts.

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I heard that Xiaochun got acquainted

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,300
with the pretty female owner of a restaurant in town.

89
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,800
She's going to introduce her to A'Yao.

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Aunty A'Gui, don't just chat.

91
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Play your tiles.

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,500
Three characters.

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
Xiaochun mentioned this at home.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
A'Yao, what do you think?

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,300
I oppose.

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,800
I already told her to focus on her job instead of doing such things.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Can't you just meet that girl?

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
That's not it.

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Can Xiaochun channel her energy into her work?

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
She's already so busy with work.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Why does she have the time to waste on such nonsense?

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
This is an important matter. Don't you agree?

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Exactly.

104
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,800
Aunty, you need to reason with him.

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,300
You can reason with him if you want to.

106
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,000
I have no control over him.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
He has already given the ultimatum.

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,300
Accept reality and give up on these fantasies.

109
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,220
What's this about accepting reality and giving up on fantasies?

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Why did you kick me?

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I-I have long legs.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,100
Don't peek at my tiles!

113
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,300
We're like a bunch of backseat drivers offering unsolicited advice.

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,400
A'Yao doesn't even appreciate our kindness.

115
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,600
Hongdou, what do you think about A'Yao?

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,300
He's pretty nice.

117
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm asking if he's your type.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
Nope.

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Why not?

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,500
I prefer someone fairer.

121
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Don't peek at my tiles.

122
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
I didn't.

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,100
Xiaochun, we're here.

124
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,700
Hongdou!

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,500
You...

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
Why are you here?

127
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,600
Didn't you invite Hongdou over for a meal?

128
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,400
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I decided to join in.

129
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,100
What's wrong?

130
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800
Are there secrets you want to share with her that I can't know about?

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
That's not it.

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
We're having a girls' talk. Don't be nosy.

133
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,800
Go back to the cafe. Get Na Na to make a potato pancake for you.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Are you really going to shoo me away?

135
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,100
Xiaochun!

136
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you standing at the door?

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm coming.

138
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Hurry on in.

139
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, join us if you want to.

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go, Hongdou. Let's go.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Xie Xiaochun, mind your attitude!

142
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Let me introduce her to you.

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,500
This is the owner of the restaurant, Xiaowei.

144
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
This is my good friend, Xu Hongdou.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

146
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,300
This is my big brother, Xie Zhiyao.

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,700
Glad to meet you.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Chairman Xie, you found time to come over today?

149
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
He has some time today.

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Let's sit in the yard. It's more convenient to chat.

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Okay. Let's go.

153
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,800
Let's go, Hongdou.

154
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Feel free to order whatever you want.

155
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
Be my guest.

156
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Lunch is on me today.

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,600
I've been keen on inviting Xiaochun over for a meal,

158
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,500
but she's been busy.

159
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,200
I can't let you pay for this meal.

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,700
Hongdou has been here for so long, and she'll be leaving soon,

161
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,000
but I haven't even treated her to a meal.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
So, I should pay for this meal.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Hongdou, don't you work here?

164
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,400
No, I don't.

165
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm here for vacation, and a tenant

166
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,700
at Chairman Xie's courtyard.

167
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,700
So, will this be a farewell meal?

168
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,200
Is it really okay for me to join in?

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes, it's totally fine.

170
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't worry. It's just a meal.

171
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Well, your drinks are on me.

172
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,600
I have a nice bottle of red wine here. We can open it today.

173
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
- I'll go get it.
- No, there's no need!

174
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Xiaowei, you're too courteous!

175
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
She's a born socializer, isn't she?

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Hey, Brother.

177
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,800
Have you forgotten everything I told you?

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
What?

179
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,200
Didn't I tell you about Sun Xiaowei,

180
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
the owner of a fusion cuisine restaurant?

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
I even said I wanted to introduce her to you.

182
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,900
He rejected me.

183
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
But I couldn't tell her the truth.

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
I told her you were too busy.

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,300
When you're free, you'd definitely pop by.

186
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,200
Why are you staring at me?

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,600
I didn't ask you to come.

188
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
You invited yourself.

189
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Well... I'll get going.

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Why are you leaving now?

191
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
I let you leave just now,

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
but you refused.

193
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Are you guys ready to order?

194
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,200
We'll get a beef burger and a salami pancake, okay?

195
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
- What about you, Hongdou?
- A chicken burrito.

196
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,100
Sure.

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I... I am okay with anything.

198
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Okay. Give me a moment. I'll inform the kitchen.

199
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Okay.

200
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,189
- Cheers!
- I'm really glad.

201
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Indeed.

202
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,999
Xiaochun told me that you were busy,

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,800
so I was considering making a trip to your horse ranch for horseriding.

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,600
My restaurant just opened its doors, so I didn't manage to go.

205
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
We're all busy.

206
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
All the neighboring shops know about Chairman Xie.

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,000
They say he's a successful and dashing young man.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
He's even a kind-hearted person.

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
That's an exaggeration.

210
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
Don't listen to their nonsense.

211
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
That isn't nonsense.

212
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,400
I can verify that you're as handsome as they describe.

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
But why don't you have a girlfriend?

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
Well, he's an unearthed pearl.

215
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,600
He devotes all his energy to his career.

216
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
An unearthed pearl?

217
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,200
At first, I shared the same thought.

218
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,800
I soon found out that wasn't the truth.

219
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,700
He has high standards when choosing a partner.

220
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
He'd rather wait for the perfect match,

221
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
unlike some other men

222
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,800
who yearns for more when they are already attached.

223
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
He's not like that.

224
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm not that virtuous.

225
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
It's just that no one likes me.

226
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,200
Let's not talk about this. Come on. Bottoms up!

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
Cheers.

228
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,800
- Bottoms up?
- I'll down this.

229
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Why didn't you help me?

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
I've done all I could.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Everything I said about you were compliments.

232
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I said you were righteous and filial.

233
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,500
Are you helping me or trying to get me attached?

234
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,400
Xiao Wei assumed you were here for a blind date anyway.

235
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,100
You shouldn't have gone along with her words.

236
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,700
I tried my best to divert the topic,

237
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
but you went back to it.

238
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
Well, Xiao Wei's questions were no big deal.

239
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Since she asked me, I had to answer.

240
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Great.

241
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Now, she thinks I'm eager to come for this blind date with her.

242
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
I even brought along two sliver-tongued helpers.

243
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Xiaochun's attempts are enough.

244
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
Why are you...

245
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,500
Are you that eager for me to date someone?

246
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,400
No, that's not what I meant.

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Why is Xiaochun so slow?

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,000
- I have something on. I can't wait any longer.
- Bye.

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Fine.

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
<i>Thank you.</i>

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Hongdou.

252
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Where's Brother?

253
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
He left for work.

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
Why did he leave so quickly?

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm so sorry.

256
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
I thought this restaurant's ambiance was nice, so I wanted to bring you here.

257
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,800
- I didn't expect...
- The food was delicious.

258
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,900
Where are you headed?

259
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm going back to the warehouse. What about you?

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll visit Granny Xie.

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's go together.

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Have you eaten?

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I feel a little sleepy.

265
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,700
Come on.

266
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Sit here.

267
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,200
Why are you sighing?

268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,400
What's bothering you?

269
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I feel a little confused.

270
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,600
You have too much on your mind.

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Troubles compound the more you think about them.

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Granny, why are people like bears stealing corn?

273
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Grabbing a new ear of corn means losing the previous one.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Why can't we have it all?

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
You can't be too greedy.

276
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,000
When you have a thousand bucks, you covet ten thousand more.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,400
When you become the emperor, you yearn to be god.

278
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,300
A man only has two hands.

279
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,200
No matter how much wealth is before you,

280
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,800
you can only take what fits in your hands.

281
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
If you take the gold and silver bracelets,

282
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
you won't be able to hold the jade one.

283
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,000
How can you have everything you want?

284
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
We can't have everything we want.

285
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
I got it.

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,600
When will you leave?

287
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
In a few days.

288
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Well, come over for meals more often.

289
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,300
I'd love to.

290
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Granny, I think you smell like my grandma.

291
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
What do I smell like?

292
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
The smell of baked bread.

293
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,300
That's the smell of burning firewood.

294
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Granny, you must stay healthy.

295
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Listen to A'Yao.

296
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,000
Visit the hospital if you feel unwell.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
Don't refuse to see a doctor because you don't want to trouble others.

298
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,400
I got it.

299
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,800
I have a few words of advice for you, too.

300
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Don't be too uptight.

301
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,100
Be embracing.

302
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,300
Troubles will only multiple as you worry more.

303
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,400
Everything will pass somehow.

304
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,900
I'll keep this in mind.

I should be the one apologizing.

You don't have to.

It's fine. This is the new tradition of the courtyard.

465
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:57,069
Your room is on the second floor.

466
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,480
Be careful. The stairs are a little steep.

467

- It's fine. It's not that heavy.

469
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,300
Watch your step. The stairs are narrow.

470
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,280
This courtyard is pretty large.

471
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,199
It's not a specific housing land.

472
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,250
Three houses are combined to form this place.

473
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,780
Initially, the place was rented out as an inn,

474
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,300
but that went out of business.

475
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,200
It was left idle for three years.

476
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,509
Chairman Xie found a designer to renovate the whole place again.

477
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,920
Now, it's used for short-term rentals.

478
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,479
There are six rooms here.

479
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,010
That's a communal area downstairs.

480
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,970
Let me show you to your room.

481
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,400
Okay.

482
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,840
Here you go.

483
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,899
The cleaning lady tidied your room before you came.

484
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,520
The windows were opened for ventilation.

485
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,349
All the electrical appliances have been checked

486
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,310
and there are no problems.

487
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,999
However, the cleaning lady

488
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,490
only cleans the communal area.

489
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,789
You have to tidy up the room yourself.

490
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,949
If you want her help with cleaning, that'll be an extra fee.

491
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,461
Got it.

492
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:08,749
By the way, there's a huge temperature difference between day and night.

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,509
There are many mosquitoes and insects at night.

494
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,279
I'll get you the pesticide later. You can spray it in your room.

495
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,509
I have it in my room. You don't need to buy it.

496
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:16,200
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

497
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,719
Are you the housekeeper here?

498
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,399
No, I'm not.

499
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,069
I'm a neighboring tenant.

500
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm just doing a favor.

501
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,109
You're a tenant as well?

502
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,220
Yes.

503
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,280
If you didn't say so,

504
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,200
I would've assumed you were a long-term resident here.

505
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,550
Why do you say so?

506
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,400
You seem very comfortable here.

507
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
I'm leaving in a couple of days but I'll still be around for now.

508
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,750
If you need anything, just ask me.

509
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,540
What a pity.

510
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,880
I just got here but you're leaving.

511
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,910
Our meeting right now is already a form of serendipity.

512
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,210
You're right.

513
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,069
Let me introduce myself.

514
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,930
My name is Bai Manjun.

515
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,010
You can call me Sister Manjun.

516
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,659
Sister Manjun. I'm Xu Hongdou.

517
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,490
- Glad to meet you.
- Glad to meet you, too.

518
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,140
I'll leave you to unpack your luggage.

519
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,969
Xiaochun will come over later. She said she wants to have lunch with you.

520
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,210
Okay.

521
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,479
Feel free to look for me if you need anything.

522
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,200
Sure. Thanks a lot.

523
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,300
It's nothing.

524
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
Xu Hongdou!

525
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,380
How are you feeling?

526
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,110
I'm fine.

527
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,919
When are you heading off for the IV drip?

528
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,030
4:00.

529
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,790
I'll go with you.

530
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,210
Okay.

531
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,900
Hongdou, why did you come back by yourself?

532
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,150
Where's Chairman Xie?

533
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,399
Xinxin called him.

534
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,639
She asked him to make a trip to the village committee

535
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,510
to mediate between some villagers.

536
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,360
Wait a moment.

537
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,580
Was the tenant you picked up

538
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
a pretty lady?

539
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,589
How about this?

540
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,239
Since you know her,

541
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,959
go upstairs and invite her down later.

542
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,060
I'll sit here

543
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,069
and play my guitar with my back facing her.

544
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,139
That'll seem really enthralling. All right?

545
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,179
- Okay.
- Thank you.

546
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,010
I'll go get her.

547
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,580
Relax.

548
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,550
Don't be nervous.

549
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
How do I look?

550
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,780
Sister Manjun.

551
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,580
Are you free at the moment? Come downstairs and hang out with us.

552
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,780
Sure.

553
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,959
Are you done unpacking?

554
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,590
Yes. I didn't bring much.

555
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,959
You can head down first.

556
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,199
I'll change my clothes.

557
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,580
Okay.

558
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,690

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,670
<i>Mom, what's wrong?</i>

587
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,069
<i>I'm in Beijing.</i>

588
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,420
<i>There's a music festival.</i>

589

<i>I'm not at a bar. It's a music festival. Listen.</i>

590
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,430
<i>Sir!</i>

591
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,069
<i>- Get me another cup.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

592
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:13,629
<i>Talk to you another time. Bye-bye.</i>

593
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,220

594
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,210
<i>Goodbye.</i>

595
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,580
<i>You!</i>

596
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,590
<i>Here's your cup.</i>

597
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,839
<i>I'll buy you a drink.</i>

598
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,879
<i>No, it's too late.</i>

599
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,590
<i>I won't drink.</i>

600
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,759
<i>It's so late now.</i>

601
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,830
<i>Why are you drinking a double-shot expresso?</i>

602
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,270
<i>Come over.</i>

603
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,660
<i>Chat with me.</i>

604
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,150
Alright.

605
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,210
<i>We may be strangers,</i>

606
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,710
<i>but you seem like you're in a terrible mood.</i>

607
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,479
<i>Just treat me as a trashcan.</i>

608
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,710
<i>Hurl whatever's on your mind at me.</i>

609
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,100
<i>It's fine. I have a steel heart.</i>

610
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,860
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

611
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,730
<i>Where's my bag?</i>

612
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,720
<i>The divorce certificate</i>

613
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,170
<i>of the People's Republic of China.</i>

614
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,730
<i>I've never even seen a marriage certificate,</i>

615
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,700
<i>but I'm setting eyes on a divorce certificate first.</i>

616
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,070
<i>Don't they look very similar?</i>

617
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,259
<i>Almost the same.</i>

618
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,200
<i>Almost.</i>

619
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,660
<i>If you're in this state,</i>

620
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,460
<i>did your husband...</i>

621
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,779
<i>your ex-husband cheat on you?</i>

622
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:45,610
<i>Nope.</i>

623
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,770
<i>Well, did you cheat on him?</i>

624
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,650
<i>I don't have the time for that.</i>

625
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,549
<i>I need to take care of my family,</i>

626
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,010
<i>my daughter, my ex-husband, and my mother-in-law.</i>

627
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,040
<i>So, you lived with your mother-in-law?</i>

628
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,999
<i>You didn't get along with her?</i>

629
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,370
<i>Nope.</i>

630
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,029
<i>My mother-in-law lives above us.</i>

631
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,900
<i>She's very nice.</i>

632
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,439
<i>Actually, I married my ex-husband</i>

633
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,090
<i>because I thought my mother-in-law was nice.</i>

634
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,980
<i>In that case,</i>

635
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,749
<i>your ex-husband must've treated you poorly.</i>

636
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:20,570
<i>You should get a divorce.</i>

637
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,820
<i>That's not it either.</i>

638
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,190
<i>My parents can't even find any flaws with him.</i>

639
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,370
<i>Well, what's the reason?</i>

640
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,510
<i>Since everything seems well and merry, why the divorce?</i>

641
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,030
<i>I don't get it.</i>

642
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,190
<i>You don't need to understand.</i>

643
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,950
<i>Cheers.</i>

644
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,919
<i>Miss... you shouldn't drink too much.</i>

645
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,219
<i>Stop drinking.</i>

646
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:41,250
<i>Cheers.</i>

647
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,390

648
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,690

I saw her in a bad mood, so I went to console her.

660
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,720
It was a force of habit.

661
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,050
Thank you for not treating me like a hooligan.

662
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,160
Mr. Hu might seem roguish,

663
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,590
but he's a kind-hearted person.

664
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,780
That's true. He told me that if I needed a break to cheer up,

665
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,090
I can come here.

666
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,659
That's because the people here are very nice.

667
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,980
Yes, everyone is great.

668
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,960
But I didn't expect you to come.

669
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,020
Right? You didn't even leave me your phone number.

670
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,540
I can search for this place online.

671
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,150
What a pity.

672
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,129
You should've told Xiaochun that you're my friend,

673
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,819
and I invited you to come here.

674
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,779
She'd have given you a discount on the rent.

675
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,060
Really?

676
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,769
Mr. Hu, you didn't even get a discount for your own rent. Right?

677
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,620
You must've been an excavator in your past life.

678
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,170
All you know is sabotage and destruction.

679
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,500
Sister Manjun, have some fruit.

680
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,120
Thanks.

681
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,319
I dare you to say that again!

682
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,439
You stole my corn!

683
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,940
- Shameless!
- Those belong to me!

684
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,319
Don't fight!

685
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,409
Don't fight here!

686
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:44,630
Stop!

687
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,799
- Uncle!
- Stop it!

688
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,439
- Uncle!
- Stop fighting!

689
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,050
Uncle!

690
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,230
What happened to you?

691
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,509
The villagers were having a fight.

692
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,789
I didn't have any hair for them to yank, so they ripped my clothes.

693
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,049
You're bleeding from scratches.

694
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,270
Where?

695
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,030
Your neck.

696
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,790
That'll get infected.

697
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,600
Come upstairs.

698
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,610
Let it down.

699
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,940
What?

700
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,060
Let your hair down so I can climb up.

701
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,130
Spin your own thread.

702
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,730
<i>Come in.</i>

703
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,940
Are you packing your luggage?

704
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,300
<i>Wait a second. I'm looking for iodine.</i>

705
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,530
Found it.

706
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,340
Hold on.

707
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,100
Let me have a look.

708
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,819
His nails sure are sharp.

709
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,129
If those scratches were on your face, you'd be disfigured.

710
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,190
You didn't see his nails in person.

711
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,989
They've turned brown from smoking, and it's all black under his nails.

712
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,589
Just tend the wound. Don't breathe on my neck.

713
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,959
Sorry. I did that subconsciously.

714
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,810
It's fine.

715
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,350
Keep going.

716
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,150
