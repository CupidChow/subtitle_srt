3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,779
We'll just peek for a bit. Be quiet.

4
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:39,039
Don't let Xie Qiang see us.

5
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,559
What if he notices us?

6
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,739
We can't be seen. If he sees us, that's bad luck for us.

7
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,179
Who told you that?

8
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,219
Zhang Xuefeng and the other people said so.

9
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,439
Don't listen to Zhang Xuefeng's nonsense.

10
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,179
My granny told me that Xie Qiang only dislikes naughty kids.

11
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,819
I'm scared. I don't want to see him.

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,259
We're men.

13
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,419
Since we're here, we can't cower back.

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,179
That's right, we're men.

15
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,919
Xiao Hu Lu, are you scared?

16
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,419
Of course not.

17
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,839
I'm a woman.

18
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:11,360
Mom always says women need to be strong.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,880
Don't be scared. Just follow me.

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,239
Which one is Xie Qiang?

21
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,400
The tallest, strongest, and most powerful one.

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,580
- A'Qiang is back.
- Let him raise a toast to you.

23
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,119
I can see my dad.

24
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,220
Sister Hongdou and Uncle A'Yao are here, too.

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,919
He should be at the table next to theirs. The one full of guys.

26
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,060
A'Qiang,

27
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,440
you have to be filial to your parents.

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't let them down again.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,880
Do you know how they lived during these years?

30
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,379
They scrimped and saved every cent.

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,940
All they thought about was earning money.

32
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,920
Do you know?

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,980
Your dad was sent to the hospital because of anemia.

34
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,499
Let's not talk about that.

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,720
Everyone falls ill, right?

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,899
A'Qiang, drink a toast to them.

37
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,020
I haven't finished yet.

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,220
A'Qiang, you've been reformed in the prison for years.

39
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,900
We believe that you're a good man now.

40
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,260
We hope you can turn over a new leaf.

41
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,739
Everyone makes mistakes.

42
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,060
It's fine as long as you correct them.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,279
We are only worried that your hands will grow restless

44
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,580
and get addicted to stealing.

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,940
I'll be back real quick.

46
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,580
Come on, uncles.

47
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,339
A'Qiang has drunk too much. I'll drink this toast for him.

48
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,160
You?

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,519
We're childhood friends.

50
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,819
Aunty Feng has cooked for me tons of times as a kid.

51
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,860
Well, don't you think I can drink on his behalf?

52
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,139
Y-Yes.

53
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,719
Come on.

54
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,400
Cheers.

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,880
Come on. Let me fill your cups.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
Here you go.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,460
Thank you.

58
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,020
He was young and took the wrong path,

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,000
but he's learned from his mistake.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,200
It's hard to avoid stumbling in life.

61
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,379
As the ancient saying goes,

62
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,419
"A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold."

63
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,479
Let's leave the past behind us. We shouldn't talk about it again.

64
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,660
Talking about it is pointless anyway.

65
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,880
I know that you hope the best for him,

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,839
but strangers might think you're gossiping about your own family.

67
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,599
We can't let them think we're fools. Right?

68
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,499
That's right.

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,019
We're just offering kind words to him.

70
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,959
That's right. We won't talk about this again.

71
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,339
- Okay, we won't.
- We won't.

72
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,419
- You won't, right?
- Exactly.

73
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:06,579
- Great!
- Thank you so much.

74
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,339
Let's share a drink on this wonderful day!

75
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,959
- Come on.
- Cheers!

76
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,259
Thank you so much.

77
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,939
- Come on.
- I see him! The one who stood up!

78
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,919
That must be him! He's Xie Qiang!

79
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,960
He's really tall and strong.

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,380
Come on.

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,680
Help yourselves. Enjoy yourselves.

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,919
Xiao Hu Lu.

83
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,219
Have you kiddos had lunch?

84
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,579
- Oh, no!
- Run!

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,360
Why are they running?

86
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,479
Ignore them. They're having fun.

87
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,100
Let's continue.

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,580
<i>Run!</i>

89
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,100
- I'll have to slow down on the drinks.
- Take your time.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,140
Drink less.

91
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,039
How could he expose us? He's so annoying!

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,160
You guys! Xiao Hu Lu!

93
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Xiao Hu Lu, come home for lunch! Stop there!

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,380
Aunty Feng's relatives are really good at drinking.

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,060
Hongdou!

96
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,820
Wait for a second!

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,000
Here you go.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
These aren't leftovers.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,499
They're for his granny. Thank you, Aunty Feng.

100
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,580
Damai!

101
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,319
You seemed to like the beef.

102
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,500
Take this back for dinner with Na Na.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,240
Thank you so much, Aunty Feng.

104
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,660
I should thank you guys.

105
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,240
You've helped us a lot!

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
Is he fine?

107
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,479
We'll make some soup to help him sober up.

108
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,319
You can head back.

109
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,580
He drank quite a bit.

110
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,639
We're heading off.

111
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,860
- Goodbye, Aunty Feng.
- Take care!

112
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,939
Okay. Let me carry that.

113
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,000
Make him some tea.

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,839
<i>Okay. Don't forget to hire me next time.</i>

115
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,379
<i>I promise we will.</i>

116
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,539
<i>You cook so well.</i>

117
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,940
<i>Thank you.</i>

118
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,759
<i>Let me see him off.</i>

119
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,259
<i>You're too polite.</i>

120
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,860
<i>It's fine.</i>

121
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,640

Sit down.

Mom, don't cry.

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm back.

128

My son.

129
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,800
I've let you down, Mom.

Sobered up?

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,200
Are you thirsty?

147
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,420
Let me take a look.

148
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,620
Your face is still hot.

149
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,259
You're so marvelous.

150
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,540
You can't stand anyone drinking more than you, can you?

151
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,720
Don't you feel sick?

152
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,519
I'm fine. Just a little woozy.

153
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,400
Where's Granny?

154
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,660
I asked her to go to bed.

155
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,820
Your dinner is in the pot.

156
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,800
Sorry for letting you look after a drunkard.

157
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,660
You're decent.

158
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,379
Not a terrible drunkard.

159
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,179
You just get sleepy when you're drunk.

160
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,820
You don't vomit or throw fits.

161
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,480
But you need to know you aren't young anymore.

162
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,680
So, cut down on alcohol. You can't be so extreme.

163
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
Your health will be ruined.

164
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,300
Not young anymore? I'm in my prime, okay?

165
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,799
After a little alcohol, your face was burning like a steamed bun.

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,500
Are you really in your prime?

167
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Don't you think so?

168
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,300
Tired?

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,400
- What are you doing?
- Accounts.

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,840
Everything needs money.

171
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,079
Recently, I've finally understood the meaning of spending money like flowing water.

172
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,820
Everything just gushes away.

173
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,220
If you do well, it could be a windfall.

174
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,510
Everything gushing in.

175
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,539
May your blessings come true.

176
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,099
Thanks for taking care of me.

177
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,290
Let me repay this kindness.

178
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,210
I'll give you a relaxing massage.

179
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,420
Aren't you tired?

180
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,219
Nope. Lean back.

181
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,519
You should rest!

182
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm fine. Come on.

183

♫ <i>I've been alone</i> ♫

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,210
Comfortable?

185
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't wear yourself out.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,140
Tell me if you need my help.

A'Yao, do you know

189
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,940
the difference between fatigues?

190
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,340
They aren't the same. There's a type of fatigue

191
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,859
which is like being trapped in an endless desert.

192
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,679
You know?

193
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,440
There's another type that is akin to traversing mountains.

194
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,320
That's really fun.

195
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,800
So, are you having fun now?

Where did you go?

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,939
I went to the farm and picked some vegetables.

202
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,079
Change your clothes right away. I'll take you out.

Where to?

204
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,959
To watch a performance. Let's go!

205
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,299
You have to come along.

206
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,019
Do you expect me to chat with your parents alone?

207
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,239
Yanran's mom, you're here. Please get on the bus.

208
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:21,339
Selling water purifiers? Is this the time for that?

209
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,020
I'll help you sell 10 sets, okay?

210
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,679
Okay, fine. I'm hanging up.

211
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,740
We didn't quarrel.

212
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,600
What's going on?

213
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,059
Aren't you performing today? You should be happy. Right?

214
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,260
Xiao Hu Lu's mom. Please get on.

215
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,860
Okay.

216
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,060
Be careful.

217
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,139
We didn't quarrel. Okay?

218
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,459
- Ms. Zhang.
- Mr. Hu, you're here.

219
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,699
- Are there seats left?
- Yes.

220
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,020
Okay.

221
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,360
By the way, she's my friend.

222
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,200
She'll help with recording the performance.

223
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,859
Hop on then.

224
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,680
Okay, we'll take this bus.

225
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,660
Come on.

226
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,939
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Hu!

227
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,719
Mr. Hu! Sit with me!

228
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,039
Sit with you?

229
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,499
Where are your parents?

230
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,859
They went out and my grandparents can't come.

231
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,300
Just sit here.

232
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,880
Sit down.

233
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
Sister Manjun, come over here!

234
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,219
I'll sit with Xiaochun.

235
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,159
- Take your seat.
- Sure.

236
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,740
Sit with them.

237
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,960
Come on.

238
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,939
I'll sit with you.

239
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,119
Xiao Hu Lu! Who is she?

240
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,939
Aunty.

241
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,260
That's right.

242
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,039
Have you fastened your seat belts?

243
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,799
<i>Yes!</i>

244
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,519
Okay, let's set off!

245
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,739
Have you fastened your seat belt?

246
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,619
Yes.

247
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,680
Sir, close the door.

248
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,759
Let's go. Watch your step.

249
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,640
Slow down.

250
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,220
Let me show you.

251
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,779
Press this to turn it on.

252
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,539
Now, it's on. Press this to record.

253
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,939
Look, it's recording.

254
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,680
It has an auto-focus.

255
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,939
I get it. Let me try.

256
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,300
Xiao Hu Lu. Xiao Hu Lu!

257

Hi!

258
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,120
Hello!

259
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,200
Let me help you.

260
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,820
All done.

261
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,660
Not bad.

262
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,460
I'll take my seat.

263
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,520
Mr. Hu.

264
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,179
Is she just a good friend? I bet she's your girlfriend.

293
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,140
What about tomorrow?

294
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,299
Sure. 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

295
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,900
Is that okay?

296
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,339
Okay, it's settled then.

297
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,800
See you tomorrow.

298
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,360
Bye.

299
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Xiaochun.

300
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,200
Mr. Hu.

301
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,580
I need to tell you something.

302
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,340
Don't scold me because you think I'm meddlesome.

303
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,599
I noticed that Xiao Hu Lu's grandparents came.

304
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,060
So, I think I have to tell you this.

305
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,000
Speak your mind.

306
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,460
It's about Xiao Hu Lu's education.

307
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,419
I know very little about education and I'm not a real teacher,

308
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,159
but I need to get this off my mind by telling you.

309
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,419
So, I insist on telling you.

310
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,999
Can you please stop this nonsense? Cut to the chase.

311
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,680
Haven't you noticed?

312
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,600
Xiao Hu Lu has been feeling down today.

313
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,959
I did, but it's because she isn't standing in the middle.

314
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,499
Kids just want to shine. I get it.

315
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,960
Look at you!

316
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,140
That's just the typical mindset of adults.

317
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,240
What is Xiao Hu Lu thinking?

318
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,659
She thinks the middle is the best.

319
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,779
If she can't be the best, her grandparents will complain

320
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,740
the school here is bad and you can't educate her well.

321
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,780
She can't study here anymore.

322
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,820
She doesn't just want to be better than others.

323
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,500
She's just scared of parting from you.

324
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,160
Xiao Hu Lu, have some vegetables.

325
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,579
Make sure you have balanced nutrition.

326
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,019
Thank you, Grandpa.

327
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,940
Good girl.

328
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,400
Who said you're a fussy eater?

329
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,500
You aren't picky at all.

330
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,899
Grandma, my mom cooks yummy food for me every day.

331
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,859
She even reads me stories and teaches me to read.

332
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,480
Really? How many words do you know?

333
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,140
So many!

334
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,580
I didn't stand in the middle today because I'm too tall.

335
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,780
Having someone tall in the middle is quite disruptive.

336
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,020
Yes!

337
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,679
When you study in Kunming, Grandma will cook yummy food every day.

338
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,260
I'll read you stories, too.

339
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,460
Dad, I can agree with you on other things

340
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,039
except for Xiao Hu Lu's education. We should discuss this again.

341
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,719
This can't be negotiated.

342
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,140
She must study in Kunming.

343
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,179
We can't impede her education.

344
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,480
We can't go with your decision on this.

345
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,140
Here's my plan.

346
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,979
She can study elementary school here and attend junior high in Kunming.

347
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,840
Won't she fall behind others?

348
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,100
Others already have a good head start.

349
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,620
If you insist on talking about head start,

350
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,360
I reckon parents are the starting line for their children.

351
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,139
After graduation, I started a small business and Luo Quan sold water purifiers.

352
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:20,240
We could only provide her with very little.

353
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,659
So, I think the best thing we can offer her right now

354
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,440
is a happy childhood and an unconstrained future.

355
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,620
What are you even saying?

356
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,380
Unconstrained?

357
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,459
Xiao Hu Lu is so smart. She's bound to surpass both of you.

358
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,080
Are you giving up on your child because you're incapable?

359
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,060
How aren't I nurturing her?

360
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,680
I've already sent her to school.

361
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,500
What else do you want?

362
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,490
Must she attend extra classes to learn instruments and painting?

363
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,699
Must she study hard enough to win the Math Olympiad? Is this your concept of nurturing a child?

364
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,920
Everyone lets their kids pick up the arts.

365
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,240
She can. Our village is so cultured and artistic.

366
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,439
I can let her learn embroidery, tie-dye, or carving.

367
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,119
Recently, two painters visited our village.

368
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,160
If necessary, I can introduce Xiao Hu Lu to them.

369
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,479
Lower your voice. We're outside.

370
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,740
Don't disturb others.

371
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,560
That's right.

372
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,380
Xiaochun, what did we agree on?

373
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,420
Yes, I remember.

374
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,079
We did make a collective decision.

375
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,800
However, we have to change according to her.

376
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,680
She'll be useless if she grows up with you!

377
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,840
What do you mean by that?

378
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,100
She has a great habit of reading

379
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,280
and a strong thirst for knowledge.

380
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,820
She's brave, kind, caring, loyal, and polite.

381
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,920
Do you know what her biggest dream is?

382
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
She wants to be an astronaut.

383
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,380
Is that being useless to you?

384
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,860
Don't quarrel outside.

385
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,940
Are you really a dad?

386
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,200
There's no point of having you around. Fence-sitter.

387
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,620
Stop eating. Let's go home.

388
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,779
Enjoy the meal, Mom. Call me if necessary.

389
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,200
Come on. Take your spoon.

390
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,860
The spoon!

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,360
Xiaochun.

392
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,460
I told you that you can't win her in a quarrel.

393
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,719
We weren't quarreling. I was just stating facts.

394
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,959
Dad, Xiaochun was also stating facts.

395
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,920
Shut up.

396
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,960
She's right. You're so useless.

397
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,900
Just a fence-sitter.

398
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,120
Mom, do you want some?

399
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,620
No, thanks. Enjoy it yourself.

400
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,860
Hu Lu, I want to ask you something.

401
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,500
- Am I fierce?
- Yeah.

402
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,460
Really?

403
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,480
What do you hope for me to be like?

404
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,080
Tell me and I'll change.

405
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,300
I want you to be happy.

406
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,220
What else?

407
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,299
Nothing else. You'll get full marks once you're happy.

408
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,580
Hu Lu, let me tell you something.

409
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,020
From now on, you don't have to excel at everything

410
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,260
or win first place.

411
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,860
You don't... have to be that sensible

412
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,320
or try to please others.

413
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,059
As long as you're happy, you don't have to excel at everything

414
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,580
Really? I want to go shrimping at the riverside.

415
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,140
No way.

416
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,059
If I play at the riverside, you'll still beat me.

417
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,740
Bingo.

418
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,120
Hello, sir.

419
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,660
Yes, I'm at Erhai North Road.

420
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,520
I see.

421
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,360
Take your bag. Let's go.

422
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,860
Get your water bottle.

423
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,540
You're here. Give me a moment.

424
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,180
They want to take some photos.

425
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,820
Take photos?

426
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,460
A'Yao says they're for publicity.

427
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,260
Is this Cang Mountain and Erhai Lake?

428
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,100
Yes, it's a painting of these places.

429
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,500
How long will it take to finish the embroidery?

430
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,340
About several months.

431
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,100
Look at me.

432
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What are you doing?

433
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,420
Chairman Xie, I'm done.

434
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,760
- I see.
- Okay.

435
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,300
Ms. Xie, what do you want to give me?

436
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,540
Just a piece of clothing.

437
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,700
A traditional piece of clothing.

438
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,980
These aren't common anymore.

439
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,540
Look.

440
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,480
It's gorgeous.

441
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,680
This was my mom's dowry.

442
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,180
My granny embroidered it.

443
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,920
It's so precious. Are you sure you want to give it to me?

444
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,180
I meant to give it to A'Yao's wife.

445
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,760
When if we get married and then divorce? Will this still be mine?

446
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,140
It's yours, forever.

447
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,180
Very pretty.

448
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,539
I can't bear to wear it.

449
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,900
I want to leave it for my daughter or my daughter-in-law.

450
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Aunty, are you going to give her all these?

451
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,039
I can't keep them well. Insects may eat through them.

452
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,220
Xu Hongdou, you have to marry me if you accept this.

453
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,539
I don't care. This present is mine.

454
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:24,040
Ms. Xie said so, right?

455
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,880
Yes, I did.

456
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,740
You're really benefitting from our relationship.

457
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,380
Such embroidered ornaments can't even be bought now.

458
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,059
<i>[Singing Nana-chan]
Hello, everyone.</i>

459
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,280
<i>I'm Singing Nana-chan.</i>

460
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,640
<i>I'm back to sing for you.</i>

461
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,960
<i>I haven't live streamed for over a year.</i>

462
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,120
<i>I planned to stop my career as a streamer.</i>

463
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,339
<i>Right now, I'm working in a cafe in Yunnan.</i>

464
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,179
<i>I have many good friends I made here.</i>

465
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,040
<i>We all live in the same courtyard.</i>

466
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,899
<i>In addition to singing, I hope to share some stories</i>

467
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,259
<i>about my friends and I</i>

468
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,020
<i>that I find very meaningful.</i>

469
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,499
<i>Let's kick things off.</i>

470
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,059
<i>As per usual, I'll sing first.</i>

471
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,120
<i>Please enjoy "I'll Watch Over You".</i>

472
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,780
What are you doing?

473
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,500
Sister, we're having a courtyard bonding session.

474
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,760
Bonding session?

475
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,680
Sister Manjun, want to join us?

476
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,880
Isn't that Na Na?

477
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,360
Why did you send a yacht?

478
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,500
Why not just give her the money upfront?

479
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
Xia Xia, don't send such expensive gifts.

480
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,880
We just need to get the ball rolling and liven up the atmosphere.

481
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,020
Don't send such expensive stuff.

482
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,139
Who is watching such live streams? Why are they so rich?

483
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,560
She's restarting live streaming today, so the gifts are flooding in.

484
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,960
Shall I start live streaming, too?

485
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,399
You? Are you going to stream yourself scolding people?

486
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,639
Hu Youyu! Why are you laughing? Did I scold you?

487
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:28,140
Look. Everyone is laughing, but she only cares to snap at me.

488
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,379
You're the only pushover. Of course, it's you.

489
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,060
Sister Manjun.

490
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,259
Wait, Sister. How can you say that?

491
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:37,279
Teach me later. I know nothing about this.

492
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,080
Okay.

493
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,160

521
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,040
President Xu!

522
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,800
Ye Sen!

523
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,380
Chairman Xie said you're unloading ceramic tiles today.

524
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,740
He's busy, so he asked me to come and help you.

525
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,579
Why is he busy?

526
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,659
His former colleague introduced him to an investor.

527
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,080
They've gone to the village committee together.

528
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,759
What investor? He never mentioned this before.

529
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,020
An expert in tourist development.

530
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,240
He said he was here to tour Dali and drove here himself.

531
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,039
I reckon he's similar to President Liu of the bookstore, scared of grand receptions.

532
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,140
Park your bike there and have some tea.

533
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,340
We're almost done.

534
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,300
Hold on a second.

535
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,160
That was quite an old wall.

536
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,899
We'll preserve it instead of demolishing it.

537
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,240
It's a historical spot.

538
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,920
We make renovations for the preservation of many old houses.

539
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,360
Where will the bookstore be?

540
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,900
An old house in the farthest part of the village.

541
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,020
- This way, please.
- Sure.

542
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,380
Have a seat.

543
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,899
Everyone is here!

544
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:09,399
- A'Gui, you're back!
- A'Gui!

545
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,680
Hello!

546
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,799
You're back!

547
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,779
- Yes, I'm back.
- When did you come back?

548
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:16,420
Just now.

549
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,099
Qingdao has a lot of seafood.

550
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,680
Everything was delicious!

551
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,060
A'Feng, I brought you dried squid and fish.

552
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,620
I won't bother you guys.

553
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,280
I'll leave once I hand out the gifts.

554
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,419
How was your trip? Did you have fun?

555
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,200
It was so amazing!

556
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
That darned Zeqing

557
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,599
said he doesn't like living in a building.

558
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,739
Our children's home was already large,

559
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,539
but he keeps saying it's like a matchbox.

560
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,340
Too small.

561
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,719
He doesn't have many friends either,

562
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:02,159
so it has been quite tough for him.

563
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,999
He definitely wouldn't like life there.

564
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:07,960
That's just a wild boar who can't enjoy fine grains.

565
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,199
Can you get used to life there?

566
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,840
Of course!

567
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,240
I was so happy there!

568
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,379
I'm familiar with all the markets

569
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,080
and supermarkets in the neighborhood.

570
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,580
Every old lady in the neighborhood knows me.

571
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:30,339
I even know how many kids each family has, their kid's salaries and jobs,

572
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,899
and who are the filial kids.

573
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,440
I know everything like the back of my hand!

574
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,819
It's a waste that Aunty A'Gui isn't working in espionage!

575
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,180
She's just inquisitive.

576
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,459
Is A'Qiang at home? I'll visit you tonight.

577
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:45,000
Yes, he is. He's really hardworking.

578
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,360
He tidies up the whole house and yard, and works in the fields.

579
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,060
He's even learning to cook.

580
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,679
See! What did I tell you?

581
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,440
You seemed so spritely when I came in here.

582
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,559
Joy puts heart into a person! Right?

583
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,839
All right, Aunty A'Gui!

584
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,779
Excuse me, but we're working now.

585
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,880
Driving me away again?

586
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,079
I get it. I'm leaving.

587
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,460
I need to visit Baoping. I'll leave you to your work.

588
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,859
- Take care.
- Take care!

589
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,259
Qingdao's seafood is so tasty!

590
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,039
- Aunty, take care!
- Okay, I'm off.

591
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,200
Take care.

592
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,219
Here you go. Fried taro with seaweed.

593
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,340
Thank you.

594
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,600
Aunty Hua!

595
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,499
A'Yao, we were just talking about you.

596
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,279
Luckily, you didn't come at lunchtime.

597
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,699
Otherwise, there wouldn't be seats for you.

598
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,220
- Is your business that good?
- Yeah.

599
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,240
Congratulations.

600
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,280
Tons of people specially came here from the town,

601
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,560
but we're decided to go on a break.

602
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,119
Xiangdong's arm hurts so badly, he needs a numbing injection.

603
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,879
He's suffering from varicosity in his legs as well.

604
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,399
The doctor asked him to rest.

605
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,659
We've discussed this with Honghong and her husband.

606
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,199
They'll come back next month to help us operate the restaurant.

607
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,100
- Honghong is returning with her husband?
- That's great!

608
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,759
Enjoy your food.

609
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,000
Call me if you need anything.

610
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,499
- Okay.
- Thank you.

611
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,060
All done?

612
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,400
Thankfully, Ye Sen was around.

613
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,480
He checked every box.

614
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,459
Three boxes of tiles were incorrect. We sent them back immediately.

615
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:17,300
I'm experienced after helping out with the courtyard's renovations.

616
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,940
What about the investor?

617
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,519
No progress. He's here to look around first.

618
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,220
The village needs to get the opinions of higher-ups,

619
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,900
since this involves development policies.

620
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,320
It'll be fine.

621
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,620
I'm pretty astute with selecting investments, aren't I?

622
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,760
That's true.

623
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,640
President Xu, I admire your sagacity the most.

624
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,820
You're the master of high-risk investment.

625
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,340
Is running a homestay high-risk?

626
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,479
Didn't you invest the rest of your life in Chairman Xie?

627
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:52,019
If the homestay runs well,

628
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,360
I'll set up a branch elsewhere.

629
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
I can earn money myself.

630
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,820
If he treats me poorly, I'll abandon him.

631
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,360
Ye Sen is just a pot stirrer.

632
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,560
Madam,

633
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,660
would you join me for a song?

634
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,860

Here you are, fat dog.

656
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,579
Damai's dog came out. Where's she?

657
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,180
Damai is really like... that.

658
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,580
What?

659
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,380
You know, that.

660
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,660
Yeah.

661
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,860
Sister, a latte.

662
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,340
What happened to your head?

663
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,399
I was filming for "Master, Hit Me Again."

664
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:49,900
It's a bruise from my master.

665
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,980
Nana-chan, can I take a photo with you?

666
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,780
Sure.

667
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,099
Your boyfriend is a great photographer.

668
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,340
He outdid himself today.

669
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,680
Nana-chan, I really love you.

670
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,500
I like listening to you sing.

671
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,439
- Thank you.
- I watched your live streams all the time.

672
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,600
Thank you so much.

673
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,699
Na Na is a superstar now.

674
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,820
Loads of people want to take photos with her every day.

675
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,600
Hello.

676
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,660
Yes, we have an employee called Nana-chan.

677
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,299
Come here if you want to insult her. The address is Yunnan province.

678
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,980
Coward!

679
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,400
Are they still making calls?

680
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,939
The calls have decreased.

681
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,620
As long as they call, I invite them over.

682
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,240
Here for coffee?

683
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,679
What's wrong with your forehead?

684
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,659
- I was filming for—
- He's the exclusive punching bag for "Master, Hit Me Again.“

685
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,400
Got it?

686
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,240
Brother-in-law!

687
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,700
Brother Luo Quan.

688
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,000
Sister, don't yell at him.

689
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,080
I told you!

690
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,199
Try your best to persuade your dad.

691
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,999
If you can't, it doesn't matter.

692
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,280
I won't compromise on this matter with Xiao Hu Lu.

693
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,120
I...

694
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,020
You're the most dithering man I've met.

695
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,960
You've already over 30 years old.

696
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,199
Why are you still letting your dad decide your life?

697
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,319
Your dad is just over 50 years old.

698
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,680
He already treats those health product sellers as his relatives.

699
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,899
You have to support this family.

700
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,779
- You need your own opinions.
- I know.

701
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,219
What do you know?

702
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,200
Let me say something.

703
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,680
Fine. Go ahead.

704
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,080
My dad agreed.

705
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,580
He says we can go along with your plans.

706
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,640
Why did he agree so abruptly?

707
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,580
I told him you probably won't remarry me.

708
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,679
- He had no other choice.
- Probably won't? Of course, I won't.

709
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,760
Why am I the issue here?

710
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,000
You didn't remarry for years,

711
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,839
so I thought there might be a chance.

712
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:37,699
Hold on. Let me make things clear.

713
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,100
You want to remarry me?

714
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,840
When?

715
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,799
Why don't I know about this?

716
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,320
I've always had this thought.

717
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,580
Always.

718
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,679
It's been three years since we divorced.

719
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,999
I haven't remarried because I haven't met the right person.

720
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,440
This is none of your business.

721
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,140
When I was with you, my life was...

722
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,580
Of course. I was young then.

723
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,900
But I won't jump into the same pit again.

724
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,840
Got it?

725
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,460
Yes.

726
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,260
That's good.

727
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,160
It's getting dark.

728
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,559
You can't go back now.

729
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,119
Come to my home first. Let's talk tonight.

730
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,140
I need to get back to work.

731
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,950
What are you looking at?

732
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,580
