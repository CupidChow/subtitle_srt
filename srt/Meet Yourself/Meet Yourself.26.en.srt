<i>[Meet Yourself]</i>

00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:23,600
<i>[Episode 26]</i>

3
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,260
Look at this. It's Aunty E's dried fish.

4
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,640
- They're really well dried.
- Yes.

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,660
Better than mine.

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,900
What's she doing?

7
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,511
No clue. Is she exercising?

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,092
Doesn't she feel dizzy?

9
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,450
I don't know.

10
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,760
Look.

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,260
Check out her waist.

12
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,410
Look at it.

13
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,018
What's wrong with her waist?

14
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:59,162
Before I gave birth to Dayang, my waist was also 1.8 feet.

15
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,580
Not now, though.

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,626
Yours isn't worth mentioning either.

17
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,560
- Good morning.
- Hello.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,300
Did you come yesterday?

19
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,490
Yes.

20
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,050
This is Aunty Baoping.

21
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,658
I'm Aunty A'Gui.

22
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:16,489
One-third of the homestead in this courtyard belongs to my family.

23
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,490
So, I'm the landlady.

24
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm responsible for the cleanliness of this courtyard.

25
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,700
What's your name?

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,910
I'm Bai Manjun.

27
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,290
Just call me Xiao Bai.

28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,530
Xiao Bai.

29
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,566
What are you doing?

30
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm doing yoga.

31
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,956
What's yoga?

32
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:36,090
Perhaps it's the same as Mr. Ma's practices.

33
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,050
Mr. Ma sat there motionlessly,

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,420
but she's moving and doing handstands.

35
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,330
Right?

36
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,130
What?

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,320
Keep going.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's go upstairs.

39
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,150
Why doesn't she feel dizzy?

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,022
Youngsters don't get dizzy.

41
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,750
Dried bamboo shoots

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,550
and porcini.

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,534
I dried all for these for you.

44
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,610
Don't be afraid.

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,860
These aren't toxic!

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,096
I'm not afraid.

47
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,200
Aunty A'Gui, I'm not!

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,310
Well...This is too much.

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,610
It's really too much.

50
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,890
You need to bring back more for your parents to eat.

51
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,580
These cow's milk cheese and sausages are from me.

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,610
Thank you.

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,110
This is from A'Feng.

54
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,580
Dried peaches and apples.

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,530
These are from their orchard.

56
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,810
Very organic.

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,560
The dried peaches are great.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,832
They taste sweet even when soaked in water.

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,860
- Thank you.
- These, too.

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,104
Granny Xiuying's chili and sesame.

61
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:46,480
Granny Caiyun's black soybeans and soybeans.

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,560
Where's Aunty E's fish?

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,300
Where is it?

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
Over here.

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,350
Dried fish.

66
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,310
How are you going to bring everything back?

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,870
You've brought too much over! Goodness!

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,670
Besides... I haven't given you any gifts or done anything for you.

69
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,980
These are just tokens of our appreciation.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,580
You've been busy volunteering

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,808
and helping A'Yao tons.

72
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,580
All of us like you.

73
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,352
The grannies and aunties in the village don't want you to leave.

74
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:21,430
Hongdou, after you leave, don't forget us.

75
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,634
Remember to visit us.

76
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,460
Hongdou will be too busy to visit us.

77
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,536
Just make a call.

78
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,230
A video call!

79
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,930
Yes.

80
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,330
I've prepared some gifts.

81
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,500
Some are unopened.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,040
All of these are for you.

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,720
- Xiao Hu Lu.
- I'm here!

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,830
- Tuotuo.
- I'm here!

85
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,810
- Huzi.
- I'm here!

86
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,260
- Guobao.
- I want one, too!

87
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,530
You have to say, "Here"!

88
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,410
Here!

89
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,510
Here you go.

90
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,620
This is for you.

91
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,756
Thank you, Sister.

92
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,290
Here you go.

93
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,454
- Thank you, Sister.
- Thank you, Sister.

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,244
Thank you, Sister.

95
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,262
Hongdou, what's this?

96
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,600
That's a Luban lock.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,528
A Luban lock?

98
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,940
Make a promise to me.

99
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,770
After I leave, accompany Granny Xie at A'Yao's home more often.

100
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,480
- Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,870
Does Granny know how to play games?

102
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,700
You can teach her.

103
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,400
Okay.

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,830
Sister Hongdou, will you bring Lingdang here to visit me?

105
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,140
I don't know.

106
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,992
After you leave, who will marry Uncle A'Yao?

107
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,620
I don't know either.

108
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,330
When will there be a feast with stewed pork?

109
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,680
I want to eat sugar rice!

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,270
Me too!

111
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,278
Forget it, they won't get married.

112
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,870
We won't get to eat stewed pork.

113
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,186
No sugar rice for us.

114
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:04,240
One, two, three! One, two, three!

115
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,460
It's out! Come on!

116
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,720
All done. Thank you, buddy. Thank you.

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,370
Brother Jiu! I have something else on. I'll get going.

118
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,720
Okay. Thanks, A'Yao.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,610
- Not at all.
- I'm off. Bye-bye.

120
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,730
Thank you!

121
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,198
Thank you, brother.

122
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:34,970
Thanks.

123
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,820
Thank you.

124
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,760
All done. Thank you.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,430
Didn't the tractor fall into the ditch?

126
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,080
Yeah. I was covered in mud. So, I went home to take a bath.

127
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,060
Luckily, I made it here in time.

128
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,600
I already told you that I can go back on my own.

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,352
I said I'd pick you up.

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,900
Your wound is infected.

131
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,630
Did bath water get onto it?

132
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,571
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

133
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,730
You have to be careful.

134
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,590
Otherwise, it'll leave a scar.

135
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,680
Got it.

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,764
Should we take the seaside route?

137
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,090
A detour?

138
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,822
We can watch the sunset.

139
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,630
Xie Zhiyao.

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,080
Why are you taking photos of me?

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,860
As a keepsake.

142
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,298
You're behaving like a tourist now.

143
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,492
I am a tourist.

144
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,160
Fine. A tourist.

145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,000
Aunty Baoping and the rest are thinking about giving you food.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,178
After much thought, I still don't know what to give you.

147
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,330
Are you joking?

148
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,558
You've already given me tons of things.

149
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,772
What did I give you?

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,860
The sunrise. The sunset.

151
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,570
The starry sky.

152
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,320
The wind.

153
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,790
Courage. Hope.

154
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,350
Can't you be more materialistic?

155
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,940
I think I'm richer than you.

156
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,430
I have no loans.

157
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
It's beautiful.

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,529
You've really learned to enjoy the moment.

159
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,578
Of course.

160
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,570
These are the real luxuries.

161
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,830
Why are you silent?

162
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,214
I'm wondering how to express myself.

163
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,210
Express what?

164
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,400
Just speak your mind.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
It's a parting gift.

166
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,300
I made it myself.

167
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not an expensive trinket.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
I reckon you'd refuse a pricey gift.

169
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,300
You made it?

170
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,800
What's wrong?

171
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,600
Why are the two rings interlocked?

172
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,700
Magic.

173
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Balala dark magic.

174
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,900
You don't like it?

175
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,100
I love it.

176
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,300
Thank you.

177
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Did you injure your hand?

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Nah. It's red from pushing the tractor.

179
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,300
Looks good, right? It does.

180
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
You're pretty. So, everything you put on looks good.

181
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Xu Hongdou.

182
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,600
When I first met you,

183
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I thought you were uptight and plain.

184
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,200
After interacting with you, I realized you're an unlucky but interesting person.

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Every time I asked you for a favor,

186
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,900
you'd seem unwilling but give in anyway.

187
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
How should I put this?

188
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
I think you're...

189
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,300
I think you're someone...

190
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
who's just right.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Just right?

192
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,600
Just right to captivate my heart.

193
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,700
Every day that I'm with you,

194
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm overjoyed.

195
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,800
I feel delighted whether we're occupied or not.

196
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,200
So pleased that...

197
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,900
I'm feeling down.

198
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,400
That's because we met at a time and place that isn't that great.

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,470
Sometimes, I even start to regret it.

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
When I was in Beijing,

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
I often passed the hotel where you worked at,

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,100
but I never walked in.

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,832
If I went in, I could've gotten to know you earlier.

204
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,160
Maybe there would've been another possibility between us.

205
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I intended to let these words sink in my heart,

206
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,800
but I gave this much thought.

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
At the very end,

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
I want to gift you another memory.

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
By the seaside, where the wind blows...

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,900
and the sunset glow is our witness,

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,800
a man devoted his heart to you.

♫ <i>I'll give you the saddle of my heart</i> ♫

213
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,300
Xie Zhiyao, you sure are bold.

215
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
Unexpected, right?

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm forthright.

217
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't know what to say.

218
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
That's what I want.

219

All right, come on.

220
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you crying?

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You don't have to be so nice.

The room is a little small.

322
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,400
We burned a portion of her belongings.

323
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
We're keeping the rest in memory of her.

324
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
How about this? Your uncle and I can sleep here.

325
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,200
- You can sleep in our room.
- That won't do.

326
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll stay in this room.

327
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,100
Her scent is here.

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
It's okay.

330

Have a look.

332
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
You already sent us so much food.

333
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,300
Why have you brought more?

334
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

335
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,200
I brewed this wine.

336
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
How is it?

337
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,700
It's tasty.

338
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Right?

339
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,600
Someone planted two grapevines near the east wall.

340
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
They're stout,

341
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,600
but the grapes are too sour.

342
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,700
No one picks them.

343
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,400
Most of them are eaten by birds, and ants are drawn to them.

344
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,100
She thought it was a pity,

345
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
so she picked some to make wine.

346
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,410
What a surprise.

347
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,140
- It's pretty tasty.
- Yeah.

348
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,700
I shared the wine with many neighbors.

349
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,700
After that, the grapevines became very popular.

350
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
Don't just listen to us chat. Eat up.

351
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
I was about to say this.

352
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,500
Uncle, this chicken is delicious.

353
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Hold on. You guys can continue eating.

354
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,800
Let me take a video for my parents.

355
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Stop eating. You'll look bad in the video.

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,800
I'm at Nan Nan's home right now.

358
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,100
Uncle cooked many dishes for me.

359
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,300
The chicken is delicious.

360
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,400
This is Uncle Chen, the great chef.

361
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,900
Can't go wrong with free-range chicken.

362
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,500
Here's the pretty aunty.

363
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Finger heart! Finger heart.

364
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,900
This wine is made by her.

365
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,000
It's really tasty.

366
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,100
This is made from sour grapes, right?

367
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,000
Yes, but the wine isn't sour.

368
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
- All done?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Try the fish.

370
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,400
<i>[Family Chat (4)]</i>
Hold on. Let Hongdou eat first.

371
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,220
<i>[Xie Zhiyao]</i>

372
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
- Done.
- Quickly, eat up.

373
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,900
Have a taste of the fish.

374
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,900
Thank you.

375
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>Master hit me again.</i>

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
<i>Let's go.</i>

377
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,600
<i>Master, are you eating?</i>

378
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
<i>Isn't that obvious?</i>

379
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
<i>Why are there only two dishes?</i>

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
<i>Stop filming. Stop it.</i>

381
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
<i>What's there to film?</i>

382
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,100
<i>I'm just having lunch!</i>

383
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,400
<i>Stop it.</i>

384
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
<i>Master, look at this.</i>

385
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,600
<i>Darned brat.</i>

386
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>If you carve a dung beetle,</i>

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,200
<i>who's going to buy it?</i>

388
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
<i>This isn't carved. It's real.</i>

389
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
<i>Trying to scare me?</i>

390
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,100
<i>I'm not. These are real.</i>

391
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
<i>- Imp!</i>
- <i>Wait, Master.</i>

392
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>I just wanted to add a dish for you.</i>

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
<i>They're nutritious!</i>
- <i>Stop, please!</i>

394
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
<i>Master, don't hit me!</i>

395
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,100
<i>Stop it! Please!</i>

396
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,040
A'Yao.

397
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,700
Here you go.

398
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,952
The chicken soup is ready.

399
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,650
Try it.

400
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,070
This soup will taste fabulous with rice noodles tomorrow morning.

401
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,550
Finish it.

402
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll keep the rest for rice noodles in the morning.

403
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,820
Come on. I can drink it myself.

404
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
Okay.

405
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,714
Has Hongdou reached home?

406
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Probably.

407
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,200
She informed me when she landed.

408
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Has she had a meal?

409
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,400
Of course, she has.

410
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,000
- Ask her.
- Ask what?

411
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Ask her what she ate.

412
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why should I ask that?

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
You have to keep in touch with her.

414
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,700
I'll contact her when necessary.

415
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,300
Why should I contact her out of the blue?

416
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,400
If you aren't going to keep in touch, change this.

417
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Fine, I'll change it later.

418
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,600
You're not a shred like me.

419
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
When I wooed your grandpa as a young lady,

420
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
I followed him everywhere he went.

421
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,800
Granny, you're a hopeless romantic.

422
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,500
What did you say?

423
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,000
It refers to someone great at courting lovers.

424
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm not like that.

425
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,600
I merely fell in love with your grandpa.

426
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,400
I'm not like you.

427
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm pleased to send Xu Hongdou off.

428
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,400
This gorgeous babe has greatly hindered my career.

429
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
You're just in stubborn denial.

430
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
FInish it!

431
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,900
I will.

432
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,500
One, two, three, four...

433
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh no, it dropped.

434
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,300
You have to get the knack for this.

435
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,000
Do it like me. Sway and move. Yes.

436
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,300
Well done. And, go.

437
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,600
Xiaomei, is she the daughter of your cousin or your sister?

438
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
She's my goddaughter.

439
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
She came to visit from Beijing.

440
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
Goddaughter? She traveled all the way form Beijing?

441
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,700
That's great.

442
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,500
She often mails food and drinks to me.

443
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,400
That's really nice.

444
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,200
Aunty,

445
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Chen Nanxing told me that you took an entire night to give birth to her.

446
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
When she was born the next morning,

447
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,000
Uncle had just seen the South Star in the sky.

448
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,900
So, she was named Chen Nanxing.

449
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,400
I was duped by her for ages.

450
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,500
A while back, I learned that

451
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,770
the South Star can't be seen in the northern hemisphere.

452
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,400
She was named by her grandfather.

453
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
He grew arum lilies, Tian Nan Xing, in his yard.

454
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,400
These didn't need much water to flourish.

455
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
They were luxuriantly green, so he named her Nanxing.

456
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,100
Yes. She hated her name when she was young.

457
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,700
She detested sharing a name with the grass in her grandpa's yard.

458
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,600
Let's get some apples.

459
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,700
This one isn't good. Let Mom explain.

460
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,400
Apples...

461
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,000
Let Aunty explain.

462
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Apples with vertical stripes are sweet.

463
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,800
What's this? Let me take a look.

464
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
Hair dye cream.

465
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,500
This won't do. It's not good.

466
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,200
Why not?

467
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
No, not this one. Stop. This is too expensive.

468
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
- What are you doing?
- We aren't young.

469
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,400
We don't need this.

470
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
¥459.

471
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
You don't have to pay.

472
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
Don't pay.

473
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
Hey! Was it scanned?

474
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,300
Yes.

475
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Hongdou, she has more gray hair at the top.

476
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,600
Apply more there.

477
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
Don't be a smart alec.

478
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,800
She's more meticulous with this than you are.

479
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,200
I'm enjoying this.

480
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,700
Not necessarily.

481
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,200
Uncle is more experienced.

482
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
This is my first time.

483
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
He has poor eyesight.

484
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He often dyes my hair unevenly because he can't see well.

485
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
My eyes aren't bad.

486
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
They're so sharp.

487
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
All done. We just have to wait.

488
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,000
- You should rest.
- Come on.

489
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,700
Hongdou, have some tea.

490
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,200
Okay.

491
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,900
Did you stain your hands?

492
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,200
Nope.

493
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
Thank you.

494
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Let's take a photo.

495
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,100
A photo?

496
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,200
Look at you right now.

497
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
Come on.

498
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Here. Chili!

499
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,100
Cheese!

500
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,590
Your mouth is just like a catfish.

501
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,800
This won't do. That's too ugly.

502
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
This one is good.

503
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,300
- It's creative.
- Delete it.

504
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,600
Okay, I'll delete it.

505
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,300
Let's take another one.

506
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,200
Fragrant.

507
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,700
The rice noodles are ready. Who wants some?

508
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Mr. Hu, invite Sister over for it.

509
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,000
<i>All of them were chatting.</i>

510
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Not a single person was listening to my song.

511
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,900
Some folks even requested trending songs,

512
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,200
but they only listened to a portion of it.

513
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Goodness.

514
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,000
Mr. Hu, the rice noodles are ready.

515
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,300
Na Na, I have to head to town.

516
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,700
I'm the first today, so I'll pass.

517
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,900
What about you?

518
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,100
I skip dinners.

519
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,800
I'm going to the bar to listen to him sing.

520
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,900
We're off.

521
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,000
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

522
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
Bye-bye.

523
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Here's something even more preposterous.

524
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
When I'm singing on stage...

525
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I made too much.

526
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,800
<i>I spent the whole day writing documents,</i>

527
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
<i>and I have a meeting in town tomorrow.</i>

528
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,100
<i>What about you? What are you busy with?</i>

529
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,800
Today, a guest fell while riding at the horse ranch.

530
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,400
I took him to the hospital for an X-ray.

531
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,600
Was it severe?

532
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
Thank goodness he was wearing protective gear.

533
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,900
It was just a contusion.

534
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,800
Na Na, what did you cook?

535
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,000
Is it enough for two of us?

536
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,500
What's wrong?

537
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm fine. There's enough. I'll scoop some for you.

538
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,800
Are you crying because no one wants to eat your noodles?

539
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
No.

540
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,540
I just felt like it's been ages since I ate alone.

541
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,500
Suddenly, I noticed

542
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,300
the lights in all the rooms were off.

543
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,700
So...

544
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So, I felt a little lonely.

545
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm just being sappy.

546
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't think so.

547
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
You're just not used to the feeling of seperation.

548
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,000
Look. I seem like a strong girl.

549
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,700
When I visited my mom with my dad,

550
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,200
I started bawling as soon as I left.

551
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
Your mom must be really sad.

552
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,700
No way. She was overjoyed to send me off.

553
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,800
She has to cook for us when we're there. That's a disruption to her work.

554
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
That can't be true.

555
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,000
She's just acting aloof.

556
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's true.

557
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
My boyfriend secretly told me

558
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,300
that my mom heaved a sigh of relief after we left.

559
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,300
She even described my dad and me as clingy and unmovable statues.

560
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Your mom is my idol.

561
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Aren't I your idol?

562
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,600
I've worshipped Principal Tao for ages.

563
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
What about my fan club?

564
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,500
It was quietly dissolved.

565
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,900
Great.

566
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,200
Sorry.

567
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Your conversation is so bleak.

568
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Yes, it's bleak.

569
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Everyone's gone.

570
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,700
Don't worry.

571
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,400
New tenants will come.

572
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,000
The windows will be illuminated.

573
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
It's not the same.

574
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
No matter who comes,

575
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,600
Damai and Hongdou...

576
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,900
won't come.

577
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,600
Don't cry.

578
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,900
Old Xie, don't feel too upset either.

579
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
Look.

580
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm just putting up a photo.

581
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Go to bed early.

582
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,600
Aunty.

583
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
Well,

584
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

585
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,800
Go to bed with me.

586
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
Tell me more about Nan Nan.

587
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,100
A friend told me

588
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,200
when we talk about a person,

589
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
they exist.

590
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,500
When we stop talking about them,

591
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,700
they disappear.

592
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Let's chat more about her.

593
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,100
This was when Nan Nan was 100 days old.

594
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,600
She's one year old here.

595
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,800
Her grandma is carrying her.

596
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,200
She was so plump back then.

597
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,500
She has a large build.

598
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,600
It took me two days to give birth to her.

599
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,200
She weighed 3.9 kilograms when born.

600
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,500
Her whole body was red.

601
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
She was frowning and wailing.

602
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,200
I took a look at her and got a shock.

603
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,500
I wondered why I had such an ugly daughter.

604
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,400
This was when she entered elementary school.

605
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,600
Someone sold marinated chicken before her dad's company.

606
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
Those large drumsticks.

607
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,600
She ate one every day.

608
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Other kids were picky with food,

609
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,100
but she wasn't.

610
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,200
She ate anything served to her.

611
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
She's thinner here.

612
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,000
Yes.

613
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,300
Uncle was so handsome back then.

614
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,300
This is probably when she was in junior high.

615
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,700
I think it was her grandma's birthday.

616
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
There's a cake over here.

617
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,856
She slimmed down because she ate less and wanted to be pretty.

618
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
She was taller than me by this time.

619
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
She resembles her dad.

620
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,800
Right?

621
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,500
When Nan Nan just passed away,

622
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,200
your uncle and I felt hopelessly tortured.

623
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,500
We were silent at home.

624
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
We turned on the television, but no one was watching it.

625
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
When we missed her,

626
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,400
we came to this room and cried.

627
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,000
When we were exhausted from crying, we'd go to bed.

628
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,400
It was like a nightmare.

629
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Nothing felt real.

630
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,200
Our relatives and neighbors

631
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,900
came to see us out of kindness.

632
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,700
They cried with us.

633
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,600
We were only afraid of others prying.

634
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,300
Hongdou,

635
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,600
I always wonder if I was an evil person in my past life.

636
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,200
I've accomplished nothing in my life.

637
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm really grateful to you.

638
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,400
You often called us then.

639
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,300
You asked what we ate and did.

640
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,000
We couldn't offer any answers.

641
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,900
After that, you started making video calls.

642
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,200
I didn't notice because I was too overwhelmed.

643
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,400
Your uncle is more perceptive.

644
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
He asked me if I noticed that

645
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,400
Hongdou wasn't as sprightly,

646
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,200
and looked gloomy.

647
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,700
We're too selfish.

648
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,300
We only cared about ourselves.

649
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,900
We didn't notice that others must be sad, too.

650
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,500
Nan Nan's aunt is riddled with illnesses,

651
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
but she still cooks for us and sends us food often.

652
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,200
My nephews and nieces are busy with work,

653
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
but they often make time to visit us.

654
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,600
Your uncle persuaded me...

655
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
to let Nan Nan pass away with peace of mind.

656
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,600
We must be positive.

657
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,600
In fact, I've truly moved on.

658
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm fine.

659
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,000
It's all a matter of time.

660
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,600
We'll reunite on the other side.

661
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
We're doing well.

662
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,600
Don't worry.

663
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,400
We're fine.

664
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,400
These days, we exercise and eat well.

665
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,800
Don't worry about us.

666
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,300
You don't have to send food over all the time.

667
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,400
♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫
