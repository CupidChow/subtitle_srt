3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,220
What's up?

4
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,260
Have a taste.

5
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,880
A'Yao, why don't you introduce her to us?

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,180
She is... the lady boss.

7
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,299
So, you're admitting it.

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,680
- Lady boss!
- She's gorgeous!

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,620
Wonderful!

10
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,139
You won't believe anything else I say anyway.

11
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,859
- We will!
- We'll believe you!

12
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,039
- All right, hurry up.
- Do your work.

13
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,500
Okay, we'll work. Come on.

14
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,340
Why have you given up on denying it?

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,879
They're just joking.

16
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,880
If you're riled up, they'll be even more thrilled.

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
That's true.

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,900
So, fighting fire with fire is the best strategy sometimes.

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,699
Good point. Fighting fire with fire.

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
How is it?

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,719
The fragrance is pretty nice.

22
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,320
Is it sold in the cafe?

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,019
This is a newly established coffee brand.

24
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,379
I thought it tasted good, so I'm planning to launch it in the cafe.

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,359
Do you think this Pu'er coffee contains the taste of Pu'er tea?

26
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,659
Why would there be the taste of Pu'er tea?

27
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,960
Isn't Pu'er a place of origin?

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,580
You know that?

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,419
Many people are unaware that Pu'er is actually the name of a place.

30
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,879
They think Pu'er refers to Pu'er tea.

31
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,619
So, they'll assume Pu'er coffee contains the taste of Pu'er tea.

32
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,780
Why has coffee tasting turned into an examination?

33
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,660
Not bad. I underestimated you.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,680
Aunty, I want this one with the dinosaurs!

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,660
- Okay. This one?
- I want the one with stars!

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,239
- I also want the one with stars!
- Thank you, Aunty.

37
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,000
- I want the biggest one!
- Look how much fun they're having.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
Here you go. The one with stars, right?

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,659
Have another baby in a few years.

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,280
Bring a girl into the family.

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,040
Mom, sit next to me.

42
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,740
Okay. Once I finish distributing the cakes, I'll sit next to you.

43
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,160
- Okay?
- Okay.

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,460
Be good.

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,320
Enjoy your cake.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,060
Honghong,

47
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,920
it has only been a few days and he's inseparable from you.

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,159
Yeah.

49
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,260
We just got close

50
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,360
and I've got to leave again.

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,699
All right. Don't worry.

52
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,260
Come on. Let me have a piece of cake.

53
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,059
Oh, right. Here you go.

54
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,200
Have some cake, Mom.

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,219
Which of these is tastier?

56
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,720
Can these two be fried together?

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
Mom!

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,320
Mom!

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,380
He's calling you.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,960
Aunties.

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,239
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?

62
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,539
A'Chang's family is harvesting potatoes, so I came back a day early to help him.

63
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,439
Come home once you're done.

64
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,940
Got it.

65
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,979
Get home early!

66
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,700
Drive carefully!

67
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,099
He came back early.

68
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,160
I bet he misses you.

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,659
You got so muddy.

70
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,559
Why did you enter the fields with sneakers on?

71
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,640
I couldn't be bothered to change them.

72
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,639
Why don't you take a bath? I'll get your clothes.

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,860
There's no need.

74
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,760
I'll just wash my feet.

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
I have to head back later.

76
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
All right.

77
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,499
You've already moved to Kunming,

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,779
but you rushed back to your hometown just to help with potato harvesting.

79
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't you have to manage your business?

80
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,920
Your aunt is selling flowers through live streaming now.

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,400
She hired two people for packing.

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,819
I can leave for a day.

83
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,140
It's nothing.

84
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,620
Fine.

85
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,700
Leave it.

86
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,720
- It's enough.
- Will that do?

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
- Yeah.
- I'll leave this here. You can add more yourself.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Okay.

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,580
How's your business?

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,360
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Make sure you don't end up with unpaid loans.

92
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,379
Are you inquiring about this because you want to loan me money?

93
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,079
You dug up this hole yourself. I can't fill it in for you.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,100
I've heard all about it.

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,600
The homestay project in the village has been shut down.

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,480
The construction team stirred up trouble and implicated you.

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,500
Pipe smoker A'Quan is an utter fool.

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,140
His fists fly faster than his brain works.

99
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,620
They didn't cause any trouble.

100
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,219
Their wages were delayed. Surely they'll demand payment.

101
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:25,820
Look at all the problems you've dived into.

102
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,120
Think about this.

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,339
Your previous job in Beijing was cushy.

104
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,320
You were well-paid!

105
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,760
If you bought a house there and got married,

106
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,320
your child's education would be top tier.

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,339
Tsinghua or Peking University would all be at their fingertips.

108
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,760
You'd better count on A'Yuan for that.

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,040
How is he after he went back?

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,980
Here's a surprise.

111
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,300
This time, he turned over a new leaf once he returned.

112
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,700
He's finally willing to learn back home.

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,760
I also heard that...

114
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,780
you have a girlfriend.

115
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,120
Who told you this?

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,040
When harvesting potatoes, the villagers told me.

117
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,780
They said she's from Beijing.

118
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,840
Did you date someone in Beijing?

119
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,359
Don't listen to that village nonsense.

120
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,339
She's a tenant in the courtyard from Beijing.

121
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,320
She's not my partner.

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,020
She lives in the courtyard?

123
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,020
That's very close to us.

124
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,100
Invite her over so I can take a look.

125
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,999
You don't believe me, but you believe the words of others.

126
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:38,819
They said you're joined at the hip and always together.

127
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,879
She's my volunteer.

128
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,320
We're working partners.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,000
I knew it.

130
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,059
Why would a lady from Beijing be strange enough to come to this village

131
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,900
and live a life of poverty with you?

132
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,920
In Beijing, she can marry someone with a house.

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,919
The child's education—

134
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,259
The education would be top tier. Tsinghua or Peking University would all be at their fingertips.

135
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,519
Can Tsinghua and Peking University even fit so many people?

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
Come back.

137
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,080
The offerings from your aunt are in the trunk.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,919
It's in the parking lot.

139
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,760
Bring it back.

140
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,620
Weirdo.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Mom! Is the food ready?

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,920
Soon.

143
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,320
Why are there so many things again?

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,260
Coming.

145
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,740
Let's eat!

146
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,479
My cooking isn't great. I just used whatever ingredients we had.

147
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,860
Damai, I hope you don't mind.

148
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,820
Why would I?

149
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,679
Have a whiff of it!

150
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,699
It smells great.

151
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,599
Have more food.

152
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,360
Let's eat.

153
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,140
It's tasty.

154
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,760
Delicious.

155
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,000
- Right?
- Xiaochun's cooking is always delicious.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,479
Let me interview you.

157
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,360
Does my brother cook better than me?

158
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,940
You have your respective strengths.

159
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,699
I realized that your cooking reflects your personalities.

160
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,300
Take Chairman Xie as an example.

161
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
His cooking is very diverse.

162
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,200
It's a mystery how he comes up with those recipes,

163
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,780
but the food tastes amazing.

164
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,100
Xiaochun's cooking is simple and direct.

165
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,319
She fries meat... with all kinds of peppers.

166
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,620
Her vegetables are also fried with all kinds of peppers.

167
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,900
When she's in a good mood, she'll add sour papaya.

168
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,100
There's sour papaya in this.

169
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,340
As for Damai, she's very dedicated.

170
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,479
She only enjoys cooking rice noodles.

171
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:06,519
She'll make dried rice noodles, rice noodle soup, and stir-fried rice noodles.

172
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,180
As for Na Na,

173
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,880
she enjoys making desserts.

174
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,339
She likes baking cakes.

175
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,000
Things that are sweet and pleasing to the eye,

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,380
but cooking meals isn't her forte.

177
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,339
Such elaborate analysis.

178
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,640
Well, tell us your style.

179
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,540
Mine? Mine is obscure.

180
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,900
I can make salted eggs and pickled radish.

181
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,739
I can also brew soy sauce and make soybean paste.

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,720
I learned them from my grandma.

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,299
That's not obsucre. That's just peculiar.

184
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,779
These aren't dishes. They're ingredients.

185
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,400
What's your specialty?

186
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
I can make Crispy Pot.

187
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,940
Crispy Pot? What's Crispy Pot?

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,599
Every family has their own recipe.

189
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:54,160
Our family uses a clay casserole,

190
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
and we put pork knuckles at the bottom.

191
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,000
Then, we add cabbage, kelp, and fried food.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,099
We pile everything up and add water.

193
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,939
After that, we'll add spices and stew it.

194
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,220
Brother!

195
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,120
Did Uncle bring back so many flowers?

196
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,100
Take some back with you later.

197
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,440
Where's Uncle?

198
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,339
In the room.

199
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,000
He's chatting with Granny. You can go in.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,339
Xiaochun, you're here!

201
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,300
- Uncle!
- Come in!

202
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,239
I haven't met you in ages!

203
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,520
Isn't that so? Come on in.

204
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,320
Granny!

205
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,020
There are so many flowers.

206
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,080
Which ones are for me?

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,539
You can take your pick from everything except the chrysanthemums.

208
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,680
Take some back for Damai and Na Na, too.

209
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,800
Your dad really is a wholesaler at the flower market.

210
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,320
Smells really sweet.

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,840
Do you buy flowers for yourself?

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,239
I don't have time to buy flowers.

213
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm not Xu Hongmi.

214
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,599
She has a helper to care for her flowers. Right?

215
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,059
What are your plans for your grandpa's death anniversary?

216
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:17,599
We'll clean the grave and offer some flowers and fruits.

217
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,220
We'll offer some incense, too.

218
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,140
In a blink of an eye, four years have passed since Grandpa left us.

219
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,959
It really is a blink of an eye.

220
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,460
It's been three years since my grandma passed away.

221
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,480
How did your grandma pass away?

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,420
She was in good health.

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,980
It snowed in winter.

224
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,919
The next morning, there was ice on the floor at the entrance.

225
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,520
She didn't notice and slipped.

226
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
It was a pelvic fracture.

227
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,120
She was bedridden for a week.

228
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,320
After that, it caused thrombosis.

229
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,680
An accident?

230
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,920
What about your grandpa?

231
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,680
Cancer.

232
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,820
You were pretty close to your grandpa, weren't you?

233
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,760
In my memory, I remember very little about my parents.

234
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,240
My grandparents occupy most of my memories.

235
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,519
When I find time to be alone in the recent few years,

236
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,880
I often think about my childhood.

237
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,700
Back then, Grandpa was very robust.

238
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,440
He even taught me horse riding.

239
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,600
<i>Stop running!</i>

240
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,100
<i>I won't spank you anymore!</i>

241
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
<i>Stop running.</i>

242
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,979
<i>Come over here.</i>

243
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,580
<i>I won't hit you.</i>

244
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,459
<i>Guanjun, A'Qiang, run!</i>

245
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,339
<i>Xie Zhiyao!</i>

246
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,299
<i>Xie Qiang won't abandon his brother!</i>

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

248
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,080
<i>Grandpa!</i>

249
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,081
<i>- Grandpa, help me!</i>
<i>- Slow down. Don't run.</i>

250
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,979
<i>Grandpa, Granny is going to beat A'Yao to death!</i>

251
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,100
<i>What's going on?</i>

252
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,820
<i>Were you three up to some mischief again?</i>

253
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,980
<i>What happened?</i>

254
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,240
<i>Deqing came to tell me</i>

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,219
<i>your beloved A'Yao put firecrackers in their rice bucket!</i>

256
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,699
<i>That old peacock blabbered nonsense first! We were only getting even with him!</i>

257
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,459
<i>That old peacock said A'Yao's parents left town for work.</i>

258
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,959
<i>They'll have another baby and abandon him!</i>

259
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,979
<i>That's nonsense!</i>

260
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,040
<i>I'll get Grandpa Yang to teach him a lesson.</i>

261
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>That being said... You shouldn't put firecrackers in their rice bucket.</i>

262
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,819
<i>Don't stop me today. I have to spank him today!</i>

263
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:58,219
<i>I'll make sure he doesn't waste food ever again!</i>

264
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,280
<i>Darling.</i>

265
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,819
<i>Calm down. Calm down.</i>

266
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,459
<i>If you want to hit someone, hit me.</i>

267
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,080
<i>You always spoil him.</i>

268
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,299
<i>Two catties.</i>

269
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,420
<i>- All right. ¥2.20.
- Okay.</i>

270
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,979
<i>Come again if it tastes good.</i>

271
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,860
<i>Okay.</i>

272
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,199
<i>What a clever kid you have there.</i>

273
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,339
<i>Clever?</i>

274
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,120
<i>He's just a naughty imp.</i>

275
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,979
<i>I'm off.</i>

276
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,960
<i>- Take care.
- Okay.</i>

277
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,459
<i>There isn't much fish left.</i>

278
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,579
<i>Let's pack up for the day.</i>

279
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,459
<i>We can get your granny to stew fish soup for us.</i>

280
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,160
<i>Okay!</i>

281
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,180
<i>Do you want to eat steamed buns?</i>

282
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,460
<i>Here you go.</i>

283
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,560
<i>Grandpa, wait for me!</i>

284
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,200
<i>Slow down!</i>

285
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,019
<i>Grandpa, have one.</i>

286
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,319
<i>I'm not hungry. You can have it.</i>

287
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,000
<i>Grandpa, when I earn money in the future,</i>

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,819
<i>I'll buy you steamed buns, too.</i>

289
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,080
<i>That'll be great.</i>

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
<i>You have to study hard.</i>

291
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,760
<i>In the future, find a high-paying job.</i>

292
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,620
<i>At that time, I won't fish anymore.</i>

293
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,280
<i>I'll wait for you at home to buy steamed buns for me.</i>

294
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,779
<i>Okay. Granny, too, and Granny Huailan!</i>

295
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,700
<i>What about your parents?</i>

296
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
<i>What's wrong?</i>

297
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,480
<i>I won't give them any.</i>

298
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,520
<i>Why not?</i>

299
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,299
<i>They don't come back to visit me.</i>

300
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,640
<i>Did they really abandon me?</i>

301
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,600
<i>Silly grandson.</i>

302
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,740
<i>How could they abandon you?</i>

303
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,619
<i>They're working hard out there to earn money just for you.</i>

304
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,960
<i>It's hard to make money.</i>

305
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,980
<i>When will they come back?</i>

306
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,500
<i>They'll come back for the Benzhu Festival.</i>

307
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,600
<i>Do you miss them?</i>

308
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,420
<i>No, I don't.</i>

309
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,340
<i>You're lying.</i>

310
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,599
<i>I don't miss them!</i>

311
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,600
<i>I don't!</i>

312
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,020
<i>Sit tight.</i>

313
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,720
<i>Let's go home!</i>

314
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,439
♫ <i>The tower is tall</i> ♫

315
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,319
♫ <i>Slim and elegant</i> ♫

316
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,860
♫ <i>My baby, time to sleep</i> ♫

317
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,740
Childhood memories are always filled with joy. Right?

318
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,160
After that, I went to college.

319
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,419
Every time I called home, Grandpa and Granny would tell me everything was well at home.

320
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,560
I should just focus on my studies.

321
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,600
After graduation, I got a good job.

322
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,879
Grandpa was very proud of me.

323
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:40,860
He told everyone he met that I had succeeded in life.

324
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,200
Granny wasn't as showy as he was.

325
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,160
Cancer was a serious matter.

326
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,560
When it was confirmed,

327
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,000
he told my family to keep it from me.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
He was afraid of affecting my work.

329
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,059
After that, he went to Kunming

330
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,220
to have surgery and undergo chemotherapy.

331
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,160
It took more than half a year.

332
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,639
I was really busy back then,

333
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,100
and I didn't notice anything amiss.

334
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,600
When my dad told me the truth,

335
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,700
he was already bedridden in the hospital.

336
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,220
He couldn't even speak anymore.

337
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,980
That must've left you with regrets.

338
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,500
Yeah.

339
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,460
It was really hard for me to accept it back then.

340
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
If they had told me earlier,

341
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,320
I could've been by Grandpa's side for a little longer.

342
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,160
All these years,

343
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,240
my heart has been...

344
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,000
How should I put it?

345
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
It's...

346
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,900
It's eating at you?

347
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,180
Yes.

348
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,660
It's eating at me.

349
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,980
I can empathize with this.

350
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,920
When my grandma died,

351
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,560
it was hard for me to move on.

352
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,539
It was better when I had to work during the day.

353
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,620
My work would take away all my time to think.

354
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,840
The nights were hard to endure.

355
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,979
I'd lie in bed, tossing and turning, as my mind spiraled in thoughts.

356
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:40,820
I always regret not calling her more often and spending time with her.

357
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,459
I should've asked about her and visited her.

358
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,960
All these things...

359
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,860
How did you manage?

360
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,620
At that time, my best friend

361
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,760
traveled two districts every day to be with me.

362
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,920
Only when she held my hand could I fall asleep.

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You overcame it with just her company?

364
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,500
I couldn't really move on back then,

365
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,900
but it would pass someday.

366
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,200
What if I can't let go for the rest of my life?

367
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,600
It'll pass.

368
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
What doesn't come to pass in life?

369
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,500
Right?

370
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
The things eating at you will also come to pass.

371
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
You're right.

372
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
We understand this in theory,

373
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
but...

374
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,800
It's hard to endure when reality hits.

375
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
What kind of flowers are these? They smell amazing.

376
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,200
Lychee.

377
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Lychee?

378
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
There's no smell of lychee.

379
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Pu'er coffee doesn't contain the taste of Pu'er tea.

380
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,100
However, lychee roses do smell like lychee.

381
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,600

When I woke up early this morning,

455
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,400
I laid in the side room and stared at the window.

456
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
My mind was still hazy.

457
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,300
It was as though

458

we stayed in that room.

The family was poor when you were young.

462
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
The entire family lived on a few meager pieces of land

463
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,700
and...

464
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,900
your grandpa's earnings from fishing.

467
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,000
Your mom called the shots in the family.

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Your mom said that

469
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,600

and then she took me to Kunming.

474
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,000
At that time, traveling was inconvenient.

475
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
There was no transportation.

476
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
We arrived at Xiaguan,

477
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,200
we still had over three hours of mountain paths to trek to get home.

478
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,700
We only came back once a year.

479
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,900
Life was such a frenzy, and we couldn't stay for many days.

480
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,600
We had to leave before we could even deepen our ties with you.

Every time we left,

482
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,700
your mom would cry the entire way back.

483
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
When she fell ill,

484
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
she was bedridden and couldn't move.

485
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
She had no strength to talk either.

486
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
I asked her...

487
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,100
if she regretted leaving.

488
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,500

489

In addition to regular tea,

506
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,200
we've also considered the tastes of different customers

507
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,900
and developed a series of special products.

508
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,800
Of course, we are very strict with the raw ingredients

509
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
of all our products.

510
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,700
We ensure zero pollution

This is fusion tea.

This is the most important one.

514
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,700
This has a black tea base.

515
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,500
Dianhong Black Tea.

516
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,600
It has a strong taste.

It only contains whole milk.

As for those with dairy allergies,

520
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
we've also developed a soy milk series.

521
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,200
You can add Chia seeds and boba to them.

522
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,700
Our boba will be made with konjac flour.

523
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,400
We will not add any brown sugar or corn flour.

524
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,400
So, these still cater to those on a diet.

525
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Most importantly, it helps

526
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
to relieve bowel movements.

Making boba with konjac...

Well, it's... it's a long story.

Please give us a score based on the taste.

It's best if you can be honest about your thoughts.

It just needs to be within 50 words.

Cleanse your palate first.

548
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,500
- What's wrong.
- This is horrible. Why is it so bitter?

549
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
The bitterness is right. Bear with it.

550
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,300
After that, there'll be an aftertaste of sweetness.

551
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,400
Then, you'll find it sweet.

552
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
You should be tasting it right about now—

What about the rest?

587
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,400
At the most, a two out of ten.

This tastes great. It's delicious.

592
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,900
The milk doesn't drown out the taste of black tea,

593
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,400
and the tea is gentle on the palate.

594

A connoisseur.

595
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,400
The third leaf, the fourth leaf,

596
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,800
and the stem in between makes up my tea shreds.

597
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,200
It's economical and very sweet in taste.

598
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000

600
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,100
It has the taste of jasmine tea.

601
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,300
It has jasmine tea as its base.

602
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,200
Excellent! This is fabulous!

603
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600

Why does this taste so amazing?

605
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
There's still room for improvement.

606
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,100
It's tasty.

607

Hear this.

609
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,300
Many people are lactose intolerant,

610
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,100
so I developed a soy milk series.

611
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,800
I'm fine. I can drink milk.

612

We're really on the same page.

613

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,300
It's so quaint!

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,100
You're a genius!

617
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,500
How did you think of brewing Pu'er tea with soy milk?

618
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,700
- It's raw Pu'er tea.
- Raw Pu'er tea.

619
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,000
It's an amazing combition.

620
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,700
Tastes delicious.

621
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,000
There's also this, right?

622
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,300
This...

623
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Refreshing and sweet.

624
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,200
What's this?

625
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,300
This is...

626
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,700
It's water to cleanse your palate.

627
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,000
Water! Water is great.

628
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
30% tea and 70% water.

629
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,800
I can drink water after the tea,

630
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,400
and continue enjoying the tea after drinking some water.

631
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,000
Mr. Ma, let me try your pure tea.

632
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,100
Do you want to try pure tea, too?

633
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Sure.

634
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Pure tea.

635
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
Be careful, it's hot.

636
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
The pure tea is delicious as well.

637
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
Let me try this.

638
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,600
These two... are the same.

639
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,100
The same?

640
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,400
Do you have the scorecard?

641
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,700
- Let me give you a score.
- Yes, give a score.

642
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,100
I have the card here.

643
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,300
Here. Give me a score.

644

Fragrance.

645
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,300
Well, be objective.

646
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,100
I'm very objective.

647
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm extremely satisfied.

648
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Delicious.

649
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,800
You can leave

650
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,200
some brief thoughts or suggestions.

651
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
Is 800 words enough?

652
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Eight...

653
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,600
It's enough.

654
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,000
All right.

655
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
How is it?

656
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Tastes amazing.

657
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,700
In what sense?

658
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,100
I think it's great in all aspects.

659
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,500
As a literary creator, why is your vocabulary...

660
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,600
You... You need to be more precise.

661
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,500
I can write,

662
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,000
but I'm clumsy in speech.

663
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,100
How about this?

664
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,200
Can I send you a WeChat message?

665
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you have my WeChat contact?

666
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,000
Do you have a WeChat account?

667
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah.

668
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Can your mobile phone download WeChat?

669
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,500
This one can't.

670
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
It can't be downloaded here.

671
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,500
This one can.

672
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,000
Come on.

673
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,700
Add me.

674
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,400
Here you go.
