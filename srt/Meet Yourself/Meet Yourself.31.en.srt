3
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,700
- Put it down.
- Get out of the way.

4
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,100
Get that bastard out.

5
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,200
Get him out. Don't think I won't hit a lady!

6
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
- Exactly!
- I'm warning you guys.

7
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
We use this broom to clean the bathroom.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Stop wasting your time with her!

9
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,000
Go! Get her away!

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,800
You said you're his girlfriend,

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,700
but do you know he's cheating on you?

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,200
He said he didn't do that.

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,900
He doesn't know her! He's clueless!

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,000
He didn't do it?

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
If that's true, why did he run off so quickly?

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
Ridiculous!

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,300
- Bah!
- Grab her!

18
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll take the broom.

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Together!

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,800
Get out of the way!

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
- Look what you've done to them.
- Keep your distance!

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,500
They deserved it.

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
- Sister Manjun!
- Xie Zhiyao!

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
- You're finally here.
- What's wrong? Are you hurt?

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
They beat up Xiao Yu and claimed that

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
he was seeing their friend's fiancee.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,900
- No way.
- Reinforcements?

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,400
They called for help.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,500
Help?

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Stop! Hang on a moment.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's make things clear. Whose fiancee was it?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
My buddy, Jin Ming.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,900
Jin Ming?

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,500
That sounds familiar.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,400
He runs the dessert shop at the crossing.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, Jin!

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
Did he send you here?

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,700
Don't blame him unncessarily.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,800
We decided to teach this scumbag a lesson.

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,300
He said he doesn't know.

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
He isn't acquainted with her. Are you deaf?

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,800
Get him to come out.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,300
I'll make him confess to his deeds.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,800
I can tell he's a douchebag.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Give me a minute. I'll call Jin right now just to make sure.

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
He got his number?

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,300
A misunderstanding? You must be kidding.

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
From your accent, where exactly in the Northeast are you from?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Shenyang. Why?

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,400
Shenyang?

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,700
I used to live there.

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,200
Northeastern men are so righteous.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,100
That's right.

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Jin.

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,600
Your three friends accused Hu Youyu of stealing your girlfriend.

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
They beat him up.

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,600
Jin Ming's girlfriend cheated on him with a singer.

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
The one who was working there before Mr. Hu.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,700
He's escaped to Lijiang by now.

61
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,300
Thanks.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,300
Mr. Hu, why did you run off?

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,400
You could've explained yourself.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
They wouldn't listen anyway.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm fine. This isn't the first time.

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Once, a girl wanted me to date her.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,900
When I agreed, her boyfriend showed up.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,400
What should we do about this?

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Let it be.

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,900
They mistook me for someone else.

71
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
By the way,

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,500
I feel sorry for that dude.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,000
His friends are pretty loyal.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
As for me, these injuries aren't severe.

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Let's not pursue this.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
No way.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
What do you want?

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
An apology.

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
That's not necessary.

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
Even if they apologize to me, that won't change anything.

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
They have to apologize.

82
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,300
Well, you guys can go back.

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,600
It's late.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
I need to take a shower.

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
I smell.

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Off you go.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Is he all right?

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
I'll help you.

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
Don't stay up. Good night.

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,500
Xu Hongdou,

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,200
what do you think of me?

93
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,800
I've said this many times. You're pretty great.

94
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,000
I'd like to share my current situation with you.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,900
No, don't.

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,600
It's too late now. We can talk about it tomorrow.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm craving that small pot of rice noodles.

98
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
We can take a stroll back along the seaside after that.

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
Let's chat on our way back.

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Okay.

101
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
- Good night.

I have to say it now.

Must you say it at night?

112
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
I can't hold it in.

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Xu Hongdou, I have loans to pay right now,

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
but I have around ¥50,000 in savings.

You pass. I know about this.

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,600
Move on from the finances.

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I live with my granny.

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,800
My dad and my stepmom run a flower business in Kunming.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
I also have a rebellious younger brother.

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,300
My stepmom is very nice.

122
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,500
I know that, too.

123
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
You pass.

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
What about yourself?

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm still too young to be considered a successful man.

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
I don't have a house in the city.

127
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,600
I only have a family home, land in the countryside,

128
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
and a career with unstable prospects.

129
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,200
I know more or less about this.

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
These are all the existing conditions.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,900
Xu Hongdou, I've met many people over the years.

132
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,400
Many nice ladies, to be specific.

133
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,000
But I never felt drawn to any of them.

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
None of them have mattered.

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
But you've made my heart falter.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,300
Perhaps you offer the perfect amount of warmth.

137
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,300
You flow toward me and pick up the breeze.

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,900
Do you get it?

139
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
A little, but not really.

140
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Come on. Why don't you get it?

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,900
The wind rises, stirring the calm river.

142
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,500
Do you understand?

143
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
Hey, Xu Hongdou.

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Don't play dumb with me.

145
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,500
You're just enjoying yourself as you hear me rattle on. Right?

146
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,900
- Is that all?
- Yes.

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,000
Will you... be my girlfriend?

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,900
Nope.

149
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,100
No?

150
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,820
Nope!

151
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,719
Hey! You already rejected me last time!

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,789
Why are you rejecting me again?

153
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Must I try three times, like Liu Bei with Zhuge Liang?

154
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Didn't I tell you, we can talk tomorrow?

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Let me do my makeup and dress well tomorrow.

156
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
You can confess your feelings by the seaside, and I'll agree.

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
You might even get a kiss.

Xu Hongdou, open your door right now.

162

Continue agonizing until tomorrow!

Seriously, Xu Hongdou?

164
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
Are you having cold feet? Being a scaredy cat?

165

Say whatever you want. See you tomorrow.

Make it clear. What are we now?

169
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
Are you nuts?

170
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
Why are you climbing up to my window so late at night? What if you fall off?

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You could've opened the door.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,700
Fine. I'm opening it now.

173
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,400
You don't have to.

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Stay here. Do I get a kiss?

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Stop laughing!

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Will you kiss me or not?

177

181
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,900
You're standing too high up. Get down.

182
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,800
I'll open the door.

183
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,100
Okay.

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
What is it?

185
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Xie Zhiyao?

188
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,650
Hey!

189
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
How is your ankle?

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Did I say that?

191
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200

Xu Hongdou.

200
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,540
Wait a minute. I'm heading down.

201
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,350
Sure.

202
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,870
Come on, let's go. The rice noodles will sell out soon.

203
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,509
- Hurry up.
- Here you go.

204
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,180
All right. Slow down. There's no rush.

205
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,619
Did you sleep well last night?

206
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:56,890
It was bad!

207
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,220
You texted me at 3:00 in the morning!

208
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,529
What's wrong with you?

209
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,150
You didn't reply!

210
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,770
Mister, it was 3:00!

211
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,260
You're the only one awake.

212

- Let's go.
- Sure.

213
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,340
You have my respect.

214
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,410
What do you mean?

215
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,780
It's nothing.

216
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,760
Xie Zhiyao, you have a slim waist.

217
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,639
Stop touching me. Safety first.

218
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,240
I just love to do so.

219
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,289
Let's go.

220
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:27,620

Do you miss the concrete jungle?

Maybe in the future.

236
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,110
I might miss urban life and the such.

237
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,959
That's how humans are.

238
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,100
We keep changing our minds.

239
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,130
Once we gain something, it loses its charm.

240
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,480
Things lose their charm once you have them?

241
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,750
Beauties sure are fickle.

242
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,530
I'm talking about things.

243
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,300
Don't misinterpret my words.

244
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,800
Look! You're resorting to violence! I'm doomed.

245
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,629
I'm just kidding. Don't be so uptight.

246
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,700
What a scheming man.

247
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,220
Me? Scheming?

248
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,809
I'm as pure as spring water! How could I be scheming?

249
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,470
To be honest, I only realized this after returning.

250
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,650
Before I left,

251
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,400
why did you give me a wood carving necklace?

252
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,980
Why did you confess your love at the seaside?

253
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,670
Why did you dress so nicely

254
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,199
and treat me so well? Right?

255
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,930
You wanted my mind to linger here even after I left.

256
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,460
Isn't that scheming?

257
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,390
You? Lingering feelings?

258
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,079
Didn't you move houses once you went back?

259
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,180
You kept uploading your dad's handmade noodles and your mom's dumplings on Moments.

260
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,099
You even posted about your grandma's 20-year-old electric fan.

261
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,760
You were having the time of your life.

262
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,330
Completely unlike me, depressed from my broken heart.

263
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,100
I wasn't having fun.

264
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,440
I was confused, too.

265
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm not into long-distance relationships.

266
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,670
Yes, I know.

267
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,650
Even dating someone two districts away is a long-distance relationship to you.

268
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,220
Though, I must admit that my heart wavered.

269
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,670
Perhaps it's true that our minds are ever-changing.

270
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,860
We draw the line differently for different people,

271
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,310
but I'm no longer a little girl.

272
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,330
I won't be reckless in love.

273
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,879
I must consider the future.

274
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,550
There must be a plausible solution,

275
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,370
before thinking about my next step. Right?

276
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,730
Yeah. If you were insistent on returning to Beijing,

277
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,660
I was planning to take flights to meet you in Beijing.

278
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,820
Who would've thought that you'd consider running the homestay?

279
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,219
Listen up. I did my research before deciding to take over the homestay.

280
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,339
I even consulted some experts.

281
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,139
I contemplated for a long time.

282
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,469
The news confirming the bookstore's opening pushed me to make my final decision.

283
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,700
My cousin also played a part.

284
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,059
Her accident put an end to my hesitation.

285
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,450
Life is full of accidents.

286
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,069
I don't want to waste my time thinking too much and drowning in worries.

287
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,660
Life is meant to be unpredictable.

288
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,410
Don't you think?

289
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,180
Xie Zhiyao, you're one of the reasons,

290
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,890
but not the sole one.

291
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,069
I made this decision for myself as well.

292
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,970
So, I will bear the consequences.

293
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,500
You don't have to worry about that.

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,180
Don't sever me from your life.

295
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,250
I have to share the responsibility.

296
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,900
You've come here.

297
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,239
As your boyfriend and the village beau, I must take care of you.

298
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:42,640
We just have to care for each other here.

299
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,750
You're only responsible for this,

300
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,410
but I insist on taking full responsibility for you.

301
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
When will you two notice me?

302
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,490
Xiao Qin?

303
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,550
Candy!

304
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,020
- Sister Hongdou.
- Yeah?

305
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,310
How do I make a man care for me?

306
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,780
That's so weird.

307
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,060
Why doesn't Yang Zhinan ever say such things?

308
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,180
It's hard to say such things.

309
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,240
Is he embarrassed because he thinks he's inferior to me?

310
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,810
Xiao Qin, shouldn't you be working in the fields? You should get going.

311
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,300
So frustrating.

312
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm off.

313
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,330
Let's go. Time to work.

314
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,550
Your purse.

315
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,449
It's another great day today!

316
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,990
Yeah, a great day!

317
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,550
How old is this residence?

318
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,760
I'm afraid it's pretty old.

319
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,499
It's an ancestral home. It's been here for over a century.

320
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,299
The villagers have been earning more money lately.

321
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,540
So, they've rebuilt their houses.

322
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,799
The great-grandpa of this family made his fortune by running caravan horses.

323
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,940
He built this house. After that, his family couldn't keep his business going.

324
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,899
So, they couldn't afford to build a new home.

325
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,200
This house has been patched up time after time.

326
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,730
Right now, it's an old estate.

327
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,540
It's must've been hard to preserve it.

328
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,810
This place is great.

329
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,590
Do you like it here?

330
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,780
I've already been to many places.

331
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,040
Some are farmlands, where residential use is prohibited.

332
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,440
Others are still occupied.

333
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,070
This place is perfect.

334
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,200
It's spacious, and it has history.

335
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
We can renovate it.

336
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,800
The only shortcoming is that it's on the far side of the village.

337
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,329
It's inconvenient to come here. Cars can't drive over.

338
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,760
- Director Zhang! Here's a quiz for you.
- What quiz?

339
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,560
Just now, I saw the words "Legacy of the Azure Lotus" on a screen wall.

340
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,899
What's this family's name?

341
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,280
Li.

342
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,740
What about "Honesty and Virtue"?

343
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,689
Their surname would be Yang.

344
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,730
What about "Quiet Seas and Clear Rivers"?

345
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,300
Well... That isn't about family names.

346
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,410
It refers to the serene environment of a place.

347
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,370
Quiet seas and clear rivers, harmonious times, and peaceful living.

348
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,930
Fascinating. I'll search for more.

349
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,900
She's a fresh graduate. A lively girl.

350
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,340
That's nice.

Hi.

388
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,899
May I have your name?

This is my team.

393
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,050
Hello.

394
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,099
We saw the video about your village online.

395
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,060
We thought this place looked nice, but we didn't see many posts about it.

396
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,300
So, we're here to visit some iconic spots.

397
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,530
Welcome.

398

<i>He's so cute.</i>

<i>What are you carving?</i>

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,160
<i>- A lotus.
- A lotus?</i>

401
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,350
It's quite large. What is this for?

402
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,240
<i>A wall decoration.</i>

403
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,200
<i>Oh, a decoration!</i>

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,370

Thank you.

416
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,380
Miss, what...

417
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,170
Engineer Zhang and Director Zhao really like this residence.

418
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,140
It's spacious and an old estate.

419
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,170
They can renovate it while ensuring its preservation.

420
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,860
The only problem is the isolated location of the house.

421
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,140
Yeah, it's not very ideal.

422
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,010
Even the shuttle bus can't drive over.

423
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,699
The road is narrow, and vehicles can't get there. Everyone has to go on foot.

424
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,330
Let's look at this from a different perspective.

425
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,800
Look at this.

426
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,419
A homestay is to the house's left, and the tie-dye workshop is on the right.

427
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,879
The village is small, and most places are clustered together.

428
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:12,350
In fact, walking is the most convenient way to get around.

429
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,719
It's similar to how movie theaters are often on the top floors of malls.

430
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,490
When people head for the movies, they can stop by other shops.

431
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,490
Yes, exactly.

432
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,029
Sure, I'll talk to them.

433
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,109
Okay. Work on that. Talk to them.

434
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,349
I'll treat Engineer Zhang to dinner tonight.

435
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,150
Sure. It's about time. I should pick up my granny.

436
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,569
- Sure, off you go.
- I'll get going.

437
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:34,390
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

438
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,520
Granny, what should we have for dinner?

439
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,340
What do you want to eat?

440
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,290
I want... stir-fried beef.

441
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,710
Sure. Stir-fried beef it is.

442
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,730
Let's have stir-fried vegetables, too.

443
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,160
A'Yao.

444
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,070
Who brought over these glutinous rice cakes?

445
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,570
They're from Xu Hongdou.

446
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,549
We made rice cakes along with wine at Aunty Baoping's home.

447
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,340
Invite her over for dinner.

448
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,839
I tried. She refuses to come.

449
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,710
Why hasn't she come over for meals?

450
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,970
She said she's shy.

451
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,060
Why would she be shy?

452
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,920
Look at you.

453
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,010
Did she agree to be your girlfriend?

454
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh my goodness! Your girlfriend!

455
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,749
Go on. Invite her over for dinner. Hurry up.

456
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,560
What? Hold on, Granny.

457
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,239
If she shows up, don't probe unnecessarily.

458
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:09,319
Fine, I won't. It's just dinner. Why would I pry?

459
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,880
- Okay, fine.
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

460
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,200
Hongdou, what about A'Yao attracts you?

461
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,290
Everything about him is great.

462
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,070
Most importantly, he's handsome.

463
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,829
Why are you just like me when I was younger?

464
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,240
Is that so?

465
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,050
His grandpa was pretty dashing.

466
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,439
Even more good-looking than him! His eyes were big.

467
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:54,060
It's a pity we don't have any photos of him as a young man.

468
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,229
Granny! We aren't interested in stories between you and my grandpa.

469
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:01,049
I am! What happened after that?

470
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,300
In the end, he turned old and ugly.

471
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,600
When A'Yao grows old, he'll be even uglier.

472
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,400
Granny! You can be quiet,

473
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,409
but please don't do me a disservice.

474
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:18,170
I'll keep my mouth shut.

475
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,630
Let's eat.

476
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,900
Even uglier!

477
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,270
Granny, stop taking food for her! She can do it herself!

478
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,650
I haven't eaten with these chopsticks! They're clean!

479
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,010
That's not the problem.

480
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,799
Take a look at her bowl. The rice has been buried. It's a pile of meat and vegetables.

481
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,010
Focus on your own meal. Don't mind her.

482
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,620
Have some more.

483
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,220
She'll be stuffed.

484
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,210
This isn't much.

485
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,539
- When I was younger—
- When you were younger, you did physical labor.

486
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,350
It's not the same.

487
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,190
Here you go.

488
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,309
Granny, we only have so much beef to spare.

489
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,399
Please save some for me.

490
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,330
I still want to eat it. Eat this.

491
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,530
Give me the plate.

492
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,589
Why are you so selfish with food?

493
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,849
- Granny.
- This is new to me.

494
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:04,340
Am I really your grandson?

495
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,150
Here, this is yours.

496
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm all alone again.

497
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,780
Being in love is great.

498
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,199
Hello, Xiao Xin.

499
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,339
<i>Na Na, I'm sorry! I forgot to turn off the tap in the bathroom.</i>

500
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,130
<i>What should we do? Should I go over now?</i>

501
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,999
Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

502
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,330
Just stay at home. I'll do it.

503
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,900
What a mess.

504
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,650
What's wrong, Na Na?

505
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,639
It's the new employee. She's so careless.

506
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,170
I asked her to clean the counter before she leaves.

507
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,109
In the end, she forgot to turn off the tap.

508
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,410
She only called me after getting home.

509
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,539
Leave it to me.

510
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:26,400
- Stay outside.
- Let me do it. It's filthy.

511
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,599
I was on my way home, but I saw the lights on in here.

512
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,480
Thank goodness I came over to take a look.

513
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,540
Well, have you had dinner?

514
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,770
Not yet.

515
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,540
I can make you fried rice. Will that do?

516
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,259
Sure. Thank you.

517
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,680
No problem.

518
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,899
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

519
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,590
You can wear mine.

520
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,050
What about you?

521
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,639
Don't worry. I'm fine without shoes.

522
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,590
That won't do.

523
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,440
I don't have athlete's foot. Should I rinse them for you?

524
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,270
I'm not worried about that.

525
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,670
Just put them on. Girls are like flowers.

526
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,260
Recently, I realized you've grown up.

527
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,850
Even your sister said you're more composed than before.

528
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,930
That isn't a compliment. I'm 22 now!

529
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,100
I'm praising you.

530
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,180
Perhaps everyone goes through this.

531
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,140
We lose our childish ways unknowingly.

532
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,569
I used to think that you were similar to Chairman Xie's younger brother.

533
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:24,760
Right now, you're a proper man.

534
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,240
I... I've always been a man.

535
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,420
By the way, make me a Guan Yu sculpture when you have the time.

536
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,999
Make it with premium wood.

537
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
I'll put it in the lobby of our homestay.

538
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,730
No problem.

539
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,690
Well, if you're running the homestay with Sister Hongdou,

540
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,370
does that mean you're staying here?

541
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,410
Nope.

542
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,970
Isn't that so?

543
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,629
Nope. President Xu isn't just aiming to run one homestay.

544
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:58,620
We drafted the proposal for a chain of homestays.

545
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,640
One day, I might set up a new homestay in a different village.

546
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,780
As the deputy, I might be dispatched to a different branch.

547
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,399
You can go wherever you want to. That's admirable.

548
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:17,130
Xia Xia, if you have the chance,

549
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,599
you have to experience the world.

550
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,650
That way, you'll have a broader vision.

551
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,449
The business is pretty good now. I'm not focused on all that now.

552
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:31,699
But if you want to keep the business running, you must adapt to the ever-changing world.

553
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:37,550
Something that remains stagnant will be left behind.

554
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,410
Brother says the same thing.

555
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,520
So, brave young man,

556
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,919
struggle to find your way in a world that perishes.

557
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,700
Fight until the bitter end.

558
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,109
How is it? Does it taste good?

559
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,620
- Delicious.
- Eat up.

560
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,830
- Go on.
- I'm eating.

561
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,860
This street is really quiet, isn't it?

562
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,390
The alley over there also has many restaurants.

563
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,410
I see many local residents here.

564
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,190
Yeah, most of them live around here.

565
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,739
- This way.
- Okay.

566
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,030
After you.

567
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,400
<i>[Under Construction]</i>

568
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,629
Uncle, you know what? I trust you to be the foreman.

569
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,220
You've been in construction work for over 20 years.

570
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,109
The carpenters and bricklayers who work with you are experienced folks.

571
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:55,189
You even did an amazing job with our courtyard.

572
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,530
I was just doing my job.

573
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,340
My girlfriend didn't grow up here,

574
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,410
so she's not well-acquainted with the villagers.

575
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,609
Just call me if you encounter problems. I'll deal with it.

576
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,229
Sure. I'll gather my men.

577
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:10,190
Sure. Thank you.

578
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,700
President Xu. You have a parcel.

579
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,170
Is it from Yunnan?

580
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,110
Shandong.

581
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,889
- Thank you.
- Okay.

582
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,970
Pork is much cheaper now.

583
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,699
People are lining up at the market for minced meat to make sausages.

584
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,070
<i>Mom, it's summer now.</i>

585
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,719
<i>Sausages aren't meant for summer. Won't they go bad?</i>

586
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,410
Everyone's doing it.

587
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,899
Thanks to technology, the stores make them for us.

588
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,860
I just need to dry them at home.

589
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,230
I even put ice packs in your parcel.

590
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,299
Store them in the fridge. They won't go bad.

591
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,410
<i>Why did you send so much?</i>

592
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,640
<i>Did you pick up Xu Hongdou's bad habits?</i>

593
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,860
<i>I only sent 20 catties to you.</i>

594
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,209
<i>Hongdou asked for 40 catties and claimed that wasn't enough.</i>

595
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:26,529
Share your portion with your mother-in-law, your aunt, your colleagues, and your friends.

596
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,900
Give them out.

597
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,410
Mom, don't eat too many sausages.

598
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,940
Eat more fresh meat.

599
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,710
Yes, I got it.

600
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,909
There isn't any left at home. I've sent them to you.

601
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:42,740
By the way, what's the update on Dad's job?

602
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Did Li Yulin make arrangements?

603
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,170
<i>Yeah! Your dad is so delighted now.</i>

604
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,340
He's still eager to work.

605
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,829
He used to be self-employed and never had any colleagues.

606
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,879
Now, he keeps talking about his colleagues

607
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,710
and the people he met at the supermarket.

608
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,010
He never tires of talking.

609
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,960
<i>That's good news.</i>

610
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,850
<i>A good mood means good health.</i>

611
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,980
We really have to thank Li Yulin for this.

612
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,660
The millet looks great, right?

613
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,170
Look at the color. It's so yellow.

614
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,760
Do you know its origin?

615
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,820
It's from Qinzhou.

616
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,819
That's in Shanxi. This is millet of great quality.

617
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:31,260
If you make porridge with this millet,

618
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,689
- it'll have a thick texture and rich flavor.
- Is that so?

619
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:36,110
Would you like some? How much do you want?

620
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,219
- Get me two catties.
- Sure. Two catties, right?

621
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,840
Here you go.

622
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,829
All packed. Come this way.

623
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,180
Exactly two catties.

624
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,220
Really?

625
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,470
65306.

626
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,589
You know what?

627
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,220
My hands work just like weighing scales.

628
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,010
- Here you go. Two catties.
- Impressive. Thank you.

629
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,009
- Come back for more.
- Okay. Thank you.

630
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,930
Old Xu!

631
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,660
Old Hu!

632
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,879
Good to see you again.

633
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,229
Did you get the vegetables on sale?

634
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,620
- Of course.
- Great.

635
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,439
I didn't see you for shuttlecock kicking this morning.

636
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,919
I'm busy. Can't you see? I'm back in the workforce.

637
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:29,699
Is that necessary? You don't need the money.

638
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,029
I can't sit still.

639
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,149
My second daughter's classmate got this job for me.

640
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,570
You're wasting your retirement life.

641
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,509
You don't get it. I enjoy working.

642
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:40,569
- What can I get for you?
- I'd like some red beans.

643
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,439
My granddaughter wants to eat red bean buns.

644
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,960
Sure.

645
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,099
- Are two packs enough?
- Yeah, that's enough.

646
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,209
Old Hu, you kick shuttlecocks every day.

647
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:52,330
Don't your hamstrings hurt? Pig's trotters will do you good.

648
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,519
Cut it off. You never get tired, do you?

649
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,090
You're at home!

650
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,180
Granny, you're here!

651
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,900
Are you on your own?

652
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,810
My mom went to the fields.

653
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,289
Over here. Let me introduce her.

654
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:29,230
This is Xu Hongdou.

655
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,099
She took over the homestay next to your home.

656
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:35,149
It's being renovated now.

657
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:37,440
So, it might get a little noisy.

658
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,499
Hello. Nice to meet you.

659
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:40,930
Just call me Hongdou.

660
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,419
We'll be neighbors. We might bother you.

661
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,750
So, please tell me if there are any problems.

662
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,040
- It's fine.
- They're very nice.

663
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,820
Since this is our first meeting, I brought gifts for you.

664
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,539
- Don't bother.
- Just take them.

665
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:58,109
We've already brought them over. You have to take them.

666
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Thank you.

667
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,669
We'll get going.

668
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,470
- Goodbye.
- Watch your step.

669
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,090
Be careful.

670
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,950
Come on.

671
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,989
You can go back. Head in.

672
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:36,589
Take care, Granny.

673
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,940
- Bye-bye.
- Be sure to drop by.
- Sure.

674
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,370
Is he home?

675
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,510
I suppose so.

676
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,660
Grandpa Yang?

677
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,310
Grandpa Yang!

678
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,600
This bookstore will attract tourists and be highly profitable.

679
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,069
What's more, it'll open up dozens of job opportunities.

680
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,610
The sales of traditional handicrafts will be boosted as well.

681
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,260
That's more or less it.

682
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,970
Grandpa Yang, don't just listen to us talk.

683
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,860
What do you think?

684
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,410
What do I think?

685
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,150
Three words.

686
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,400
Not for sale.

687
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,580
We don't want to buy it. It's just a rental.

688
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,940
Three words. Not for rent.

689
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,090
Why not?

690
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,220
Four words.

691
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,740
I don't want to.

692
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,040
Grandpa Yang, there must be a reason.

693
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,669
No one's living in that old estate now.

694
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,219
Rather than leave it empty, renting it out will bring you quite a fortune.

695
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't you think so?

696
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,610
I don't need money.

697
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,379
My son gives me money. I don't need it.

698
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,739
What about your grandson? There are his university tuition fees to pay for. What if he gets married?

699
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,999
He'll need money.

700
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:07,860
A'Yao, look at yourself after you came back.

701
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,390
You, too.

702
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,610
A fresh graduate playing the village officer.

703
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,800
Take a look at you two.

704
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,130
You've been so busy.

705
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,930
What have you done to the village?

706
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,630
Tourism and development?

707
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,410
All those tourists come here with their cameras.

708
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,300
They take pictures everywhere.

709
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,549
What about now? A bookstore?

710
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:39,330
All you think about is making money!

711
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,130
You've heard me.

712
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,120
Three words. Not for rent.

713
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,749
Is that how Grandpa Yang sees us?

714
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:09,450
I didn't expect that either.

715
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,899
This is supposed to be a wonderful deal meant for the common good.

716
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:15,380
This is an unexpected problem.

717
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,600
It's okay. I'll discuss with his family again.

718
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,010
Sure. Do you have their contact numbers?

719
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,610
If you don't, I can look them up in the office.

720
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,600
Yang Guanjun must have it.

721
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,710
Okay.

722
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
Hongdou and Granny.

723
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,010
The homestay is under construction.

724
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:40,269
I asked Granny to show Hongdou around and greet the neighbors with gifts.

725
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,450
Hongdou!

726
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,850
Xinxin! What a coincidence!

727
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,970
Really? It's a small village.

728
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,760
- Are you done with the visits?
- We only have two families left.

729
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,630
Were you visiting Deqing?

730
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,070
Is he home?

731
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,579
Uncle Deqing isn't home now. Only Grandpa Yang is home now.

732
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:58,799
Don't go in right now.

733
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,550
Yeah. He's pissed off at us.

734
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,799
If he finds out about your homestay, he'd be furious.

735
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,319
He might even throw the gifts out.

736
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,790
You'll be cannon fodder!

737
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,819
Why is that? What did you tell him?

738
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,419
We asked about renting their ancestral home for the bookstore.

739
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:17,060
Let's talk about that later. Just skip his home.

740
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,239
There's another one left, right? Go to the next place first. Go on.

741
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,980
Hongdou, take the gifts in with me.

742
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,570
G-Granny.

743
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,400
- Granny.
- Don't go in.

744
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,410
Is Grandpa Yang home?

745
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,160
Shouldn't you go in to protect your girlfriend?

746
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,800
Granny can handle it.

747
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,799
<i>Grandpa Yang, we're leaving.</i>

748
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,830
Grandpa Yang even gave us some ribs.

749
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,130
What's the hassle?

750
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,989
We're off. The last family.

751
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,500
Should we have brought gifts?

752
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,080
I guess so.

753
