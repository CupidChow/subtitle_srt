4
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,200
How about I do it?

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,340
Don't worry.

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,660
Blanch the broccoli. The water is boiling.

7
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,080
You're so clumsy.

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
It won't spread out.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,280
Granny, you're up.

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,999
What are we having for breakfast?

11
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,340
Split pea soup and buns.

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
It's not nice if we don't invite the other courtyard tenants.

13
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,180
What are you doing? It's ticklish.

14
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,319
Accept reality. Give up on these fantasies.

15
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,060
Granny, what's this about accepting reality and giving up on fantasies?

16
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,959
That's what A'Yao told me yesterday.

17
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,239
Granny!

18
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,379
Haven't you washed your face?

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,200
- Wash up before eating.
- I did!

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,559
I washed it!

21
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,959
Why is there still gunk in your eyes?

22
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,959
You're the one with gunk in your eyes!

23
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,520
When he was young, he ate the gunk from his eyes.

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,240
Granny! I'm begging you!

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
Help!

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,359
All right! Off you go.

27
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll leave you two alone. Okay.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,120
Come on! Come on!

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,580
One latte and one orange juice.

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,080
A porcini pancake and a truffle pancake, right?

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,499
Okay, just a moment, please. Thank you.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,840
How about this photo?

33
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,800
Goodness. I've got an upset stomach.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,820
I shouldn't have drunk that cold brew tea.

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,979
Why don't you head back and rest?

36
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,060
There aren't many customers today. I can manage alone.

37
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,620
It's fine. I'll be better after a cup of hot water.

38
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,539
Xiaochun isn't here, right? I'll help you.

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
I'm touched.

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,200
Well, rest for a bit. I'll get you a cup of hot water.

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Thank you.

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,680
By the way, Hongdou,

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,720
Xiaochun is back to introducing girls to Chairman Xie again.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,620
What kind of girls?

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,719
A new novelty restaurant opened in town.

46
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,239
She's a female boss with curly hair,

47
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,120
like the female Hong Kong celebrities in the 1980s.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,380
Curly hair?

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,720
Like Wang Zuxian?

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,299
Yeah. Really fashionable and pretty.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,980
But Chairman Xia rejected her.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,600
He rejected?

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,820
Hongdou, what's your ex-boyfriend like?

54
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,800
Was he handsome?

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,699
Kind of handsome. He's pretty tall.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,480
My sister said he fell in love with me because he's blind.

57
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,840
Well, why did you break up?

58
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,939
We barely met, and our feelings faded.

59
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,740
How busy were you that you couldn't meet?

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,380
We lived too far away.

61
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm on the East Fourth Ring Road. He's on the West Fifth Ring Road.

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,200
We'll have to take a long subway ride to meet each other.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,620
My sister said that long-distance relationships are bound to fail.

64
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,020
Your sister sure is the nation's expert at dampening spirits.

65
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,360
Jia Baoyu was born with jade in her mouth.

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,620
My sister was born with a blade.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,679
When I return to Shanghai, I'll sneak into your sister's company

68
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,880
and see what she looks like.

69
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,040
I think my eyes are wonky.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,700
Everyone is starting to look like my sister.

71
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,960
Really?

72
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,640
A little.

73
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,320
Maybe all rich ladies have the same demeanor.

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,780
Mama, I think that person really looks like my aunty.

75
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,959
Are you done yet?

76
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,380
Yes, I won the game of chess.

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,919
Great. You can check if she's your aunty.

78
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Aunty!

79
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,400
Lingdang?!

80
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,119
Lingdang!

81
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,599
Aunty!

82
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,639
Why are you here, Lingdang?

83
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,680
Mama, it's really her!

84
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,060
You put on weight...

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,200
and turned tanner.

86
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
What a wonderful greeting.

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Thank you for your praise.

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Why are you here out of the blue?

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,180
I wanted to surprise you.

90
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,440
You should've told me.

91
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,399
I could send someone to pick you up.

92
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,980
No, thanks. The homestay has a shuttle service.

93
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,180
The homestay in town?

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,860
Can you stop playing with your mobile phone?

95
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,710
I'm working. I'm not playing.

96
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,840
Hold on, I'm almost done.

97
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,159
Send it to me in half an hour. Okay?

98
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,220
Waitress. The coffee is cold.

99
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,560
Waitress.

100
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,579
Not bad.

101
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,700
You're taking this volunteering gig pretty seriously.

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,800
When are you going back?

103
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
My holiday isn't over yet.

104
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,340
Honesty is the foundation of all virtues.

105
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,910
I called your hotel. They said you resigned.

106
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,100
How dare you lie to our parents about a three-month holiday.

107
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,240
I knew something was off about you.

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,399
I'm afraid that if they know about my resignation, they'll be worried.

109
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,040
I was planning to tell them when I go back.

110
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,440
Why did you resign?

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,700
I didn't want to work there.

112
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,080
Well, what do you want to do?

113
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Rest.

114
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Even if I'm a piece of gear,

115
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,020
I still need maintenance.

116
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,380
Have you got enough rest?

117
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,800
Are you done with your maintenance?

118
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
What are your plans?

119
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
I was doing well,

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,900
but your questions are dragging me back to the workplace.

121
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,380
It's like my superior probing me about the arrangments for the next quarter.

122
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,480
Why are you flaring up at a simple question?

123
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm not angry.

124
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Fine, I'll stop.

125
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,460
Aunty, do you want to have a bite?

126
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,400
No, thanks.

127
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,520
I'll take you to try some delicious braised chicken later. Okay?

128
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,040
- I'll take you and Mom—
- I don't want to eat chicken.

129
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Okay.

130
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,159
I have an important video conference tonight.

131
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,540
It'll be a very long one.

132
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,060
I can't have dinner with you guys. Look after her.

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,180
Okay. I'll take her for dinner and bring her back to you.

134
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,360
There's no need. Let her sleep with you tonight.

135
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,270
Here's her luggage.

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,499
Sleep with me?

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,520
Happy?

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,720
I want to sleep with you. I want to sleep with you, Aunty.

139
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,760
Yes, sleep with Aunty for the next few days.

140
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,020
So, you're here to find a nanny for your child?

141
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,319
If you don't look after your niece, who else would you look after?

142
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,460
Fine.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,140
Lingdang,

144
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,960
listen to Aunty. Don't run about.

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,360
Don't feed her weird stuff, okay? Please.

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
Got it.

147
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,660
All right.

148
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,140
I'm heading off.

149
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,859
Goodbye, Mom.

150
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,840
Goodbye.

151
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,820
The cafe waitress has been snapping photos of us.

152
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,600
Your phone has been vibrating endlessly.

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,679
Listen up. Don't speak ill of me.

154
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,860
Otherwise, the consequences will be dire.

155
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,440
Bye.

<i>[Girl Huang: Heh, successful assimilation with the citizens.]</i>

167
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,140
<i>[Girl Huang: What does Hongdou's sister work as? Does she have any resources to offer to us?]</i>

168
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>[Ma Qiushan: Exactly, what resources can she give me?]</i>

169
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,260
<i>[Girl Huang: Can someone kick this businessman out?]</i>

170
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>[Girl Huang: @Xie Zhiyao
Mai: @Xie Zhiyao
Nana: @Xie Zhiyao]</i>

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,160
What would you like for dinner?

172
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,500
- Maoduoli.
- Maoduoli?

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,560
What's that?

174
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,900
Mao... duo... li.

175
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,580
<i>[Dou: What's maoduoli?]</i>
Maoduoli.

176
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,700
Do you want to eat Maoduoli?

177
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,940
This won't do for a meal.

178
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,919
It's tamarind candy. Haven't you had it before?

179
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,780
Nope.

180
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,460
Have a taste.

181
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,479
Why did you sister come so suddenly?

182
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,420
Who knows what's wrong with her?

183
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,220
She found out I resigned, so she probably wants me to work in Shanghai.

184
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,920
Where do you want to work?

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
Back in Beijing.

186
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
You've made up your mind?

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I've lived in Beijing for over a decade.

188
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,500
I have to adapt to the air and food in Shanghai again.

189
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,840
I might as well return to Beijing.

190
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,280
Well... did you discover the life you want?

191
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,119
Right now, I can only use the method of elimination and eliminate the stuff I don't want.

192
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,580
That's still a method of sorts.

193
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,739
When I was in Beijing, I loved to go riding at the horse ranch in Huairou.

194
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:45,119
When I spent time with horses away from skyscrapers,

195
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,680
it was easier to find tranquility.

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,340
Didn't you go on dates?

197
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,600
What dates? After I graduated from university, I never had any girlfriends.

198
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,240
Why not?

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,119
My major had more male students.

200
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:00,920
The female students were either married or attached.

201
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,440
No, that's not what I meant. Why didn't you have any girlfriends after graduation?

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,280
Well... that girl went to Shenzhen.

203
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Moreover, my plans were to work for a few years,

204
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,380
accumulate money and experience, and return home.

205
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,900
Even if a girl fell in love with me,

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,960
they'd give up after hearing my plans.

207
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,600
Well... when was the last time you dated someone?

208
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,580
Five or six years ago.

209
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,200
Have there been no suitors ever since?

210
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,520
They'd either be my colleagues or my customers.

211
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,020
It's a hassle.

212
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,980
You just haven't met someone you're fond of.

213
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
Do you have sky-high standards?

214
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,760
I don't. It's fine as long as I like him.

215
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,700
What about income, having a car, and owning a house?

216
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,800
All those materialistic concerns, including family background.

217
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,439
It's better to have these, but totally fine if he doesn't.

218
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,320
He just has to be motivated.

219
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,600
Not having any requirements makes it even harder, you know?

220
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
Really?

221
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,300
Where are you planning to take your sister and Lingdang tomorrow?

222
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,639
Lingdang, where do you want to explore?

223
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,080
I want to see the baby horse.

224
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,780
The baby horse?

225
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,940
Uncle was also there.

226
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,700
The baby horse that Uncle helped to deliver?

227
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,079
Okay. I'll take you to see the baby horse tomorrow.

228
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,360
Aren't you busy?

229
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
Your sister finally came with her child.

230
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
It's probably more convenient to drive around.

231
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,900
I'll be your driver and guide.

232
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,340
Don't you have to welcome that bookstore owner tomorrow?

233
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Actually, everything's in place.

234
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,020
I don't know what time they'll come over anyway.

235
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,080
Don't worry. I have time tomorrow.

236
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,620
Okay.

237
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,360
We'll visit the baby horse.

238
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,580
Hey, we're here. Come on out.

239
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,720
Mama!

240
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,180
Sister, this is Xie Zhiyao. We call him Chairman Xie.

241
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,759
I know. Chairman Xie, the marriage seeker. Right?

242
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,470
- Nice to meet you, Sister Hongmi.
- Nice to meet you.

243
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,840
Just call me Xie Zhiyao.

244
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,260
The marriage proposal was just a joke.

245
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,320
Sorry to bother you today.

246
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,919
Not at all. By the way, please offer your valuable opinions on our tourist routes.

247
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,000
Hop in.

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,640
Get in.

249
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,540
How are you? Didn't sleep well yesterday?

250
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,019
I didn't get to rest. The sound insulation was horrible.

251
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,960
Mosquitoes and flying insects were everywhere.

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,820
The bedding was too shoddy as well.

253
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,220
It's uncomfortable.

254
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,120
This is the best homestay in the area.

255
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,140
Make do with it.

256
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,600
Sister Hongmi, do you have any places you want to go?

257
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,460
Are there any farms nearby?

258
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,360
Let Lingdang know about some crops.

259
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,260
I also want to pick plums.

260
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,180
Okay.

261
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,139
What vegetables are growing right now at your friend's organic farm?

262
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,040
Pumpkins, cucumbers, tomatoes. There's everything there.

263
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,280
Let's have lunch there.

264
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,980
They only serve two tables a day.

265
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,539
I have to ask in advance and let them know.

266
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,220
Well, ask right away.

267
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,760
The roasted beef they make in the self-built pizza oven is really tasty.

268
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay, let me ask.

269
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,520
Mama, are those chives?

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,679
That's wheat.

271
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,639
What's wheat?

272
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,500
Wheat is what your grandma uses to make buns.

273
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,840
Xu Hongmi, don't teach her the wrong things.

274
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,100
That's rice.

275
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,960
Isn't that wheat?

276
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,800
No, it isn't. This place only produces rice, corn, and glutinous corn.

277
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,020
It's really delicious.

278
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,039
Lingdang, look over there. That's a rose field.

279
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,840
Roses?

280
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,700
Those roses are ugly.

281
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,599
Sister, these are edible roses.

282
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,200
The roses we see at the florist are Chinese roses.

283
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,160
Chinese roses?

284
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,239
I remember you picked the Chinese roses at Grandma's house and you got spanked, right?

285
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,280
I picked the roses at Uncle's house.

286
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,400
The flowers at Grandma's house were oleanders.

287
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Really?

288
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,020
I remember they were Chinese roses.

289
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,420
This is lemon balm. Smell it.

290
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,440
Doesn't it smell refreshing?

291
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,559
It smells like mints. What is this?

292
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,419
These are rose geraniums. Smell it.

293
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,820
It smells like roses.

294
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,420
Smell this.

295
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,440
It's rosemary.

296
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,199
Smells gross.

297
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,519
All right. Let's ditch the rosemary.

298
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,660
We'll use two other herbs for tea.

299
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,300
Mama!

300
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,600
♫ <i>There are stars in my journey, there are rainbows</i> ♫

301
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,279
It's okay. Let's look at something else.

302
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,980
Be careful.

303

It's so cold!

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,360
Is it?

309
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,859
Come on. Take this.

310
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,400
Bring it over to your mom.

311
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,280
This one, too.

What are you looking at?

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm looking at Xu Hongmi. She's like a fool.

321
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,079
I'm telling you, I don't know.

322
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,980
Anyway, you... you get it done for me.

323
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Life isn't easy for your sister.

324
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,360
Even on a trip with her child, she still has to work.

325
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,640
I really don't know why she's here.

326
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
She's worried about you, so she came to check in on you.

327
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,820
You don't know her.

328
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,720
She isn't here because she's worried about me.

329
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,780
She came here to lecture me.

330
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,080
Is that how you view her actions?

331
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,820
Hear this. We grew up together.

332
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,480
I know Xu Hongmi's true nature the best.

333
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,199
Even as a child, she strutted about domineeringly.

334
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,399
She never looked back.

335
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,140
I always hurried after her, but I could never keep up.

336
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,060
She always said I was slow.

337
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,800
But you're really like sisters.

338
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,580
Usually, in a family with two children, their personalities would be complementary.

339
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,680
If one is tough, the other would be gentle.

340
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,220
If one is lively, the other would be quiet.

341
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,780
One is worrisome, while the other isn't.

342
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm the worrisome one.

343
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,560
So what if you're worrisome?

344
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,520
It's nothing much.

345
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,820
Well, which would you prefer?

346
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,660
If they're my children, I'd love them both.

347
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm not joking.

348
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,770
For parents, if a child is sensible and outstanding in everything,

349
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,500
that'd be a real blessing.

350
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,480
However, a worrisome child is normal.

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,160
If you don't want any worries, why give birth to a child?

352
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,100
Human cubs are the most difficult animals to raise in the world.

353
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,039
The essence of mankind is its contradictions and double standards. Don't you agree?

354
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:28,319
The stuff you learned from books, your speech, and your actions are worlds apart.

355
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,920
We're just being educated to be fair and just.

356
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,160
However, no matter how nice you make things sound,

357
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,719
you'll still be biased toward the one who fits your preferences and aesthetic tastes. Right?

358
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,700
That's for sure.

359
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,180
We might as well think more rationally.

360
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,599
Who doesn't like a person who is good-looking, outstanding, and has a good personality?

361
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,180
Have you ever heard of someone looking for a partner

362
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,760
who earns less but works more,

363
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,160
is too busy to interact with, has a stubborn personality,

364
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,840
and is unwilling to change themselves?

365
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,900
That's me.

366
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,500
You don't think very highly of yourself.

367
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,899
In my eyes, you're the one who is good-looking, outstanding, and has a good personality.

368
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,840
You, too.

369
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,620
Don't bother consoling me like that.

370
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm stating the truth.

371
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,220
Go there to play?

372
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,759
As the saying goes, "You're already here." "Cheer up."

373
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,899
Okay. I'll cheer up.

374
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,280
I'm listening.

375
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,200
All right. Send me the proposal tonight. Okay.

376
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,080
Does your phone still have battery?

377
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
Does your phone still have battery?

378
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,580
Nope.

379
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,600
But I have a power bank.

380
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,180
I even brought two.

381
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,320
Do you need one?

382
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,440
My phone still has four-fifths of its battery.

383
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,680
Is this the life of unemployment?

384
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,299
Aunty!

385
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,379
A dog.

386
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,240
Yes, a dog.

387
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,219
That's the boss's dog.

388
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,820
It's called Dragon Fruit.

389
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,000
Do you want to play with it?

390
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,079
No, stop. Don't touch it.

391
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,080
If you're scratched or bitten by a dog, you'll need an injection.

392
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,580
You don't want that, right?

393
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,759
Besides, this dog hasn't been dewormed.

394
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,239
There are different bacterias in dogs and humans.

395
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,980
Okay?

396
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,379
Let's ignore your mom. She's an old hag.

397
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,900
Let's play with the dog.

398
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,600
Let's play.

399
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,300
I'll take a photo of you.

400
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
- Sister Hongmi.
- Hold on.

401
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,840
You can rest assured.

402
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,940
Dragon Fruit is very docile.

403
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,780
How can I let my worries rest? Do you have children?

404
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,920
I don't have a child, but I've been a child.

405
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,259
You should let children play with everything and have nothing to fear.

406
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,600
Come on.

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,440
It's fine.

408
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,600
All right.

409
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,740
I'll hold you guys responsible if she's bitten.

410
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,560
Don't worry.

411
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,520
I'll take a video for you two.

412
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,180
Look here.

413
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,660
<i>Xu Hongdou!</i>

414
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>Don't let it lick her hand!</i>

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,680
<i>Don't worry. She can wash it later.</i>

416
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,120
That's not hygienic, though.

417
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,100
No wonder Mi is so anxious.

418
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,259
Why doesn't she do something else with her child?

419
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,560
She's the same as how she was as a child.

420
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,090
She's always fooling around.

421
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,730
When she visited her grandma's house,

422
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,570
it was like letting the tiger return to the mountains.

423
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,039
She's insanely obstinate.

424
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,720
If you forbid her from doing something, she'd be bent on doing it.

425
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,400
She changed a lot in the past few years.

426
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,160
It's obvious that she has settled down.

427
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,760
One's personality is clear at three years old.

428
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,320
She's still obstinate and refuses to listen to advice.

429
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,440
Her mind is full of mischief.

430
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,220
You were the one who made her go to Shanghai.

431
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,160
Weren't you the one who wanted her to go there?

432
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,320
I wanted her to stay at home.

433
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,899
Please, don't. She'd only piss me off.

434
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,199
Dou has been resigned for so long,

435
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:16,700
but she doesn't tell us what her plans are.

436
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,820
As her mom, why aren't you asking her about this?

437
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,420
You're her dad. Why don't you ask?

438
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,570
You're making me ask because you don't want to. Right?

439
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,280
You just want to remain the good guy.

440
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,590
Did I give birth to this daughter on my own?

441
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,779
Look! You're annoyed the moment I mention this.

442
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,700
I'm discussing this with you.

443
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,760
You don't sound very cordial about this.

444
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,040
All right, Chief. What should we do?

445
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,239
Nothing.

446
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,940
Since she doesn't want us to know, we'll be ignorant.

447
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,340
Let's wait for her to come back.

448
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,159
Are you sure she's your daughter?

449
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,559
Nope. I kidnapped her at the hospital entrance.

450
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,659
Look at you.

451
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,199
What? I'm making dumplings to feed ignorant pigs.

452
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,760
How long can Mi and Dou last before they start quarreling?

453
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,180
Two minutes.

454
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,780
Hold this and eat it.

455
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,579
Aunty, wipe my mouth.

456
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,119
There's no need. Wipe it after you're done eating.

457
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,939
Does it taste good?

458
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,880

487
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,499
Granny, I have to go to the village committee to have a meeting with the village director and the secretary.

488
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:52,400
What's the matter?

489
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,939
It's about the bookstore.

490
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,760
I'm off!

491
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,720
<i>[Meeting Room]</i>

492
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,040
Why are they coming so suddenly?

493
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,320
The village hasn't even organized a cleaning session.

494
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,959
He said it was President Liu's private trip.

495
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,639
He's passing through here on his family trip to Lijiang.

496
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,239
So, they'll drop by for a few days.

497
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:14,220
He even said not to alert the village leaders.

498
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,500
This is... an ambush.

499
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,400
He said he'd come with a team, but he's bringing his family over now.

500
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,599
How are we supposed to receive them?

501
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,479
He already said not to alert the village leaders.

502
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,220
Let's not receive them personally.

503
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
The secretary is right.

504
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,040
The reception we prepared won't work.

505
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,599
How about we answer this ambush with our own tricks?

506
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,260
Let's run with a private reception.

507
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,880
Me, Xiao Huang, and one other staff member of mine.

508
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,099
We'll take them wherever they want to visit.

509
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,859
We'll help them view whatever they want to.

510
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,320
- I agree. A'Yao, I'll count on you for this.
- Okay.

511
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Okay, I'll wash my hair and get the clothes from Ms. Xie.

512
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,160
- They should've been tailored by now.
- Please don't do that.

513
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,719
Wear your usual clothes. Just make sure you look neat.

514
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,440
So, we're ditching those clothes?

515
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,979
It's a private trip. Such formal attire isn't appropriate.

516
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,320
That's true.

517
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,220
I'll go and wash my hair.

518
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,039
I'll make the necessary preparations.

519
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,079
Go ahead. Call us when necessary.

520
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,099
Rest assured.

521
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,480
Okay.

522
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,080
An ambush?

523
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,300
Wait. Today, I planned to take Lingdang and my sister to the Old Town.

524
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,140
It's fine.

525
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,880
I'll get them to explore on their own.

526
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay, bye.

527
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,660
What's the matter?

528
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,539
The owner of Shaohua Bookstore is visiting today.

529
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,500
He called just before he boarded the plane.

530
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,039
Why is everyone visiting at the same time?

531
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,120
Exactly.

532
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,180
Friends!

533
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm leaving!

534
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,079
Are you leaving now?

535
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,179
I'm off!

536
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,760
Where are you going?

537
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,879
Beijing.

538
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,380
For a live house.

539
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,719
Didn't you read the group chat?

540
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:58,980
Damai keeps talking about her dog in the chat.

541
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,380
Goodness, Damai.

542
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,580
She left, but she's more lively than when she was around.

543
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,219
Her chat messages are like a flood.

544
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,880
All right, get going.

545
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,960
Okay.

546
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,059
I'm leaving!

547
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,940
I'll bring Dao Village snacks back for you guys.

548
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,420
Just remember to bring yourself back.

549
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,859
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.

550
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,600
Lingdang, have your breakfast. I have a task to complete today.

551
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,720
Here they are.

552
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,400
- You're Xiao Huang, right?
- Yeah.

553
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,900
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Assistant Zhang.

554
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,299
Darling, be careful.

555
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,400
Let me introduce them. This is President Liu.

556
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,880
- She is his wife, Sister Jing.
- Hello, Xiao Huang.

557
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,260
- Hello, President Liu and Sister Jing.
- Hello.

558
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,440
This is the entrepreneur who returned to our village, Chairman Xie Zhiyao.

559
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,779
Nice to meet you, President Liu.

560
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:56,539
Please don't call me that.

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,420
I'm older than you guys, so just call me Brother Liu.

562
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,800
Sure, Brother Liu.

563
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,460
This is Xu Hongdou. She's our volunteer.

564
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,340
Brother Liu. Sister Jing. Just call me Xiao Xu.

565
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,040
This is the cold brew tea from Chairman Xie's cafe.

566
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,760
<i>[Wind]</i>
Have a taste. The trip must've been tiring.

567
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
- I can just pass it to you, right?
- Thank you.

568
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,020
- Thank you.
- Xiao Xu, you don't have to be so courteous.

569
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,979
We're on a private trip this time, so let's not talk about work.

570
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:17,279
We'll only be staying here for a day.

571
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,039
We'll be heading straight to Lijiang tomorrow morning.

572
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,199
Of course.

573
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:24,180
Since your family is traveling here, you're our guests.

574
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,120
We'll make sure you enjoy local delicacies and have fun.

575
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,280
Sorry to trouble you then.

576
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,580
Not at all. We're glad that you're here.

577
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,500
Is there a stroller in the trunk?

578
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,439
- Yes. Come with me.
- Okay.

579
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

580
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,180
I'll take you to the homestay first. We can visit the Old Town later.

581
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,999
- Okay.
- Sure.

582
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,759
This town is only one kilometer away from our village.

583
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,100
The tourists here can stroll right over to our village.

584
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,859
- That's really near.
- Yes.

585
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:52,439
Last year, the roads were widened.

586
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,339
It used to be a one-way path.

587
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,259
During farming seasons, when two harvesters met,

588
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,040
they'd have to cross the fields to drive through.

589
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,919
The buildings here are very distinctive.

590
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,179
They reveal traces of time.

591
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,019
Yes, exactly.

592
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,339
All of them are old buildings.

593
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,140
After preservation renovations, they retain their original styles.

594
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,860
They are exactly how they were before.

595
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,019
What motivated you to be a volunteer here?

596
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,120
Me?

597
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,259
I'm here on holiday.

598
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,319
I've been here for many months.

599
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,420
Since I'm here, I just help out in whatever way I can.

600
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,240
Do you like this place?

601
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,799
The weather is great here.

602
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,799
There are clouds in the daytime. There are stars at night.

603
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,520
Interpersonal relationships are simple as well.

604
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,540
Yes.

605
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,660
I feel the same way.

606
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,720
Well, invest in this place.

607
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,199
I'm just an assistant.

608
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,960
I don't call the shots.

609
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,380
<i>The road is uneven. Be careful.</i>

610
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,700
<i>Okay.</i>

611

<i>That one looks good.</i>

612
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,700

Come on. Friends from afar. I raise a toast to you with tea instead of wine.

628
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you.

629
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

630
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,020
Xiao Huang, the promotional video you sent over was pretty appealing.

631
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,379
It conveyed cultural richness, and the scenery was gorgeous as well.

632
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:03,480
Right?

633
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,339
All the actors are from our village.

634
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,660
If I hadn't met you guys, I would've assumed professional actors were hired.

635
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,199
But my first impression of Xu Hongdou and Chairman Xie was that you were a real couple.

636
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,599
No, we aren't.

637
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,679
We were just playing along with the plot.

638
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,480
Yes.

639
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,420
Xu Hongdou is just a tourist here.

640
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,079
How long have you been here?

641
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,760
More than two months.

642
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Are you are you very fond of this place?

643
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,940
She likes it here.

644
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,279
He has become your spokesman.

645
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,620
Let her speak.

646
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,820
Actually, I came here because it's a relatively unpopular spot.

647
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,740
Other places are too crowded.

648
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,960
When searching online, everyone seems to have visited these places. Right?

649
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,679
The photos all look similar.

650
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,319
There isn't a shred of novelty.

651
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:50,139
Yes.

652
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,420
An unpopular place is relatively more spacious.

653
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,879
Actually, I didn't harbor much hope at the beginning.

654
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:57,160
After all, it's an unpopular place.

655
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,320
There must be a reason for its lack of popularity.

656
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,839
When I arrived, I found that the development and planning here

657
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,500
was relatively slower than other more popular villages.

658
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,919
Other spots have already gained popularity.

659
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,439
It's like a restaurant.

660
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:18,539
A longer queue will attract more customers, right?

661
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,399
What about a new restaurant?

662
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:25,659
Actually, it needs some publicity and a signature dish that can be presented at the door.

663
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,820
Yes.

664
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,720
A signature dish.

665
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,499
This restaurant should match its dishes.

666
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,360
For example, fish head with chopped peppers represents Hunan cuisine.

667
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,900
Boiled fish should be in a Sichuan restaurant.

668
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,380
So on and so forth, right?

669
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,680
Your food is ready!

670
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,880
- Make some room.
- Here you go.

671
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,039
- Sour papaya fish.
- Thank you, Aunty Hua.

672
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,580
- You're welcome.
- Enjoy.

673
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,670
Sour papaya fish must be in a Yunnan restaurant. Right?

674
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,319
Of course.

675
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,100
Come on, Brother Liu and Sister Jing. Try it.

676
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,420
The sour papaya fish here is completely different from other places.

677
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,300
See if it's to your taste.

678
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,800
<i>All right.</i>

679
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,980
<i>It's beautiful!</i>

680
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,160
<i>Come on.</i>

681
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,339
<i>Okay.</i>

682
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,880
<i>Change your pose.</i>

683
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,440
<i>Okay.</i>

684
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,139
Our head office is in Xicheng District.

685
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,600
Which hotel are you planning to work at?

686
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,799
I'm not in a hurry.

687
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:29,460
Before I return to Beijing, I'll spend some time with my parents.

688
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,140
That's good.

689
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,380
Actually, it's the same for me.

690
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,580
I don't have much time to go home.

691
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,100
Xu Hongdou!

692
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,340
Come here!

693
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,960
Excuse me.

694
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,680
What's the matter?

695
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,540
What are you talking about? You two keep chatting.

696
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,490
He has many questions, and he's a curious guy.

697
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,180
He's very talkative, and we're just chatting.

698
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,740
Give me some details.

699
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,500
When did I arrive? What do I like here?

700
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,520
How are the folk customs here?

701
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,100
Why did you work as before?

702
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,000
Why did you invest here? How is your business going?

703
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,180
What are the interesting spots nearby?

704
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,640
Are there many tourists here?

705
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,079
What about President Liu and his wife?

706
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,160
What did they say?

707
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,940
They're having fun. They take photos

708
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,800
and don't ask a single thing.

709
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,300
No wonder this guy has his eye on you.

710
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,779
I knew something was off.

711
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,639
In the hotel industry, I've met so many guests on business trips.

712
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,839
No assistant would speak more than the boss during a meal.

713
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,460
Check his identity.

714
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,200
But I don't know his full name.

715
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,100
He added me on WeChat.

716
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,440
H-He added you on WeChat?

717
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,060
<i>[Z.M.Y: I'm Z. M. Y. Shaohua Bookstore, Zhang Mingyu.]
[Dou: Xu Hongdou]</i>
Shaohua Bookstore, Zhang Mingyu.

718
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,340
Zhang Mingyu.

719
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,560
There's really a guy named Zhang Mingyu on Baidu Baike. Is this him?

720
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,280
<i>[Zhang Mingyu, Chief Designer, Shaohua Bookstore]</i>
Chief Designer of Shaohua Bookstore.

721
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,620
What should we do next?

722
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,599
If you know yourself and your enemy, you need not fear a hundred battles.

723
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,800
If he's trying to worm information out of you, do the same to him.

724
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,620
Okay.

725
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,440
I'll try beating the trees and check if any dates fall.

726
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,000
All the best.

727
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,580
I'm counting on you.

728
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,240
Okay.

729
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,020
I'll try my best.

730
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,620
Go back and have a good rest. Don't harp on this.

731
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,019
They're leaving early tomorrow morning.

732
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,640
We've done everything necessary.

733
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,899
I'm too tired to think. Let's review this tomorrow.

734
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,999
Thanks for sending me home today.

735
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:36,959
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

736
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:39,380
- Bye-bye.
- Be careful on your way back.

737
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,120
Let's go.

738
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,659
Sorry for today.

739
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,740
You should've been spending time with your sister.

740
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,280
It's nothing.

741
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,740
If I were with her, she would've just spent her time on calls.

742
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,760
Are you okay?

743
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,180
There's a pit.

744
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,520
Oh, there's a pit.

745
