3
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,190
Brother, it's raining.

4
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,610
What's with the sudden downpour?

5
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,900
Granny, quickly keep everything!

6
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,620
It's raining!

7
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,070
- A'Yao, I've to go home. The beans...
- What?!

8
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,990
The beans are drying in the yard!

9
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,200
Granny, don't go! Help with packing!

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm going home to take in the clothes!

11
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,580
Granny!

12
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,706
Take an umbrella with you!

13
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:49,040
Don't get drenched!

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Be careful!

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,940
Brother, I told you!

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,680
We should erect a canopy!

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,000
It'll block out the sunlight.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,160
Hurry up!

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,820
Be careful!

20
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,850
Mr. Ma, an idea struck me.

21
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,740
I'm inspired.

22
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,330
Should it be a fast or slow song?

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,740
I agree, a fast tempo is good.

24
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,490
Great minds think alike.

25
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,020
It was such a crucial moment.

26
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,380
So typical of men...

27
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,800
She's getting sick of it, too.

28
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,530
Take this.

29
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,050
Hello, Bingnian.

30
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,270
I agree.

31
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm willing to be your cyber lover

32
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,090
and never part with you.

33
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>[Bingnian (Confession Target)]
Don't talk bullshit with me. Who the hell are you?</i>

34
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,500
Little Sister Bingnian, nice to meet you.

35
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,660
I'm Hu Youyu.

36
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,570
We exchanged WeChat contacts at the pub.

37
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,800
You said I sang excellently,

38
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,270
and you adored me.

39
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>Sorry, I drank too much that day.</i>

40
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,140
<i>Let's unfriend each other.</i>

41
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,600
<i>[Hi, how about giving this a second thought?]</i>

42
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,860
<i>[You are no longer friends with this contact.]</i>

43
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,640
<i>[Xie Zhiyao: Are you free tomorrow at noon?]</i>

44
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,540
<i>[Granny wants to invite you over for a meal]</i>

45
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,580
<i>[and wants to know your favorite foods.]</i>

46
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:49,380
<i>[I'm fine with anything. Granny doesn't have to fuss over me.]</i>

47
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:57,620
<i>[It's no fuss at all. Lunch is settled then. Good night.]</i>

48
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,660
Xu Hongdou!

49
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,250
Let's go to the morning market in town.

50
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,540
Let's get some cherries.

51
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,130
Hello.

52
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,190
Hi.

53
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,840
The cherries are very sweet. Have a taste.

54
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,800
Have a bite.

55
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,950
I don't feel like eating it.

56
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,720
I changed into clean clothes this morning.

57
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,980
Try it.

58
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,970
Buy some if you like it.

59
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,660
Are you still in dreamland?

60
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,920
- Buy them.
- I want two catties.

61
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,230
Sober up.

62
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,380
-Two catties, please. How much per catty?
- ¥8.

63
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,220
- I want ¥15 of cherries.
- Okay.

64
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,590
- I'll take these then.
- See you.

65
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,050
Is there anything else you want to eat?

66
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,570
What vegetables do you eat in Beijing? Let me buy you some.

67
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,940
How much is the broccoli?

68
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,450
- ¥2.
- ¥2 per catty?

69
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,090
Let me take a look around.

70
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,810
Those carrots look nice.

71
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,040
I'll buy some carrots for Cutie Pie.

72
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,240
- How much are they?
- ¥3 per catty.

73
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,550
- Okay.
- I'll pack it up for you.

74
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,120
I don't need a bag. You can put them in here.

75
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,710
Okay.

76
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,580
Why are you so sleepy?

77
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,080
How do you even wake up for work?

78
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,210
I don't have work today.

79
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,380
You woke me up early in the morning and dragged me to the market.

80
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,480
Will it kill you if you don't make others miserable?

81
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,150
You can ask my granny.

82
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,750
She wants you to eat at our home, but doesn't know what you like.

83
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,771
So, she asked me to bring you along.

84
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,220
I told you I can eat anything.

85
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,330
Only a pig eats anything.

86
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,730
You're bent on torturing me.

87
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,730
Listen up.

88
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,970
The small pot rice noodles with fresh meat here are one of the best in town.

89
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,590
After 8:30 a.m., you can't even buy a bowl.

90
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,870
A'Yao, your rice noodles are ready.

91
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,330
Coming.

92
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,174
Since it's your first time having this, I'll make you a local sauce.

93
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,620
Here you go.

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,170
Your chopsticks.

95
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,820
- Miss, your rice noodles are ready.
- Okay.

96
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,250
Can we get takeaway?

97
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,080
I want to bring some back for Damai and Na Na.

98
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,190
Nope.

99
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,960
You visitors just love to order takeaways.

100
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,770
Dining in is basic respect for the rice noodles, got it?

101
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,520
Let's have a talk.

102
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,810
I know it. There's no such thing as a free breakfast.

103
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,350
What is it?

104
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,570
Well...

105
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,480
You're rather congenial to me.

106
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,270
After spending time with you,

107
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,730
I think you're especially kind and nice.

108
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,570
- What the heck?
- Most importantly, my granny loves you.

109
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,090
Hold on.

110
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,590
Let me finish.

111
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,950
Can you let me speak first?

112
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,130
We barely know each other.

113
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,480
I don't know you well, and neither do you know me well.

114
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,920
I won't stay here for long.

115
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,380
I'm not a libertine either.

116
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,190
I'm very serious about my romantic relationships as well.

117
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,070
I reject all cyber romances and long-distance relationships.

118
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,050
Well...

119
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,950
Yes, you're outstanding and nice.

120
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,900
I'm done.

121
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,520
You can go on.

122
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,410
Of course, it'll be better if you don't continue.

123
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,120
I'm great at rejecting others.

124
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,940
Did my speech sound that much like a love confession?

125
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,770
The crux is that you behave like a dog who spotted a steamed bun.

126
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,310
It's natural that I jumped to that conclusion.

127
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,490
I wasn't like that.

128
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,040
Anyway, it's just a misunderstanding.

129
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,100
Jokes aside, can you help me?

130
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,670
You can state your conditions.

131
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,750
Why must it be me?

132
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,360
I can't help much.

133
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,720
Look. Our employees are the uncles, aunties, and grannies in the village.

134
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,550
Most of them are uneducated.

135
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,080
They don't have much service awareness either.

136
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,070
I made them undergo training, but that was too basic.

137
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,310
We have to be more adaptable.

138
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,160
I won't let you be a waitress. That'll be a waste of talent.

139
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,860
I just want you to observe the situation.

140
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,490
You just have to identify and resolve any issues.

141
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,440
We need your valuable advice.

142
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,060
You can conduct a customer survey.

143
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,970
I did. The customers demanded better service.

144
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,410
Do as they say.

145
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,300
You know, you chased after that dine-and-dasher

146
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,910
and looked so haggard after that.

147
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,890
However, you smiled without a trace of anger.

148
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,380
You even made sure he wasn't embarrassed.

149
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,520
Why?

150
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
In the service industry,

151
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,760
establishing good affinity is crucial in boosting a business.

152
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,250
Exactly, that's service awareness.

153
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,270
You have 10 years of experience in hospitality.

154
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,370
You're radiating one thing.

155
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,190
Experience.

156
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,950
But I'm clueless about training employees.

157
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,250
You don't have to.

158
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,440
Just identify the problems.

159
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,670
Your meals will be covered.

160
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,100
We have tons of good food and interesting places here.

161
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,250
For example, tourists don't know about that rice noodle store we ate at.

162
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,994
I guarantee you'll have the time of your life and a pleased stomach in the following days.

163
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,540
What do you think?

164
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,920
As a volunteer, how can I have the time of my life?

165
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
Work can never be fun.

166
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,170
Don't try to dupe me.

167
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,350
I'm out.

168
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,970
Xu Hongdou. Think it over.

169
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,700
State your conditions. I'll try to meet them.

170
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,980
Give it a thought.

171
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,430
It won't take much of your time.

172
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,570
State your conditions.

173
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,370
I'll try to meet them.

174
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,780
You're wavering, aren't you?

175
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,940
A'Yao was a really naughty boy.

176
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,100
Every time I spanked him, he'd flee.

177
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,170
I chased him around the village

178
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,610
with a stove poker in my hand,

179
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,730
but I couldn't catch him.

180
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,770
He was spanked?

181
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,670
Of course.

182
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,870
What a troublemaker.

183
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:11,870
His best friends were Yang Guanjun and Xie Qiang.

184
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,300
The three of them were a real handful.

185
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,810
They stole eggs

186
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,080
and burned the beanstalks of other households.

187
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,950
They would even get into fights with their classmates.

188
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,250
People would come knocking at our door all the time.

189
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,020
We have an old saying in my hometown.

190
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,090
“Children at seven or eight years old are the bane of the world."

191
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,020
That's true.

192
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,340
He's much better now.

193
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,820
He's filial.

194
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,680
He even became a boss,

195
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,870
but it's a tough life.

196
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,420
All these years, he hasn't even made a penny.

197
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
He invested all the money he earned.

198
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,040
He even loaned money to invest in... infrastructure construction.

199
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,960
I don't understand.

200
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,980
We're not a rich family.

201
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,010
His dad and aunty sell flowers in Kunming

202
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,290
to make ends meet.

203
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,310
All an old hag like me can do

204
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,220
is to not bother him.

205
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,770
He had a hard time paving his way.

206
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,370
Watching him live like this tortures me with worry.

207
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,560
I can't even fall asleep every night.

208
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,650
Granny, don't worry.

209
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,180
Investments are necessary in a business.

210
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,050
A'Yao is so outstanding and capable.

211
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,150
He'll be fine.

212
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,360
I'm anxious because I can't help him.

213
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,250
He put in such great effort in his business.

214
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,580
Many of his employees watched him grow up.

215
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,150
He can't chide them even if they make mistakes.

216
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
Don't worry too much.

217
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,550
All in all,

218
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,490
it's my fault.

219
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,930
At my age, I need others to look after me,

220
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,640
but I don't want to go to Kunming alone.

221
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,690
If I could care for myself,

222
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,970
A'Yao might still be working in Beijing.

223
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,600
- It's all my fault.
- Granny, it's okay.

224
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm old, useless, and a burden.

225
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,780
Don't think so.

226
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,840
Are you done peeling the garlic?

227
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:54,290
- What're you talking about while holding hands?
- You...

228
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,170
It's nothing.

229
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,600
Are you done cooking?

230
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,770
Granny, you invited her over for a meal,

231
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,590
but I bought groceries in the morning and I'm cooking now.

232
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,220
You're even nagging me to be faster.

233
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,490
Here you go. Thanks.

234
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,880
Is Chairman Xie at home?

235
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,950
Yes, I am!

236
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,230
Granny.

237
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,140
Xiao Huang is here.

238
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,830
You have a guest over?

239
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,980
She's Xu Hongdou, a tenant in our courtyard.

240
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,453
She's Huang Xinxin, the Village Director's assistant.

241
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:19,580
"Xinxin" from "thriving prosperity."

242
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,820
She's a college graduate working as a village official.

243
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,140
Nice to meet you.

244
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,180
Welcome to our village. Call me Xiao Huang or Xinxin.

245
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,190
Xinxin. Okay.

246
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,810
Aren't you done with distributing these yet? Didn't I send Xia Xia over to help you?

247
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,410
We distributed these yesterday, but some villagers weren't home.

248
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,490
So, I distributed them again with Xia Xia today.

249
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,280
He went home to rest.

250
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,417
You came just in time. I just finished cooking. Eat with us.

251
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,500
No, thanks. I've eaten. I'm here to talk business with you.

252
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,850
How about you attend to your guest first?

253
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,260
She's not a guest.

254
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,380
Granny, make Xiao Huang a cup of tea.

255
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,500
No, please don't. I'll take it myself.

256
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,980
Granny, I'll make myself at home.

257
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,860
Hongdou, help me take out the dishes.

258
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,860
The opera theater in the village is run down.

259
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,930
For a building with over a century of history,

260
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,180
it's better to utilize it after protective restoration then leave it to ruin.

261
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,360
How can it be used?

262
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,910
Should we set up an opera troupe?

263
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,750
Unique folk performances are the answer.

264
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,390
I heard that the villagers would sing and perform operas during festivals.

265
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,680
That was a long time ago.

266
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,490
I remember Aunty Feng and Uncle Chang used to perform Lantern Operas when they were younger.

267
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,000
However, if the opera theater can be reused,

268
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,100
it's bound to be a tourist attraction here.

269
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,060
Yes, that's what I'm aiming for.

270
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,820
What do you think?

271
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,920
It's worth a shot.

272
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,040
You support gives me confidence.

273
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,210
I'll think it through and prepare a plan for the village committee.

274
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,990
Okay. Discuss it at the village meeting.

275
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,420
If there are budgeting issues, I'll figure something out for you.

276
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,690
That's exactly what I thought.

277
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,000
Xiao Huang, eat with us.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,830
It's fine, Granny. My stomach's full.

279
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,510
You're getting thinner.

280
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,010
Really?

281
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,740
When I video chatted with my dad, he also said so.

282
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,450
How long since you graduated and came here?

283
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,190
It's my second year here.

284
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,560
When I just arrived here, I was utterly ignorant.

285
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,860
At that time, Chairman Xie had already returned to set up his business.

286
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,270
He helped me tons.

287
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,650
That's not true. You contributed loads for our village projects.

288
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,210
That's my job.

289
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,680
Right now, our partnership is flawless.

290
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,110
How long are you planning to stay here?

291
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,730
I won't leave.

292
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,160
Can't village officials leave after two or three years?

293
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,300
Yes, I can,

294
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,490
but this place is bubbling with potential.

295
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,440
This is just the beginning.

296
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,480
Do your parents approve?

297
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
My dad's an educator in Guizhou

298
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,170
because my mom's a headmaster in a village.

299
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,650
All three of us are Party members and comrades.

300
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,320
We're striving hard in our passions. We don't have to let others dictate what we do.

301
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,720
I made a promise with Chairman Xie.

302
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,620
We'll join hands to make Yunmiao Village an arts and cultural village.

303
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,900
That's our common aspiration.

304
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,660
Aspiration?

305
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,270
That's right. An aspiration.

306
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,277
Didn't you start a business for profit?

307
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,650
These goals align.

308
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,800
If developments proceed smoothly, villagers will have more job opportunities.

309
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,069
Prosperity should be shared.

310
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:21,160
We can make money in society and give back to society.

311
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,140
A virtuous cycle.

312
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,580
Hongdou, what's your aspiration?

313
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,290
My aspiration is to have a peaceful and happy life.

314
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,200
That's more like a dream.

315
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,040
What's the difference between a dream and an aspiration?

316
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,540
They're very different.

317
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,730
You strive for your aspirations,

318
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,370
but you harbor hope for your dreams.

319
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,510
The former requires action. The latter only requires occasional effort.

320
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,690
These are worlds apart.

321
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,730
What's your aspiration?

322
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,970
My aspiration is to become a person worthy of living.

323
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,640
You've already fulfilled that.

324
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,270
Everyone's existence is valuable.

325
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,010
Only confident people can assume that.

326
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,650
As for me, the only thing I know is to write.

327
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,610
I don't want to do anything else either.

328
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,150
There are hundreds of thousands of web novelists in China.

329
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,880
Most of their works are like a stone thrown into the ocean.

330
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
They can't even make a ripple.

331
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,940
They're even scolded for polluting the internet with trash.

332
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,250
So, I often think an unpopular writer like me

333
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,950
is just one person in a crowd.

334
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,100
Am I really talented?

335
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,290
Is there any value to my existence?

336
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,840
Don't think that way.

337
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,350
There's no doubt about your talent.

338
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,580
I didn't say all these to earn your consolation or your encouragement.

339
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,910
I'm just expressing my contemplation process.

340
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,620
So, what's the result of that contemplation?

341
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,950
It's impressive. I didn't reach any conclusion.

342
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,440
While I doubted myself, I continued moving forward.

343
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:11,600
What about you? What's your aspiration?

344
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,740
You don't have any?

345
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,850
What about dreams?

346
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,130
Becoming rich?

347
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,100
Rich?

348
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,140
That's a common dream for many.

349
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,371
What's your plan after becoming rich?

350
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,210
I'll retire.

351
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,880
Retire?

352
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,290
What are you planning to do?

353
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,780
Must I do something?

354
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,650
Let me put it this way.

355
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,190
Have your parents retired?

356
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,400
My mom's a housewife.

357
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,640
My dad ran a produce shop before.

358
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,590
Two years ago, the street where his shop was got demolished.

359
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,133
My sister stopped him from continuing.

360
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,150
I guess he's retired.

361
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,760
What're they doing every day?

362
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,870
My dad practices tai chi and calligraphy every day.

363
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,640
Last year, he renovated the house.

364
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,650
He goes fishing at the reservoir twice a week.

365
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,480
My mom goes to the market every morning and tries out recipes.

366
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,170
She also plants vegetables with my aunt in the countryside.

367
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,680
A few days ago,

368
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,096
she told me she was selected as a promotor for waste sorting in the community.

369
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:20,540
They have to keep themselves occupied.

370
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,280
That's precisely it.

371
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,090
Retirement isn't a dream. It's a fantasy.

372
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,740
Many youngsters fantasize about living idly after retirement.

373
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,950
That's nothing but a fantasy.

374
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,300
Humans can't be idle.

375
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,460
If you're hungry, you want to be full.

376
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,760
Once you're full, you want to enjoy good food.

377
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,840
When you have a content life, you'll have mental needs.

378
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,820
You'll desire status and respect in society.

379
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,940
You'll achieve self-actualization by helping others.

380
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,450
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

381
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,980
In that case, my parents's needs are specific.

382
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,720
My mom wants to raise my child when she retires.

383
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,310
My dad wants to enter an elderly college to improve himself.

384
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,720
He also wants to help in raising my child.

385
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,750
Both of them just want to look after my child.

386
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,350
You know that this is the ideal life for many seniors.

387
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,809
They want to look after their grandchildren.

388
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,760
I'd better find a boyfriend first.

389
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,660
However, my current life is exactly what I want.

390
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,970
I traveled across the mountains and seas to get here.

391
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,010
Hongdou, what kind of life do you want?

392
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,140
I didn't even have a life.

393
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,040
I'm here to figure out...

394
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,810
what kind of life I really want.

395
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,400
<i>I'm anxious because I can't help him.</i>

396
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,480
<i>He put in such great effort in his business.</i>

397
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,780
<i>Many of his employees watched him grow up.</i>

398
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,340
<i>He can't chide them even if they make mistakes.</i>

399
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:11,930
<i>I made a promise with Chairman Xie.</i>

400
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,760
<i>We'll join hands to make Yunmiao Village an arts and cultural village.</i>

401
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,310
<i>That's our common aspiration.</i>

402
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,610
<i>These goals align.</i>

403
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,750
<i>If developments proceed smoothly, villagers will have more job opportunities.</i>

404
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,081
<i>Prosperity should be shared.</i>

405
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:26,230
<i>We can make money in society and give back to society.</i>

406
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,940
<i>A virtuous cycle.</i>

407
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,650
<i>My aspiration is to become a person worthy of living.</i>

408
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,000
<i>In fact, being occupied with anything</i>

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,960
<i>is better than stayed cooped indoors</i>

410

♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

412
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,300
Granny.

413
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,140
Is this temperature all right? Should I make it hotter?

414
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,390
- Just a little.
- Okay.

415
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:08,960
♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,

Who's that?

421
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,590
A volunteer.

422
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,700
Granny, you're brilliant.

423
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,440
Everything's a piece of cake for you.

424
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,370
You taught me well. I have to say

425
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,810
I was so worried. I couldn't sleep every night.

426
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,470
It's the truth. You didn't lie,

427
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,080
but I didn't get you to say you're old and useless.

428
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,690
You wept and thumped your chest.

429
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,060
That's your own improvisation.

430
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,690
You aren't the boss of me.

431
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,560
I can do what I want.

432
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,140
Fine, enjoy your footbath.

433
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,210
- I'll call Xiaochun.
- Go ahead.

434
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,880
Go ahead.

435

♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

437
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,510
Did you wait for long?

438
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,160
I just arrived.

439
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,670
You look pretty today.

440
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,070
You told me to dress formally.

441
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,890
Yes, it's wonderful.

442
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,100
I'll be upfront about this. Don't have high expectations of me.

443
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,030
I don't know if I'll be of any help.

444
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,340
I can pay you.

445
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,450
That won't do.

446
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,550
I'll be a proper employee. You'll really be my boss.

447
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,830
I didn't come here to work.

448
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,080
Volunteering is fine. All I need is free meals.

449
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,780
I drafted some suggestions and plans for improvement last night.

450
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,460
Are you interested?

451
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,540
Let's talk while walking.

452
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,570
One, don't commit evil. Two, persistence is key.

453
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,990
Stick to the three rules of etiquette and four ordinances of virtue.

454
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,350
Stay away from five devilish types of people.

455
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,210
From now on, Xu Hongdou will officially join our cafe

456
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,790
as a voluntary consultant and manager.

457
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,510
No, temporarily.

458
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,100
She'll temporarily join our cafe.

459
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,360
Welcome her with a round of applause.

460
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,780
<i>Welcome, Xu Hongdou!</i>

461
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,300
<i>You're now a temporary cafe staff!</i>

462
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,790
<i>Welcome Xu Hongdou!</i>

463
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,550
<i>You're now a temporary cafe staff!</i>

464
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,950
Thank you.

465
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,410
Over this period of time, I've frequented the cafe often as a customer.

466
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,860
I noticed problems with the service, the working process, staff management,

467
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,020
and work allocations.

468
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,020
However, these aren't major problems.

469
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,180
The greatest advantages of our cafe are the pleasant environment

470
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,290
and its delicious menu.

471
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,010
I'm just offering suggestions as a cherry on top.

472
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,580
I'll make concrete suggestions to everyone

473
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,170
and cooperate with everyone

474
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:48,900
to strive for quality enhancement in the service of our cafe in a short time.

475
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,840
Thank you.

476
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,590
Well said.

477
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,410
The cafe opens from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.

478
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,120
The staff should report in by 9:30 a.m.

479
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,300
to make checks and preparations before the cafe opens.

480
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,020
However, I noticed the staff only arrives at 10:00 a.m.

481
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,310
The grannies arrive even later.

482
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,500
That's true.

483
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,180
But Na Na makes preparations the previous day before leaving work.

484
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,770
The grannies leave after the cafe's tidied up.

485
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,020
So, it's acceptable.

486
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,710
In reality, the grannies often come to work late and leave early.

487
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,100
Many times, Na Na closes up the cafe alone.

488
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,790
I've already told them before, but they're too old to remember.

489
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,500
Na Na also said whoever's free can get the work done.

490
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,800
There's no need for strict work allocation.

491
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,920
We aren't a family business

492
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,270
where people come and go at will

493
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,800
since there'll always be someone around. We have to be strict about this.

494
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,910
Okay.

495
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,680
It can get busy, but I can manage.

496
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm fine with helping out.

497
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,020
Customers visit this place to relax.

498
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,410
A short wait is fine.

499
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,420
They aren't in a rush to finish their coffee and leave.

500
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,890
Well, whenever I'm at the cafe,

501
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,000
why do you always serve others first when it's crowded?

502
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,790
I arrived first.

503
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,880
I'm also a customer, aren't I?

504
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,350
That's because...

505
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,250
What's the reason? Is it because you don't want other customers to wait?

506
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,240
Granny Caiyun, you wipe the tables, chairs, and shelves with the same rag.

507
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,750
That's unsanitary.

508
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,510
The rag is washed very cleanly.

509
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,370
I do the same with the rags at home.

510
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,710
Wiping different areas with separate rags is more hygienic.

511
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,650
Customers will think we're hygienic if they see this, and they'll feel reassured.

512
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,250
All right?

513
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,830
Buy rags of different colors.

514
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,540
I told Xiao Qin. She'll bring them over right away.

515
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,040
<i>[- Xiao Qin, bring over rags of different colors]
[- Okay]
[- Let me know the price.]</i>

516
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,840
Pretty lady, could you repeat yourself?

517
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,450
What do you want me to repeat?

518
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,280
How should I go about the cleaning?

519
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,140
Granny Caiyun's a bit forgetful.

520
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,400
Okay.

521
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,430
My legs hurt after being on my feet for long.

522
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,180
A'Yao knows this as well.

523
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,210
When I was young, my legs were frozen in a cold paddy field

524
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,030
when I was transplanting seedlings.

525
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,190
Now, I'm getting old. It's an inevitable problem.

526
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,680
I must sit down after standing for a while.

527
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,450
Make sure you take good care of yourself.

528
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,120
Are you getting chummy with A'Yao?

529
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,015
Getting chummy?

530
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,420
She's talking about dating.

531
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,700
- No—
- Yes, dating.

532
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,880
Granny Xiuying, I'm not his girlfriend.

533
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,110
We're having a meeting.

534
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,960
A'Yao should have his own family soon.

535
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,730
All he does is wander around the village with no plans of having children.

536
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,100
Ridiculous.

537
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,610
Guanjun already has a son and a daughter.

538
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,020
Jiabao is already in junior high school.

539
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,990
Does Yang Guanjun have a daughter in junior high school?

540
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,530
His eldest daughter is called Jiabao.

541
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,410
She attends school downtown and lives with her aunt.

542
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
Wait! Let's get back to the point.

543
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
What else are we supposed to be talking about?

544
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Look at your age.

545
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Hurry up and get married.

546
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Have a child soon.

547
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Otherwise, Guanjun will be a grandpa

548
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,000
before your child even attends elementary school.

549
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,700
Staff management's difficult.

550
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,000
Now, it's a little complicated.

551
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,600
The rules at your hotel reception are out of place here.

552
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,200
It's mainly because we're all relatives

553
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,500
and acquaintances in the same village.

554
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,900
Private and business matters are intertwined.

555
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,500
We can't function without rules,

556
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,100
but sticking too strictly to the rules doesn't work either.

557
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,200
I think I'm better off being a waitress.

558
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,600
You don't have to do that.

559
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,200
I have to work at the front line with them.

560
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,400
We have to clean and carry out daily tasks together.

561
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,700
They're too shabby.

562
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,300
They must be taught step by step and corrected slowly.

563
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,900
It has to become muscle memory for them.

564
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,300
This is a unique situation.

565
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,200
We have to deal with it differently, right?

566
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,800
Someone was in sullen silence all the way here.

567
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,700
I thought she was scared off.

568
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,600
Nah, I'm even more piqued.

569
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Are you that fond of challenges?

570
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,800
I won't seek out challenges,

571
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,100
but I never retreat in the face of them.

572
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,000
Very cool.

573
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,100
Well, what were you thinking about in that silence?

574
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I was wondering if I fell into a trap set by you and your granny.

575
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Granny and I?

576
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Granny doesn't seem like a grumbler,

577
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,700
but she lamented loads to me yesterday.

578
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,400
Did you instigate her?

579
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
No way.

580
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,200
You asked for my advice,

581
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,100
but you knew about all the problems.

582
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
You just want an outsider like me

583
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,400
to play bad cop for you, right?

584
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
That's definitely not true.

585
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,600
I enlisted your help to be the good cop.

586
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
You're a grand hotel manager from Beijing.

587
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Once dressed formally, you have authority over these ladies.

588
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,700
They trust you.

589
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,600
Visiting monks give better sermons.

590
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,400
It's a universal truth.

591
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,800
Aren't you also educated outside this place?

592
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
I'm just a local when I'm back here.

593
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,700
The food seems to be taking some time.

594
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,800
Let me hurry them.

595
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,100

Miss, I'll clear your plates.

607
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm sorry. Just sit down.

608
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,900
Leave it to me.

609
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,400
Miss, it didn't spill on you. Right?

610
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,900
Nope, there wasn't much left in the cup.

611
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,500
Let me get you another one.

612
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,200
Do you want the same drink or a different one?

613
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,200
- I want an Encounter.
- Encounter. Okay.

614
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
One Encounter.

615
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,100
Okay.

616
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,400
Hongdou.

617
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,600
Why are you giving her another drink?

618
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Granny, you knocked over the drink.

619
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,600
There was only a bit left.

620
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
She wouldn't even drink it.

621
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,500
Even if there's only a bit left, she hadn't finished it yet.

622
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,400
We have to be responsible for our mistakes.

623
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
But...

624
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,200
Granny, can you take photos with the customers?

625
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Photos? I don't look good in photos.

626
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,300
You look gorgeous. You and your clothes are pretty.

627
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,200
Pass the plates to me.

628
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Okay, look here.

629
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,600

These are freshly-baked butter cookies. You can have a taste.

641
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Wow, thanks.

You're welcome.

643

- Yeah, that takes at least three hours.
- Exactly.

Okay.

647
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
Grannies! You...

648
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,500
It's half an hour before work ends.

00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,900
If you're busy, ask Xiaochun for time off.

650
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,600
If Xiaochun's not around, let me know.

651
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,100
You can't just leave.

652
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,200
I...

653
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,500
We'll ask for time off now.

654
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,100
Why do you have to leave early?

655
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,600
The television repairman is coming over.

656
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,100
Chuchu wants to have braised chicken.

657
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,400
Do you have children at home?

658
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,200
Yes. She works at A'Yao's warehouse.

659
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,400
See you.

660
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Bye.

661
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
Xu Hongdou!

Xu Hongdou!

663
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,600
Come with me.

664
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
What's up?

665
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
I'll introduce you to a friend.

666
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,000
A friend? You want me to go?

667
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,700
A very important friend. Let's go.

668
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,800
Where are we going?

669
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,500
The horse ranch.

670
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Damai, would you like some time?

671
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,400
Who is this?

672
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,200
You're not asking me to entertain customers, are you?

673
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,200
No, I haven't seen them before either.

674
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,300
Wait.

675
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm better acquainted with their mom.

676
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,400
Their mom is gorgeous.

677
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,700
She has large eyes and long lashes.

678
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,200
You'll understand when you see them. Get on.

How's it going?

682
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Soon.

683
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,100
Is everything going well? Pretty much.

684
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,600
Great. Have some tea.

685
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
- Drink up.
- Thanks.

686
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
- What's going on?
- Come here.

687
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Come over here.

Is this the friend you were talking about?

692
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,600
She's the pretty mom of our new friend.

693
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,000
She does have big eyes and long lashes.

694
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
I didn't lie to you, right?

695
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,000
Have you seen a horse deliver a foal?

Once she lies down, the foal will be on its way soon.

699
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,400
Will she be in any danger?

You have a very important task.

710
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
You have to record the time of the foal's birth.
