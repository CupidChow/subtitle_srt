You even learned to cook?

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,380
When you visit me during the holidays, cook for me.

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,240
Who told you that I'm not picky? I'm a very picky eater!

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,400
I don't care. You have to cook.

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,520
If you won't cook for me, don't bother visiting.

00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,860
Xiao Huang!

10
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,120
Uncle Deqing.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,500
I'm busy. I need to hang up.

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,939
Uncle, I was just planning to speak to you about the old house today.

13
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,799
Xiao Huang, I want to talk to you about the place too.

14
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,580
I've thought this through.

15
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,000
Our situation is unlike those well-developed areas.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,759
I shouldn't have requested such a high rent.

17
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,719
Yes.

18
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,240
When you first came here,

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I thought a young lass like you wouldn't accomplish much.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,120
Things are different now.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
All the villagers are like your minions.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,020
Minions...

23
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,999
What a unique compliment!

24
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,320
You're young but ambitious.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,900
I think you're promising. You're a great official.

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,379
Well, I'll leave that matter in your hands.

27
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,879
You can negotiate the rent.

28
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,880
I'll let you decide what an appropriate rate is.

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
I have complete trust in you.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,800
I just want to contribute to the village.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,540
Hold on, Uncle.

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,179
This old estate belongs to Grandpa Yang.

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,800
The contract also needs to be signed by Grandpa Yang.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,920
Our agreement doesn't matter.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,079
Xiao Huang, negotiate the rent.

36
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,480
- I'll deal with my dad.
- That won't do.

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,580
I can only settle the rent after you convince your dad.

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,300
If Grandpa Yang refuses to sign the papers, my efforts will be in vain.

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,600
I might as well work on the land allocation.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,639
Forget about that. There's no need for allocated land.

41
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,760
I'll speak to my dad.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,880
Fine. I'll leave this task in your hands.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,380
Sure.

44
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't try to get a plot of land while I'm working hard.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
I have to be prepared for all situations. We can work on both simultaneously.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,300
There's no need for any preparations.

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,020
The villagers will have opinions about the allocated land.

48
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,880
Rest assured. This is no problem at all. I'll get going.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,200
Uncle Deqing. All the best!

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
It's all in the palm of my hands.

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,720
In your hands!

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,640
Take care!

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,020
Hello, Old Xie.

54
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,059
Let me tell you something.

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,759
Uncle Deqing is so frazzled.

56
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,860
He came to the village committee to see me.

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm not lying!

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,440
I think there's hope for this.

59
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Are you exercising?

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,140

Kids, you sang excellently!

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
During the performance, don't be nervous.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,800
Just sing as you usually do.

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,820
Today, we should also thank Mr. Hu for practicing with us again.

72
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,660
Let's thank Mr. Hu together.

73
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,500
<i>Thank you, Mr. Hu!</i>

74

You're welcome. You guys sang really well.

75
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,319
Mr. Hu!

76
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,140
What's wrong, Xiao Hu Lu? MInd the steps! Be careful!

77
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,900
What's the matter?

78
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,860
Mr. Hu, do I sing well?

79
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,840
You do.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,040
Can I stand in the middle?

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Xiao Hu Lu, here's the thing.

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,170
The middle spot isn't always the most important or the best.

83
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,120
In a choir, everyone is important.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,670
Don't just think about shining alone.

85
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,680
When I'm in elementary school, I won't stand in the middle.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,900
I can stand in the back.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,360
Why?

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,379
My grandparents are coming to the performance.

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,600
If I don't do well, my mom will be blamed.

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,240
Your mom will be blamed?

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,860
My grandparents think the schools here aren't good.

92
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,080
They want me to go to a school in Kunming.

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,560
I have to do well in everything.

94
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,480
If I'm in the middle, my mom can let me study here.

95
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,080
Is this what your mom told you?

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,260
When Mom called Dad, I overheard them.

97
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,500
Mr. Hu, help me.

98
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,519
Luo Xiaoqiao! Why are you here? Class has started.

99
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,780
You can go to class first. Let's talk about this later.

100
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,200
What are you gripping Mr. Hu? Let's go to class.

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,280
Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,500
Goodbye.

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,280
- Let's go.
- Listen to class.

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,679
Na Na. Coffee.

105
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay, Mr. Hu. Give me a minute.

106
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,319
Mr. Hu, I went to the bar to watch you yesterday, but you weren't at work.

107
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,360
I had a day off yesterday.

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,260
We'll go again tonight. Will you be there?

109
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,560
Yeah, I will. I'll buy you a drink if you come.

110
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,860
Great. It's a deal. Love you.

111
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,639
Na Na, the cafe seems crowded today.

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,640
Where's Xiaochun?

113
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,700
I think she's busy with the warehouse.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,120
Hasn't the town been bustling lately?

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,540
I guess so.

116
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,719
I think it's because...

117
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,479
that travel vlogger's video sent in the WeChat group went viral.

118
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,900
People who watch that video want to come here and take a look.

119
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,460
Do you think so?

120
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,960
Probably.

121
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,320
What's wrong? Why are you so listless?

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,460
Look at you. Chat with me.

123
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,900
Fresh cold brew tea.

124
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,640
My treat.

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,340
Why are you still treating me so coldly?

126
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,360
Brother, can't you see that I'm busy?

127
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,000
If you want to chat, go to Sister Manjun.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Aren't you two dating?

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,800
We... We aren't dating.

130
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
We... Is this just a fling for you two?

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,170
It's nothing!

132
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,600
We're just a room apart.

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,480
You didn't even bother being quiet.

134
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,339
Do your best at work. Cheer up.

135
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,400
You should get back to work.

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,220
You... Your tumbler.

137
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,760
All the best.

138
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,980

139

<i>[Xiaochun, I want a two-week break to visit my parents in Shanghai.]</i>

140
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,600
This color is gorgeous. I want to dye a skirt.

141
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,319
Okay. I'll dye it for you.

142
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,480
I'll dye a few more so you have a few options.

143
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,199
I think the homestay's staff can wear tie-dyed clothes. What do you think?

144
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,959
No problem. I'll get someone to make them for you.

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,660
Sister!

146
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,979
- Xiao Qin, are you here to hang out?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,379
Candy!

148
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,200
Uncle A'Yao.

149
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,619
Sister Hongdou, you're also here.

150
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm here to help out.

151
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,979
Uncle a'Yao, why is Trekking Luo Li so awesome?

152
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:41,739
I heard Yang Zhinan say that the town's homestay is fully booked for the weekend.

153
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:44,040
People are still calling to make reservations.

154
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,360
Fully booked for the weekend?

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,719
His homestay isn't the only fully booked spot.

156
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,879
The other place in town used to charge ¥120 a night,

157
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,299
but their prices have been changed to ¥220.

158
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,719
That place is also fully booked.

159
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,280
Is this place going to go viral?

160
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,880
Uncle A'Yao, what do you need my help with?

161
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Hang these up.

162
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.

163
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,060
There is an evident increase in tourists lately.

164
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,639
The homestays in town are fully booked for the weekend.

165
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,100
Moreover, there are visitors who drive over from neighboring cities.

166
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,740
We're here to discuss an emergency plan

167
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,500
to get through this weekend with a tourist boom.

168
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,840
We have to avoid tourists flooding this area.

169
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,240
If they can't dine well or have fun, they'll leave this place upset.

170
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
We have a village committee meeting this afternoon.

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,000
The places visited by Luo Li in her video are definitely must-visit spots for tourists.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,419
So, let's make those our focus.

173
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,400
For meals, that'll be Galsang Flower Restaurant.

174
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,120
Be sure to notify them to prepare more ingredients and hire more temporary helpers.

175
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,200
For the wood carving workshop, the cafe, the tie-dye workshop, and the embroidery workshop

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,640
should also have sufficient manpower. We have to prepare more materials as soon as possible.

177
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,479
How much is enough?

178
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,400
Xiao Huang will collate data on tourist numbers in the Old Town

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
and other popular towns in recent years.

180
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,280
She'll also gather the reservation numbers of the homestays in the town and village.

181
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,960
We'll have a preliminary estimate of the tourist flow.

182
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,100
Got it.

183
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,040
Actually, I'm mostly concerned about the limited capacity of our reception infrastructure.

184
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,819
Exactly. When the infrastructure can't meet the customer flow,

185
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:12,600
the service staff will never be enough.

186
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,760
We can't remain in our own shoes and insist that others be considerate of us.

187
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,500
Instead, we should adopt the customer's perspective and solve problems for them.

188
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,680
How should we think from the perspective of customers?

189
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,100
The want to be seen. They want problems to be solved.

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,819
They want to be respected and valued.

191
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:32,040
What exactly should we do?

192
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,760
Chairman Xie and I will draft a plan.

193
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,720
We may need many people.

194
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Let's see who has the time in the village.

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,540
We can get them to help out.

196
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,319
Okay. I'm on it. I know the villagers' schedules best.

197
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:46,700
Okay.

198
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,840
Sister Xiaochun,

199
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,800
about the rest days I mentioned...

200
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,580
Can you take a break after this weekend?

201
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,560
We really need manpower now.

202
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,660
Even Hongdou and the rest have to help out.

203
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,680
- But I...
- What's the matter? Is it your parents' birthday?

204
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,100
Isn't your parents' birthday in February? Right?

205
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,080
I'll let you take a break next week.

206
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,540
Why is everyone so on edge? Isn't this a blessing?

207
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,040
We've been working hard for so long just for this day. Right?

208
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,140
If we want to catch the gift of fate,

209
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,820
we have to be able to bear its weight.

210

321
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,320
Hello, what would you like?

322
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,580
A cup of Peach Blossom and a cup of Thousand Fragrances.

323
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,880
Why are there queues everywhere?

324
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Wait a minute.

325
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,379
Sorry, it'll take longer to get a seat here today.

326
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,600
However, you can enjoy a 20% discount for takeouts.

327
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Moreover, the cafes in the area are good as well. They aren't very far away.

328
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,260
- You're in that video, right?
- Yeah.

329
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,040
- You were the one riding the horse by the seaside.
- Yeah.

330
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,680
- Yeah, she was in it.
- You're really sharp. I only showed up briefly.

331
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,780
- Is the person with you your boyfriend?
- Yes.

332
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,420
- You guys are a great match.
- Thank you.

333
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,280
- Can we take a picture with you?
- Of course.

334
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,080
One, two, three. Thank you.

335
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,520
- We'll order takeout.
- Okay. This is the menu.

336
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,400
You can have a look.

337
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,940
What about that Granny? Can we take a photo with her?

338
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,800
Sure. She's inside. Please come inside.

339
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,799
Come with me. Excuse me. Thank you.

340
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,720
Take a picture for us. Thank you.

341
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,540
<i>All right. Three, two, one. Look here. Say cheese.</i>

342
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,620
<i>Okay. Another one. Okay.</i>

343
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,920
<i>- Nice.
- Thank you, Granny. Thank you.</i>

344
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,579

Is Granny Caiyun all right?

354
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,780
She's fine, just tired. Think about what happened.

355
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,659
People have been taking photos with her all day long.

356
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,440
She's old, so she's worn out.

357
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,260
It's the same with Uncle Xiangdong. He's having acupuncture in the hospital. For his arms.

358
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,040
What's the matter with Na Na? She's asleep from exhaustion.

359
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm here to check in on you guys.

360
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,090
Based on the homestay reservations in town, this flood has passed.

361
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,380
Even though there are many reservations next weekend,

362
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,010
tourists won't flood over like this.

363
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,940
If there's another wave, even I'll break down.

364
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,780
It must've been hard on you guys.

365
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,540
Xiao Huang, you're here too!

366
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm here to thank you guys. What's wrong with your voice?

367
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,080
I've been talking all day. So, my voice got hoarse.

368
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,819
No way. Why do you smell like that?

369
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,580
Do I still smell like garbage?

370
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,940
How much floral water did you spray on yourself?

371
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,039
Not much. Just a little.

372
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,880
Come here quickly.

373
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,240
Stop talking. Take a break.

374
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
I can help you clean up.

375
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,600
Don't do that. Your voice is already in this state.

376
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,180
Drink some water.

377
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,880
You're in the line for the hospital.

378
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Xiaochun, you should rest as well.

379
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,079
I'm fine. I'll tidy up.

380
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,500
Xiaochun, you don't seem very tired.

381
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Help Hongdou clean up.

382
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't seem tired?

383
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What made you think so?

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Go on.

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,700
Drink water.

386
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm not tired.

387
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,900
Old Xie, even you have someone who worries about you now.

388
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm going to use the megaphone

389
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,200
and make an announcement around the village.

390
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,700
The village leaders will lead the whole village to pick up garbage and clean up.

391
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Are you coming?

392
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,800
Tomorrow morning, I need to pay the temporary workers' wages.

393
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
I can't join you.

394
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay, I won't bother you.

395
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
What's the matter? Did you have a nightmare?

396
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
You're drenched in sweat. Quick, drink some water.

397
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Have some water.

398
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,700
That's quite a thick stack.

399
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,200
Uncle A'Yao, I'm here for my salary!

400
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,800
Hongdou, you're also here.

401
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,200
- I came to hang out.
- Daxia.

402
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm not done calculating Xiao Qin's wages. I'll calculate our dear Xiao Qin's one first.

403
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,800
Dear Xiao Qin?

404
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
If you want to woo me, get your number and line up.

405
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,100
Don't worry. I'll go when I'm done.

406
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,300
I'm not in a hurry. I'm free today.

407
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,800
Is your shop closed today?

408
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah. Even if I keep it open,

409
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,200
my dad will say I'm wasting my time.

410
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Xiao Qin's salary is ¥100 a day

411
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,800
plus six hours of overtime pay.

412
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
A total of ¥290.

413
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,700
¥290.

414
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll round up the numbers for you. ¥300.

415
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Uncle A'Yao, why have you become so generous?

416
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,200
You used to bargain with me just for light bulbs.

417
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Being a consumer and a boss is different.

418
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,500
That's a horse of another color.

419
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,400
I might as well work for you.

420
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I didn't even earn ¥300 last week from selling goods.

421
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
I want to buy a pair of shoes for Yang Zhinan.

422
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,000
Buy shoes for Yang Zhinan?

423
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,100
Have you ever bought shoes for your dad?

424
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,200
I won't buy that for him. He scolds me all the time.

425
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Hongdou, when is your homestay recruiting staff?

426
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Let me work as your service staff.

427
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
Don't be driven by impulse.

428
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,500
When your dad intended to close your sundry store,

429
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,800
didn't you insist on keeping it open?

430
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,500
I don't want to man a store.

431
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,200
I just didn't want to learn embroidery.

432
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,500
I have nails under my butt, so I can't sit still.

433
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
With your temper, you can't work as a service staff.

434
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,700
What's wrong with my temper?

435
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,200
If you meet impolite guests,

436
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,800
what should I do if you end up in a fight?

437
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,500
I won't beat people up.

438
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,300
At most, I'll quarrel with them.

439
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,800
Besides, I'm very enthusiastic.

440
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,400
I talk a lot. I can chat with anyone.

441
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Even if foreigners come and there's a language barrier,

442
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,100
I can chat through gestures.

443
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,900
Talkative. That's right.

444
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,300
You're talkative, too.

445
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm just a retailer of words, while you're a wholessaler.

446
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
You blabber more than I do.

447
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Be quiet. I'm calculating money.

448
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,700
He's calculating money.

449
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,400
It's a plus if you're enthusiastic and chatty.

450
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,800
How about you think this through carefully?

451
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,900
If you really wish to work at our homestay, let me know.

452
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,000
We can discuss your salary.

453
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You can join the staff training.

454
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,900
I've made my decision. I'll join you.

455
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
Join what?

456
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,900
The renovation will take several months before the place will be open for business.

457
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,200
During this period of time, think carefully.

458
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,960
If you really want to work there, discuss it with your parents. Sell the store.

459
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
I know! I'm not a three-year-old!

460
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,100
- By the way, can I bring Yang Zhinan over?
- Nope.

461
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,700
He's very hardworking.

462
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,300
- I only want you or Yang Zhinan. Just one.
- Why?

463
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
Well, you know why.

464
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
If you two are together, it'll be endless quarrels every day.

465
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,100
Will any work be done?

466
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,300
That's true.

467
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,100
Besides, I don't know if we'll still be a couple then.

468
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,200
Let me tell you this.

469
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,300
He lied to me last time about heading home to sleep.

470
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Turns out he went to an internet cafe and played games all night.

471
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,000
That's preposterous! Break up right away!

472
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,600
Why are you like that?

473
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Why don't you break up with Sister Hongdou?

474
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,300
We don't quarrel. I don't lie to her.

475
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,499
Sister Hongdou, let me tell you this.

476
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
When Uncle A'Yao was swimming in the reservoir as a kid, his clothes were stolen.

477
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
He went home naked.

478
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,000
That was Yang Guanjun.

479
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yang Guanjun?

480
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Who's the one who enjoys drinking glycerine enema

481
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,000
and chewing table corners in class until a quarter of the table was gone?

482
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,200
Was that you?

483
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,500
That was Xie Qiang.

484
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Xie Qiang?

485
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,700
Xiao Qin, don't fret. Take your time to consider.

486
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,900
Think about all the embarrassing things Chairman Xie has done.

487
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,800
I have plenty of time.

488
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
<i>Hu Youyu.</i>

489
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,300
Come in.

490
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,600
Sister, why did you call me by my full name?

491
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,000
What are you frying?

492
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,900
It smells good.

493
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
Aunty A'Gui taught me this. Fried mushrooms.

494
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I plan to make a few cans and send them to my daughter's school.

495
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
For your daughter?

496
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,900
That's nice.

497
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,300
You've been avoiding me for days.

498
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm not avoiding you. I'm busy.

499
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,600
It's okay. I can understand.

500
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,700
You think it's awkward.

501
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
That incident...

502
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,700
How do I put this?

503
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,200
I... I was really drunk that day.

504
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I was a little impulsive,

505
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,800
but I...I never thought about that before.

506
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,799
You're so gorgeous. Right?

507
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,100
I dared not think about such things.

508
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,600
Besides, we live in the same courtyard.

509
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,500
W-We got along pretty well.

510
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,100
After that happened...

511
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Xiao Yu,

512
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I'm pretty fond of you.

513
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,200
You're talented

514
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
and kind to those around you.

515
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You're also very adorable.

516
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,500
You appeared when I needed consolation the most.

517
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,200
You brought a lot of positivity and novelty into my life.

518
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,000
When I'm with you, I forget much of my unhappiness.

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,200
You were drunk that day

520
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,000
and brought gifts to please me.

521
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,800
That really made my heart race.

522
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But that's all.

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,900
There can't be more between us.

524
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
What do you mean?

525
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,700
I mean,

526
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I don't want a long-term relationship with you.

527
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,500
Hold on. I... I don't get it.

528
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,000
If you don't want a lasting relationship with me,

529
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
why...

530
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,000
why did you do that?

531
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,680
I'm single. You're single, too.

532
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,400
Both of us, under that circumstance,

533
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,300
shared a mutual feeling.

534
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,300
We were willing parties, so that happened.

535
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,600
Forget it.

536
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,299
The coffee beans are in the storage room.

537
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,200
Under the counter, there are common cleaning products.

538
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
Some of them are in the storage room.

539
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,400
You should remember to take stock every month and replenish them.

540
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,600
- And—
- Sister Na Na, you're just leaving for a short time.

541
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
It's not like you won't come back.

542
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,000
There's no need to explain in such detail.

543
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,700
Did you remember everything?

544
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,800
Yes, I have.

545
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,300
By the way, there's this as well.

546
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,400
Here is the list of things to note and storage areas.

547
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,400
If you don't remember where things are, you can check this.

548
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
- I'll put it here.
- Okay.

549
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,600
All right, let's get back to work.

550
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,559
Sister Na Na, a handsome guy over there has been staring at you.

551
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,780
Has he fallen in love with you?

552
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Hurry up and work.

553
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,199
Hello. Yes, this is Youfeng Cafe

554
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,560
Nana-chan?

555
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,520
Are you looking for Na Na? Just a moment.

556
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,079
Sister Na Na, your call.

557
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,000
- Who is it?
- I don't know. They're looking for you.

558
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,720
Hello. Who is this?

559
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,919
It'll be great to have another crowd like last week.

560
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,360
It was so bustling!

561
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,300
In the evening, there was still a queue at my barbecue stand.

562
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,560
Aren't you tired?

563
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,080
How could making money be tiring?

564
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,780
Mr. Dizzy next door has even ordered wholesale bubble machines.

565
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,440
What bubble machines?

566
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,320
Those things.

567
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,120
The ones that can spray soap bubbles automatically.

568
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,060
Oh, I know. The children toy, right?

569
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,960
Yeah.

570
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,020
The villagers all want to start a small business at their doors. Everyone's starting to sell things.

571
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,160
- That's good.
- Yes.

572
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,500
Wait, someone's calling me.

573
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,320
<i>[Unknown number]</i>

574
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,720
Hello, who is it?

575
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,380
Yes, I'm the manager.

576
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,760
What?

577
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,600
Who's singing?

578
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,039
Watch your words. Have you gotten the wrong number?

579
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,000
Wait. Hold on. How did you get my phone number?

580
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,470
Make yourself clear. Don't hang up!

581
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,320
Hello?

582
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,740
- Lunatic.
- What's going on?

583
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,140
He said our cafe has a female live streamer who stole donations.

584
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,220
He wants me to fire her and gave me a scolding.

585
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,620
Ridiculous.

586
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
It must be a scam call.

587
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,160
Who knows?

588
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,080
Download the National Anti-Fraud application.

589
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,360
I already did. Look.

590
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
<i>[Unknown Number]</i>
Here we go again. Don't answer it.

591
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,659
Sister, take care.

592
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,520
A'Yao, remember to ask for my help again.

593
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,180
No problem.

594
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,840
Deliver the wages to these few people.

595
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,320
They can't come over for some reason.

596
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,300
Okay, I'll deliver them.

597
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,400
I won't be a third wheel here.

598
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,020
My mom said that those who ruin good things have ill heels.

599
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,180
- I'll kick you.
- Bye-bye!

600
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,360
Darned brat.

601
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
Tired?

602
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,220
My neck and lower back are a little sore.

603
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,840
Come on. I'll give you a massage.

604
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
Is this amount of force all right, President Xu?

605
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,820
Not bad.

606
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,820
These few days have been a battlefield.

607
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,680
You must be tired.

608
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Corporate events and festivals

609
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,020
at the hotel were like a battlefield as well.

610
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,680
No wonder everyone loves traffic.

611
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,340
A blogger posts a video, and we'd have a tourist boom.

612
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,419
Before that, it was so deserted.

613
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,160
We were worried.

614
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,840
Now that people swarm here, it's too much for us to handle.

615
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,839
I read the reviews.

616
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:06,340
The good ones say we're enthusiastic,

617
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,320
the scenery is beautiful,

618
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,820
and the food is delicious without being expensive.

619
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,859
The bad ones say that this place was crowded.

620
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,140
They complain about long queues and find the place boring.

621
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,359
They say the town lacks interesting spots, there are few stores, and the such.

622
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,880
In the future, the number of shops in town will increase.

623
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
It's bound to get better.

624
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,740
Have you chosen sanitary ware for the place?

625
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,880
Yes. I'm planning to use high-end and known brands.

626
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,319
If you start like this, you'll exceed your budget.

627
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:51,199
I've considered all these.

628
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,580
Let me tell you this. I reviewed some other high-end homestays.

629
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,379
Most of the complaints are about the bathrooms.

630
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,100
For example, the toilet bowl is clogged,

631
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,600
the sewer stinks,

632
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,480
the shower head doesn't work well,

633
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,020
or the water temperature isn't consistent.

634
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,800
So, I decided to deal with this as best as I can.

635
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,919
The brand of sanitary wares must be the best.

636
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,559
That'll save us subsequent maintenance costs.

637
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,680
We can also improve the brand experience greatly.

638
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,410
Don't you agree?

639
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,980
The bedding and mattresses must be of good quality as well.

640
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,480
Stuff like bath towels and face towels should also be the best.

641
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,700
All these are key points to improve customer experience.

642
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,760
For toiletries, I'm planning to use a domestic brand.

643
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,320
I found a good one.

644
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
What about the furniture?

645
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,699
The furniture?

646
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,140
The same style using different types of wood makes a huge difference.

647
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,260
Let me tell you this. Cherrywood and beechwood are cheap.

648
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,979
Walnut and teak are expensive.

649
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,460
Do you know? The price can be several times higher.

650
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,299
So, for the wood, we can use something a little cheaper.

651
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,680
However, the texture can't be affected.

652
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,139
You're very thorough. Very all-encompassing.

653
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:07,619
The best resources should be channeled wisely.

654
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,420
Some money can be saved, but some shouldn't be. Don't you think so?

655
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,559
Think about this. Guests who visit high-end homestays are bound to be particular.

656
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,620
The details will make or break us.

657
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,140
I thought I was your senior in entrepreneurship.

658
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
I'm supposed to teach you many things.

659
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,500
Seems like you don't need my help at all.

660
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,860
That's not true. This is just the beginning.

661
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm sure I'll need your help with many problems to come. Please don't find me annoying.

662
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,419
Annoying? I'm worried you don't even need me.

663
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,760
The construction team you found is excellent.

664
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,860
The foreman is very responsible as well.

665
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,980
Would I find someone bad for you?

666
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,280
Come here. I'll give you a massage.

667
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,699
I'm fine. Don't worry. Come on.

668
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,520
Okay.

669

Hello, Damai.

676
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,000
Na Na is at work.

677
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,840
What's the matter?

678
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,660
What? I don't quite understand what you mean.

679
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,959
Na Na, are you done packing?

680
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,780
Hongdou, I'll be done soon.

681

682
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,960
I'll head over later.

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,900
How long is your trip?

684
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,480
I haven't been home for a long time.

685
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,399
In that case, will you be coming back?

686
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,800
Once you leave this time, where are you going?
