00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,400
<i>Hello, the phone you dialed has been turned off.</i>

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Come on, cheers!

5
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,100
<i>Cheers!</i>

6
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,900
A'Yuan, these are my best buddies.

7
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,100
I'm introducing them to you.

8
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,600
From now you, they're your friends too.

9
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,800
Isn't that great?

10
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
This is my little brother, A'Yuan, Xie Zhiyuan.

11
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
Hang out with him in the future.

12
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Hi, A'Yuan.

13
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello.

14
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,440
A'Yuan. Yuan, do you know how to play 15-20?

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
No, I don't.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't know?

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,100
You guys can go ahead.

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
Okay, sure.

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll play with whoever loses.

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,900
Why do you look so down?

21
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Have some drinks.

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,600
My brother said I can only drink alcohol after I turn 18.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,700
Kiddo, are you still letting your brother decide everything?

24
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,400
As a man, you have to be independent and stand your ground.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,900
Got it?

26
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,200
Independence.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
How am I supposed to be independent?

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Well...

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200
That means you're financially independent.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
Don't you hate your brother's overbearingness?

31
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,800
That's because you aren't earning your own money. You have nothing to you.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Once you start making money, you'll have the confidence to do as you please.

33
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,400
You can be assertive.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Assertive?

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes. I have to be assertive.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
I think my brother's right.

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Can you drink coconut milk?

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Of course.

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,500
Madam, a bottle of coconut milk, please.

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,800
<i>Okay!</i>

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
Anyway, look on the bright side.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,800
Right now, you're free.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Enjoy this sense of freedom.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
Come on, finish your drinks.

45
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
Come on.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Why did you run away from home?

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,200
I shot to fame in my hometown.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Pay me ¥75 each.

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't need to pay. It's my treat.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,100
- No, I have to. It's just enough.
- There's really no need.

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Take it.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Let's call it a day and gather some other time.

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay. Bye-bye.

55
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,000
Bye-bye, kiddo.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Bye-bye.

57
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
What's wrong?

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,600
Feeling homesick?

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
That's normal when you first leave home.

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,100
Keep this in mind. Be independent.

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's go.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,300
Be independent.

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,800
I have to be independent. I need to get a job and make money.

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to piss Xie Zhiyao off.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
- Piss Xie Zhiyao off.
- Exactly.

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
He kicked my butt. He didn't give a damn about me.

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
He ignored me. I'll kill him with worry.

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,900
- Kill him with worry.
- Yes, kill him with worry.

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Brother, I've made my decision.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,500
From today on, I'll become a proper working adult.

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,100
- Follow me and you can be a proper working adult.
- Okay.

72
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,000
First, let me teach you how to say "welcome".

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
- You have to be passionate.
- Passionate.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
It might not matter to the customers,

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
but the boss will see how enthusiastic you are.

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
- He'll be happy to see that.
- Happy?

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,100
- That's right.
- Brother, how should I say it?

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,200
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
You have to channel your breath into it.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Welcome!

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Y-You have to pay attention to the rhythm.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Welcome!

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,800
Be enthusiastic and brave!

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,500
♪ <i>Be brave</i> ♪

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
Have you found A'Yuan?

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,100
Nope. He ran away from home and took his bag with him.

90
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,400
He even brought a change of clothes.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I really didn't say a word.

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
That's not important right now.

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,300
Wait. This is extremely important.

94
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
I didn't expose him.

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,500
I swear. I've never even talked in my sleep.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
If you say so.

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
What do you mean by that?

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I did not.

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, fine.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Saying okay means you believe me, but "Okay, fine" means you doubt me

101
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,000
and you're just placating me.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,300
Calm down. I wasn't implying anything.

103
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Wait! Both of you can't wrong me like this.

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,800
The point is that we're the only two who know in this village.

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
We're the only two who know in this village.

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,800
I didn't say it. Well, perhaps you said it.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm cool with you interrupting my speech,

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,400
but why are you accusing me when I didn't even doubt you? Of course, I didn't say a word.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
If we're the only possible culprits,

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
it's certainly not me.

111
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
It's not me either.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
- This doesn't matter.
- This is very important.

113
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Locating your brother is top priority now.

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,700
Why are you laughing?

115
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
You're so kind.

116
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Weirdo.

117
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I sent Guobao to the kindergarten

118
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
and ran into him at the mouth of the alley.

119
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I just teased him

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
and asked him if he was skipping school because he crapped his pants.

121
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
He dashed off immediately.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Me... Me too.

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
He called me today and asked for Hongdou's number.

124
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I asked him as a joke.

125
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Well, who did you hear it from?

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
From my mom.

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
All the ladies in the warehouse know about this.

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,800
I guess Aunty E heard it from them, too.

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
So, we can't find out who started it.

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Why are you looking into that? This doesn't matter.

131
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
It matters.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,100
Neither of us uttered a word.

133
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,600
How the heck did word get out?

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,700
Why are you invested in how it spread?

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
Look for A'Yuan first.

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
You're to blame.

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
A joke?

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How can you make a joke about this?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
He's just a child.

140
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,500
At the age of 16 or 17, that's when a person's self-esteem is everything.

141
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
No matter how young a person is,

142
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
you can't make a joke about someone's humiliation.

143
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
You guys don't know a thing.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
When Yang Guanjun was in junior high school, he went swimming in the reservoir.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
His classmates hid his clothes.

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,100
When it was dark, he came back to the village butt-naked.

147
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,600
The ladies in the village thought he was a pervert and almost beat him up.

148
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
It's all in the past! Why are you dragging it out now?

149
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I was just making a joke.

150
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Well... Brother.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Do you think A'Yuan went back to Kunming?

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,700
He came here from Kunming because of this incident. Why would he go back?

153
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,000
Did you ask Uncle Siping?

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,400
I did.

155
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
You don't look the slightest bit anxious.

156
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,600
Why would I be anxious?

157
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
He's all grown up and has money with him.

158
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
I may as well leave him be.

159
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,900
When he runs out of money, he'll come back himself.

160
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,000
You sure are taking this in your stride.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
What if he steals and robs when he's out of money?

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,700
The law can punish him, then.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
Xie Xiaoxia.

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,400
You're best buddies with him.

165
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
Didn't he tell you where he went?

166
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,700
Nope.

167
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,400
He told you to say that, didn't he?

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
No, Brother. I really don't know.

169
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,000
It's so much trouble to raise a child.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,700
Why are these four children behaving so well today?

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Take another bite.

172
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
These can't be bought from around here.

173
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Come on.

174
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Did he say something? What did he say?

175
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
He said he bought two tangerines

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
but they didn't taste sweet.

177
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
<i>[Office]</i>
We sell tons of tangerines.

178
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
We can't possibly peel everything to taste if they're sweet.

179
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,300
Exactly.

180
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,000
In older times, only the emperor in the palace

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
received such treatment.

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,800
The maids would always taste anything he ate first to test for poison.

183
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
So, the emperor ate leftovers from the maids?

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
Now that you say so, that sounds about right.

185
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
It's spoiled.

186
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Chuchu.

187
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Come and have a look.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Check if these tangerines were from us. He said three of them were spoiled.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
How can she tell?

190
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
I can't really tell.

191
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Aunty A'Gui, are you hanging out here again?

192
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I came to chat with Aunty Feng.

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
We're working now.

194
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
I won't disrupt her work.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Manager, come and look at this.

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Chuchu.

197
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,800
He says three of the tangerines are spoiled.

198
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Were these bought from us?

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Aren't these oranges?

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
I thought so, too.

201
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,700
But he's asking for compensation.

202
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,600
- Compensate him.
- No way.

203
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,700
Aunty Feng, just let this go.

204
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,900
We'll compensate all cases that are hard to discern.

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,300
But this is way out of line. Utterly unreasonable.

206
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
Aunty Feng, listen to me.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
If you tell him that, he'll give us a bad review.

208
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
That'll harm our business.

209
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Got it?

210
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,700
Fine.

211
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Don't worry.

212
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Manager, have you found A'Yuan?

213
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
Not yet.

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
It's been days.

215
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,500
Chairman Xie says he has money with him.

216
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
So, there's no need to worry.

217
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,000
A'Yao is wrong about this.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Why isn't he looking for his brother?

219
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Children at that age can't tell good from bad.

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
If he hangs out with hooligans,

221
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
his life will be over.

222
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
They'll start with petty theft,

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
and then end up robbing others.

224
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,200
- No way.
- Why not?

225
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,400
He should've been spanked the moment he skipped school.

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Look at him now.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,500
His dad can't bear to hit him and sent him back to his hometown.

228
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,800
Now, his brother just lets him do as he pleases.

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
I just think we should find him first.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,600
If he still doesn't behave, break his legs.

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Let's see if he'll still rebel then.

232
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,400
All right, fine.

233
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,600
Aunty A'Gui. Can... Can you help us with the yams?

234
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm here to hang out, not to work.

235
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You're experienced. Come on, put on the gloves.

236
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
Okay, fine.

237
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,800
Hello. I've been waiting a long time for my porcino pancakes.

238
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm sorry, we're a little crowded today. Please wait a minute.

239
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
All right, please hurry up.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,300
Okay.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Let me help you. Which table is it?

242
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
The innermost tearoom.

243
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,400
Thank you.

244
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Na Na.

245
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,900
Chairman Xie.

246
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Why is Xu Hongdou serving food?

247
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,500
She came over to have a drink. She offered to help because I'm busy.

248
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
Are these the new books we ordered?

249
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes. It's too heavy. I'm worried that you can't carry them,

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,200
so I brought them over.

251
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,800
I'll put them in the storage room first. Remember to unpack them.

252
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
Great.

another latte and porcini pancake for Table 2.

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,300
- Do you have freebies?
- Freebies?

259
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,600
The guests at that table have been waiting for a long time.

260
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
They've already finished two glasses of water.

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you have any snacks to offer them?

262
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,400
- I have some nuts and Mahjong cookies.

push the round button here, and choose "juice".

Not yet. It's only been a few days.

Don't worry.

Is serving food part of a lobby manager's job?

293
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,800
A lobby manager's job is to provide good service.

294
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
I have to learn to do everything.

295
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,700
I thought you just needed to supervise your subordinates.

296
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,800
I need to manage everything.

297
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
You're pretty good with that.

298
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm done here. You can get on with your work. I'll get going.

299
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
Chairman Xie, the light bulbs.

300
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,100
<i>Got it!</i>

301
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,600
Let me do it.

302
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
- I'll serve this first.
- Okay.

303
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much today.

304
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,800
This is one of our drinks, Encounter.

305
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,200
Have a taste.

306
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a cold drink?

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,900
It's gorgeous.

308
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
Dark red roses taste completely different when cold brewed

309
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,700
and brewed with boiling water.

310
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,000
What a refreshing taste of roses.

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,900
Right? I think it's the taste of taking things slow.

312
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,800
Taking things slow?

313
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,600
The taste of taking things slow. That's because an important ingredient is time.

314
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,300
Right now, many things are losing the ability to progress slowly.

315
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,000
Everything is speeding up.

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
Even people are treated as machines.

317
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,100
That's right.

318
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,200
I always described our hotel as a giant clock.

319
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
The employees are cogs within it.

320
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,000
We're pressed for time and racing against time.

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,400
In a competition against time,

322
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
humans will always lose.

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000

<i>Hongdou, what do you think we'll look like when we grow old?</i>

328
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,100
♫ <i>The light and shadows of the seasons</i> ♫

329
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,800
♫ <i> I've seen the meteor that lights up the night sky</i> ♫

330
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:00,000
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

331
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
♫ <i>I'll head to a windy place to meet you</i> ♫

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
- Brother A'Yao.
- Yang Xu.

333
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Has your brother come home?

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Nope.

335
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Why don't you go find him?

336
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,900
There's no need for that. He'll come back when he's bored.

337
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Children at that age aren't sensible.

338
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,400
How's your business?

339
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,200
There are more drivers than tourists. We've got too few customers.

340
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,900
I'm planning to quit, take out a loan, and buy a car.

341
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,600
Buy a car?

342
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
My cousin and his family are living in Kunming. I've asked him about it.

343
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,800
With a car, I'll work as a driver there, and my wife can do housekeeping.

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,500
When we've earned some money, we'll find a school and bring our child over.

345
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,200
Doesn't that mean Tuotuo has to live with his grandparents?

346
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
Yeah. There's nothing we can do.

347
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,600
We can't make any money.

348
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
Things will get better.

349
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,400
The government is developing the tourism industry—

350
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,700
Who knows what will happen?

351
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,200
We'll come back when things get better.

352
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Right now, the family needs to be fed.

353
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Tuotuo's going to attend elementary school soon.

354
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,700
We can't always live off our farmland.

355
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,200
I'll go look for customers.

356
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Xiao Qin.

357
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Get me two light bulbs. 12 watts, yellow light.

358
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,000
Gotcha.

359
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,200
I heard that A'Yuan is playing truant because he had a stomach ache

360
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,500
and pooped on his teacher's pants.

361
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,200
How did he do that?

362
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Who did you hear that from?

363
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
My mom.

364
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,500
She heard it from someone else.

365
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,600
Someone even said that he pooped at the school gates. I don't buy that.

366
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
So, you believe that he pooped on his teacher's pants?

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Well, who did he poop on?

368
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,500
He's the one with the stomach ache. What do you think?

369
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't know. I asked you on WeChat, but you ignored my message.

370
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Here you go.

371
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,900
Tell me first. Who did he poop on?

372
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
Give it to me.

373
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,400
I want to have dinner at your place tonight.

374
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Your braised beef with wine is delicious.

375
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,700
Your dad came to see me yesterday and talked about you.

376
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
Did he offer my hand in marriage?

377
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
He wants me to persuade you to become an apprentice at the embroidery workshop.

378
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm not going. Even you can't convince me to go.

379
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
Tell him to give up.

380
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,580
Your dad just wants you to learn a trade.

381
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,340
When I was a child, I watched my granny embroider all day long.

382
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,940
A piece of clothing took her six months.

383
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,600
Now that she's old, her back is hunched and she's going blind.

384
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,839
Each piece barely brings in any money.

385
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,220
I'm not going there.

386
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,079
- You—
- Two light bulbs for ¥40. Payment through WeChat, right?

387
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,820
I won't profit off you.

388
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,280
Okay, give it a try.

389
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,060
Sorry, I came over to change it so late in the night.

390
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,220
It's fine. I haven't started cooking yet.

391
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,539
- Where else needs to be fixed?
- Oh, the terrace.

392
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,800
It's been down for days. Na Na is waiting for you upstairs.

393
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,719
- Okay, I'll go check it.
- Thank you.

394
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,340
You're welcome.

395
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,799
I bought tomatoes.

396
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,800
Let's have egg noodles with tomato omelette tonight.

397
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,000
It's easy to cook.

398
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,700
Hongdou, what are you looking at?

399
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,320
Hasn't Chairman Xie gone to look for his brother at all?

400
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,380
He probably doesn't know where to start looking.

401
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,660
I don't think he cares either.

402
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,739
Perhaps he really isn't worried.

403
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,820
Na Na told me that Chairman Xie and his brother don't share the same mother.

404
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,820
When Chairman Xie was very young,

405
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,840
his parents left him here and went to work in Kunming.

406
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,760
His mother passed away due to illness.

407
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,079
After a few years, his dad remarried and had his brother.

408
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,360
They've never lived together.

409
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,100
People need to spend time together to forge a bond.

410
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,140
<i>Deqing is like an old peacock.</i>

411
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,179
He's always putting his feathers on display wherever he goes.

412
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,140
He's been like this since he was younger.

413
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Hongdou!

414
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,360
Is A'Yao with you?

415
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,600
A'Yao's changing the light bulbs.

416
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,700
A'Yao.

417
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,360
Come down. We need to talk to you.

418
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,340
<i>Wait for me to change the light bulb. I won't take long.</i>

419
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,100
Let's wait for him to finish.

420
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,499
Hongdou, let me introduce Aunty Feng to you.

421
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,300
Aunty Feng.

422
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,139
Come on, let's wait for him.

423
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,620
Have a seat. I'll make you some tea.

424
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,499
There's no need. I'm not thirsty.

425
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,640
So what if you aren't? I'm thirsty.

426
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,219
- Thanks, Hongdou.
- You're welcome.

427
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:37,319
How can A'Yao be in the mood to be changing light bulbs?

428
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,200
Stop being so impatient. You're like a cockerel about to explode.

429
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,179
Why are Aunty Baoping and the rest here?

430
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,720
I don't know. They said they need to talk to Chairman Xie.

431
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
Are these shared cups?

432
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Mr. Ma bought this for us to drink.

433
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,280
Use it to make tea.

434
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,500
Aunty Feng looks really stern.

435
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,400
Who is she?

436
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,960
She works in Chairman Xie's web store with Aunty Baoping.

437
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,560
Aunty Baoping is responsible for deliveries.

438
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,520
Aunty Feng is in charge of customer service.

439
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,100
Chiarman Xie's web store?

440
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,200
Isn't that Xiaochun's shop?

441
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,320
Chairman Xie hired Xiaochun as a manager.

442
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,160
So, Xiaochun only owns the cafe.

443
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,119
Didn't I say that Xiaochun is just a manager?

444
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,380
Everyone calls him Chairman Xie.

445
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,779
Even you do so sometimes.

446
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,239
That's because he's the owner of the horse ranch.

447
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,520
He owns the horse ranch.

448
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,660
He also owns the embroidery workshop, the tie-dye workshop, and this courtyard.

449
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,380
You're cooped up indoors all day. Why do you know so much?

450
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,080
When I'm cooking, Na Na always tells me about the village's gossip.

451
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,700
There's gossip here?

452
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,560
Tons of it.

453
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,280
Gossip...

454
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,720
- Have some fruit.
- Hongdou.

455
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,100
- There's fruit?
- Hongdou, sit here.

456
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,820
- Sit over here.
- Thank you.

457
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,459
I don't believe she's already 30.

458
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,180
I am. I'm two years older than Xiaochun.

459
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,659
You look too young to be 30.

460
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,339
When we were young,

461
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,700
we had to pick mushrooms on Cang Mountain and fish in Erhai Lake.

462
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,319
We braved the sun and rain without applying any cream.

463
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,339
So, we all look old.

464
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,039
Xiao Xi is different.

465
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,039
She's also 30, but her skin is so tender.

466
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
You look just like her.

467
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,439
What was that?

468
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,200
What about that?

469
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,640
You humphed when I said Hongdou looks like Xiao Xi.

470
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,379
What's wrong with Xiao Xi?

471
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,540
- Xiao Xi is great.
- Of course.

472
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,920
Look at her hand.

473
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,559
So delicate.

474
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,900
I'm sure she hasn't done any physical labor.

475
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,840
How nice.

476
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
Her fingers are so aligned.

477
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,060
That means wealth will stay with you.

478
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,019
Baoping is amazing at palm reading.

479
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,220
She studied Dayang's palm

480
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,639
and said he'll be the top scholar.

481
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:01,060
Sure enough, he's doing well in life.

482
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,260
What else?

483
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,900
Your love line is promising, too.

484
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,680
That's good.

485
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,460
She's clearly a blessed girl.

486
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,579
You only say nice things.

487
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,160
What else is she supposed to say?

488
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,480
Show your hand to Baoping.

489
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,899
What for?

490
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,060
In this day and age, I don't believe such things.

491
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,099
- I'm coming.
- Come and have seat.

492
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,300
Hold on.

493
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,680
What's so urgent? Isn't a call more convenient?

494
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,200
We have to say it to your face.

495
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Don't find us annoying.

496
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
We have to lay things out today.

497
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,060
-You guys can chat. I'll...
- Hongdou, sit down.

498
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,080
Sit down. We're going to talk about A'Yuan.

499
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,859
You should stay and listen.

500
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,940
Have some strawberries.

501
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,080
Everyone has been asking me about this lately.

502
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,200
My throat is parched from explaining.

503
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
He's a grown man. What could possibly happen to him?

504
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,460
I know what I'm doing, all right?

505
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,400
Like hell you do.

506
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,819
A'Yuan is still a child.

507
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,980
He doesn't know he's in danger, and we don't know what he's doing.

508
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,620
He's been away for ages, but you aren't even searching for him.

509
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,539
He probably doesn't know where to start looking.

510
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,320
Even if he's at a loss, he should try searching.

511
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,760
If he doesn't even try, do you know what the villagers will say?

512
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,860
"They don't even share the same mother anyway."

513
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,219
"A'Yao just doesn't care."

514
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,660
Just ignore their nonsense.

515
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,540
We can ignore their nonsense,

516
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,280
but we can't keep their mouths shut.

517
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,680
They're free to say whatever they want.

518
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,699
You have to look for him, and call the police if you're desperate.

519
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,640
Tie him up and drag him to Kunming if you have to.

520
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,080
This child sure is a handful.

521
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,339
It's just feeling embarrassed after crapping his pants.

522
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,080
Why is he making such a big deal of it and quitting school?

523
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,479
You can't say that.

524
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,359
He's at an age where his self-esteem is important.

525
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,819
He thinks this is a grave matter.

526
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,200
Regardless, he can't quit school just because of this.

527
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,459
That's not the point.

528
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,040
We can't even find him.

529
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,000
Goodness, you should really spank him when he's back.

530
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,920
Granny doesn't let me spank him.

531
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,080
Granny doesn't let you?

532
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,900
She's biased to him.

533
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,579
That's true. She's too old.

534
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:12,059
A'Yuan is also the youngest.

535
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,320
He can't be spanked.

536
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,939
How did we get carried away?

537
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,000
You still have to look for him.

538
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,380
I didn't say I wouldn't look for him.

539
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,760
Just leave this to me and spare yourself the anxiety.

540
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,380
Even if you aren't worried, we can't be at ease.

541
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,280
It's enough that he understands.

542
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,640
Have some fruit.

543
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,360
Who knows where A'Yuan went?

544
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,659
Aunties, be careful on your way back. Watch your step!

545
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,840
Well, I have to speak to A'Yao about work.

546
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,640
- You guys can go back first.
- Okay.

547
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,580
We won't wait up. Bye.

548
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
- Be careful.
- Okay.

549
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,180
Aunty Feng, what's the matter with work?

550
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,720
Actually, it's not really about work.

551
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,560
A'Yao, do you still remember this?

552
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,679
When you were around 15 years old,

553
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,240
you stole bird eggs with A'Qiang and Guanjun.

554
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,779
You just came back and were about to cook them.

555
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,120
Didn't the State Forestry Bureau come over with the police?

556
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,579
That was under state protection.

557
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,339
Look at you. How can you laugh?

558
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,740
You were clueless about the law.

559
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,860
Look how severe that ended up.

560
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,619
I get it. Go on.

561
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,800
Well, A'Yuan is at the same age as you back then.

562
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,199
Exactly the same age.

563
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,419
He doesn't know about the law, and he's mischievous.

564
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,779
He's rebellious.

565
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,139
If you don't discipline him and spoil him,

566
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,300
he'll get into deep trouble easily.

567
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,000
Got it?

568
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,420
Aunty Feng, I'll be honest with you,

569
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,900
but you can't tell the rest.

570
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,380
Okay.

571
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,360
- Welcome!
- Be careful.

572
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,180
Please come again!

573
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,860
Your dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

574
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,080
Okay, thank you.

575
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,960
Waiter, a plate of matsutake dumplings, please.

576
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,679
Okay. Madam.

577
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,260
Table 3 wants a plate of matsutake dumplings.

578
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,700
Got it.

579
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,520
- Clear the tables. We're out of cutlery.
- Okay.

580
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,219
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

581
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,000
<i>[Brother Xia Xia]</i>

582
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,820
Hello, Brother Xia Xia.

583
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,740
I'm tired,

584
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,200
but I'm capable of everything they can do.

585
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,399
I know. I'm not so delicate.

586
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,040
Well, how is my family?

587
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,580
They're doing well.

588
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,259
Your granny goes to work daily, and your brother's busy.

589
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:09,710
You didn't tell my brother that you contacted me, did you?

590
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,730
I didn't. What do you think I am?

591
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:15,980
Did my brother look for me?

592
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,799
<i>He didn't. He doesn't know you're working part-time.</i>

593
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,460
<i>They think you'll come back once you're out of money.</i>

594
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,240
Well, they're wrong.

595
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,699
Just come back soon.

596
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,239
<i>I'm not going back.</i>

597
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,220
<i>I have to go to school if I go back.</i>

598
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,080
You should go to school.

599
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,440
Didn't your brother say he'd help you with a school transfer?

600
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,490
Why have you changed? Weren't you supportive of my plans?

601
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,720
I didn't know you skipped school because of diarrhea.

602
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,880
<i>I thought you were bad at studies.</i>

603
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,520
Forget it.

604
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,780
If you want to work, then go on.

605
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,340
Brother Xia Xia,

606
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,619
haven't you gone to Shanghai yet?

607
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,680
When are you going there?

608
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,460
Soon. What's up?

609
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,480
Can you take me with you?

610
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,200
Why do you want to go there?

611
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,520
I haven't been to Shanghai.

612
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,080
Drop that thought and focus on your job.

613
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,500
<i>Bye.</i>

614
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Who were you talking to?

615
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,180
Brother Xia Xia.

616
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,080
Xia Xia? What did he tell you?

617
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,520
You seem pretty down.

618
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,699
My brother didn't even look for me.

619
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,040
He doesn't even care about me.

620
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,320
Well, let them worry for a few more days.

621
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,380
Brother,

622
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,100
doesn't your family care that you're working?

623
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,700
They can't dictate my life.

624
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,520
Call us the moment you arrive in Shanghai.

625
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,779
When you see Brother Kaiwen, give him the cow's milk cheese.

626
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,520
If he doesn't know what to do with them, video call me and I'll teach him.

627
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,000
Nobody takes so much stuff onto the plane.

628
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,419
This isn't much.

629
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,640
Besides, you just need to put them on the plane. You don't need to carry them.

630
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,520
Someone will pick you up as soon as you get off the plane.

631
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,039
- Look at you.
- It's fine, I got it.

632
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,599
Keep this in mind. Don't cause trouble for others.

633
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,259
Treat him to a meal after he receives you.

634
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,780
I know. Can you stop babbling?

635
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,539
Do you think I enjoy nagging?

636
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,860
I'm teaching you about the ways of the world.

637
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,580
Aunty.

638
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,220
A'Hai, it's you. I thought your brother would come.

639
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,560
Someone chartered his car today.

640
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,660
The plane leaves at 12:15. Don't be late.

641
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,580
Rest assured.

642
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,360
Why did you put the chees like this?

643
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,160
- Put it properly.
- Okay.

644
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,099
Don't forget. Call me when you get to the airport and when you land.

645
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,699
Give me a call every day.
