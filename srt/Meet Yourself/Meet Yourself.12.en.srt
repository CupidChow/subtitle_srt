00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,600
<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Chairman Xie! Xiaochun!

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Speak of the devil.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,100
Were you talking about me? What exactly were you discussing?

6
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,800
We said you're bubbly and kind.

7
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
Come with me. I need to speak to you.

8
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,200
Why can't I be present?

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,300
Come on.

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you beaming with glee?

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I have great news!

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,600
Did you snag a rich man?

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Bingo.

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,100
However, it's up to us to secure that money.

15
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,200
Who is this wealthy guy?

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,500
You're so delighted.

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,800
Tell me more.

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Have you heard of Shaohua Bookstore?

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Yes.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
I've been to their flagship store in Beijing.

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,500
What are your thoughts about having one of their stores in Yunmiao Village?

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,800
What? That'll be amazing.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,450
Tell me the details.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm starving, and I'm craving the braised chicken from Galsang Flower Restaurant.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,300
Let's go and have a meal!

26
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
Shaohua Bookstore?

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,100
I've been there. There's a branch in Beijing.

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,400
I went there with my best friend.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
What's your impression of it?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
It's pretty huge, with two or three floors.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,200
It's also aesthetic and literary.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
The place has its unqiue charm.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,800
The coffee and desserts are tasty,

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,600
and they have a wide range of books and accessories.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
It's a nice place.

36
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,400
Would such a store in Yunmiao Village

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,600
pique your interest?

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
A store is opening on Mount Qingcheng,

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,200
and many travel bloggers are planning to visit the place.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,900
The homestays around Mount Qingcheng are fully booked.

42
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,000
Mount Qingcheng? What's their specialty?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Lady White Snake.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
Are they planning to sell snake soup in their cafe?

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Childish.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,600
The main dish hasn't even been served. Stop filling your stomach with fried milk.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
I like it.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
You'll fart if you have too much of it.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Bullshit.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
I don't quite understand your explanation.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
What's going on?

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
So, there'll be a bookstore in this place. Right?

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm good friends with a senior at school,

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,500
His postgraduate classmate is the founder.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,700
I asked him to introduce me to the founder.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400
Then, I told the founder about Yunmiao Village.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,700
He was really intrigued,

58
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
so he wants to check out this place.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,100
He wants to survey this place?

60
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, that's not a guaranteed deal.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
Don't say that.

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
My senior told me that guy won't make a trip personally

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
if he weren't drawn by this place.

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
He'd just send his assistant here.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
He has already taken the first step.

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
Shouldn't we help him go all the way?

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,600
That's why we have to make preparations.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll entertain him.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
Our dear investor can understand the geography,

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,300
environmental advantages, and the unique culture of Yunmiao Village.

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,800
Okay. I'll help with explaining the policy support

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
offered to investors for rural revitalization,

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,200
as well as some tax incentives.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,200
Hongdou. Help us with hosting him.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
I've never entertained bigwigs.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm used to bigwigs dealing with each other.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,500
It's important that you aren't a local here.

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,970
You're a tourist, so they'll think your opinion is objective.

79
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,600
Besides, we don't know how many people are coming. We need help.

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Come on.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,200
We can get Aunty Huailan to make us some clothes to welcome them in.

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,300
Sorry.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
What do you mean by "us"?

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,800
You're included.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,100
Listen up, Hongdou.

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,000
I saw Ms. Xie make formal attire for Gezi.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
It was tailored just for her and gorgeous!

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Even the collar was embroidered.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,900
It's the only one in the world, and you'll never have an identical wardrobe to someone else.

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,600
Exactly. They had to be in formal attire for the Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,500
We should hurry up and get those clothes made.

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,800
The preparations need to kick off.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
- Let's go after lunch.
- Okay.

94
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Sure.

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,700
Here's your braised chicken.

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Put it here.

97
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
Enjoy it.

98
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,600
Thank you, Aunty Hua.

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
You're welcome.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll dig in.

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,300
Are you keeping Ms. Huailan's works for an exhibition?

102
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,400
Veteran craftsmen like Mrs. Huailan

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
infuse life into their pieces.

104
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
They're all works of art.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
As a local craftsman,

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
she can surely open an exhibition.

107
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,000
What is Ms. Huailan's child doing?

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She hasn't gotten married yet.

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
Why not?

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,700
Ms. Xie went to the Old Town when she was 18

111
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,500
and met a Frenchman there.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,800
The Frenchman was a painter visiting China.

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
He fell in love with Ms. Xie at first sight,

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
and invited her to be the model for his art.

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
The painter painted countless portraits of Ms. Xie,

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
and Ms. Xie fell in love with him.

117
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,300
Why did they break up?

118
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
That painter wanted to go back to France.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
He told Ms. Xie,

120
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,200
"I love you. Come with me if you love me, too."

121
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
Then, Ms. Xie gave him a similar reply.

122
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,300
"I love you.

123
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,200
If you love me, stay here."

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
That Frenchman fell silent.

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,500
Ms. Xie said,

126
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,700
"If you can't do that, don't ask the same of me.

127
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
That's because love is equal."

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,300
If you want to prove you love me,

129
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,200
you need to sacrifice more for me.

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Exactly.

131
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,300
Ms. Xie didn't fall in love with anyone else.

132
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
So, she didn't get married.

133
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,800
But she has always been pursuing her passion.

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
She enjoys embroidery and teaching students.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,300
So, she's having the time of her life.

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Your ice cream is melting.

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Give it to me.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you have a tissue?

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Nope.

140
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,700
Give it to me.

141
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Just wipe your hand on my shirt.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll wash it later.

143
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I shouldn't have taken this path.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Yang Xu.

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Brother A'Yao.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Who is she?

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
She's my friend.

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,600
This is Tuotuo's dad.

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
Hello, Tuotuo's dad.

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Hello.

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,500
When are you leaving?

152
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,200
Soon.

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
My wife went over first to rent a place.

154
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Does Tuotuo know you aren't bringing him along this time?

155
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
We're hiding it from him for now.

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
He'll cry if we tell him.

157
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,800
He'll be upset again.

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
We can't do anything about it.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,700
- I'll leave you be. I'll invite you to dinner before I leave.
- Okay.

160
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,900
- I'm off. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

161
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,200
What's wrong?

162
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
It's nothing. Let's go.

163
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,200
Tuotuo, eat more.

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,700
You can't have this in Kunming.

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Kunming?

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Why is Tuotuo going to Kunming?

167
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
His parents are going there,

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
but Tuotuo doesn't want to leave.

169
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,900
He has no choice.

170
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Don't worry, Tuotuo.

171
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,200
Your parents won't take you with them.

172
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
You can stay at your grandparents' home and go to school.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
Uncle Guanjun, you're lying.

174
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm not.

175
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Your dad told me about this.

176
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
You'll go to school here like Huzi.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
The four of you will still be together.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Don't worry.

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Really, Dad?

180
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,800
Really?

181
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Yes.

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
What's wrong, Tuotuo?

183
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Why are you crying?

184
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
There, there. Don't cry.

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
What's wrong?

186
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
What's wrong, Tuotuo?

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,300
You get to stay together, don't you?

188
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,600
There, there. Don't cry.

189
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,100
What difference does an employee manual make?

190
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,200
There's a clear difference.

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
We can't be late or leave early.

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,500
If you aren't late, avoid leaving early, and don't ask for sudden leaves,

193
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
you'll receive a bonus of ¥200 every month.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Well, this employee manual should've been implemented ages ago.

195
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
That tenant is brilliant.

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,700
Don't just focus on the advantages Baoping is talking about.

197
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,800
They wouldn't have made this manual

198
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
just to give us more money.

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,000
They merely added an attendance bonus.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,900
Your salary will be deducted if you leave early.

201
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,200
If you fail to reach the assessment standards,

202
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
your salary will also be deducted, so be careful.

203
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Xiaochun said the major corporations in the cities all have this.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Well, is this manual a plus or a minus?

205
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
It doesn't really matter.

206
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
We just need to produce good work.

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,300
Is Xu Hongdou working in the cafe?

208
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Xiaochun said she's a volunteer.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,500
All the tenats of that courtyard are capable folks.

210
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
They got bored of city life,

211
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,300
so they came here to unwind.

212
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,700
Even Na Na won't stay here for long.

213
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900
All the youngsters in the village leave for the cities.

214
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,000
By the way, Yang Xu and his wife are also leaving.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They didn't tell their child.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Last night, Tuotuo found out the truth.

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
He threw a huge tantrum.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,200
It's the same for Huzi.

219
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
When his parents returned for the new year,

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,000
he couldn't even recognize them.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
That's not entirely true.

222
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Chairman Xie and Xiaochun are also capable folks,

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
but they came back.

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,700
We also have Huang Xinxin.

225
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,300
She became a village officer here after graduation.

226
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,400
She's so busy with development.

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
According to her, once the village is well-developed,

228
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
people and prosperity will come back.

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
It's a nice ideal,

230
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
but it's hard to tell whether we'll succeed.

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
This is the first step in conquering the Great Wall.

232
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
But it's possible to conquer the Great Wall.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Let's see if you can finish walking the entire Great Wall at my age.

234
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Don't discourage them.

235
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Youngsters need someone to tell them the brutal truth.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Life isn't a bed of roses.

237
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Aunty Baoping,

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
did Xiaochun tell you about Chairman Xie and Xu Hongdou?

239
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
What's going on?

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah. What happened?

241
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,300
My granny told me!

242
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,200
Chairman Xie agrees with everything she says.

243
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
No way.

244
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,700
He even treats her to meals at the restaurant all the time.

245
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,200
Restaurant meals must be expensive.

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Exactly.

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,400
He must be fond of her if he's spending money on her.

248
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
My dad said he'll just come back with Aunty.

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
A'Yuan won't come over.

250
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
He has too much unfinished homework,

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
so he needs to study.

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
Granny, are you listening to me?

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
What's on your mind?

254
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,400
A'Yao, tell me the truth.

255
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
You asked Xu Hongdou to help me with my stall

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and invited her home for a meal.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,900
Did you fall in love with her?

258
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
She thinks you look like her grandma.

259
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
So, she likes being with you.

260
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,700
Besides, I also invited Na Na and the rest over for a meal.

261
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Na Na came with Xiaochun,

262
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
and she only came twice.

263
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,000
You barely chatted with her.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
You treat Xu Hongdou differently.

265
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,600
You even bought her rice noodles.

266
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
That's our agreement for her voluntary work. I'll cover her meals.

267
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
He'll cover your meals?

268
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, why doesn't he just give you a meal allowance?

269
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't lack the money for meals.

270
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,500
Of course, he should buy delicious food for me.

271
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, why did he just take you to see the birth of the foal?

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
The birth of the foal?

273
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
I have to let her experience something she can't find in the city.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
I saw her playing with the cats in the courtyard

275
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,200
and guessed she likes animals.

276
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
When you look at her,

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,100
you're grinning up to your eyes.

278
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,900
He smiles at everyone.

279
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,300
He's extraordinarily pleased when he sees you.

280
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm a volunteer.

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,900
If I were him, I'd be grinning wider than he would.

282
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Must a male and a female always be a couple?

283
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm not here to find a boyfriend.

284
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Don't let your imagination run wild.

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,500
It's nothing.

286
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
We aren't like that.

287
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,300
I just think she's nice and kind,

288
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,199
but she'll leave soon.

289
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Don't jump to conclusions.

290
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm fond of her.

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
You can be fond of her, but don't implicate me.

292
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
You seem pretty fond of her, too.

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
I just like her as a friend.

294
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
You adore her.

295
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,300
I'll help you.

296
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Don't cause trouble,

297
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,000
or she'll stop coming over to our house.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Hey, don't stir trouble.

299
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Hold on. Someone's calling me.

300
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Hello, Mr. Ma. What's wrong?

301
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I'm helping my granny with her stall.

302
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,400
Okay, see you later.

303
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,700
Let's go.

304
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,600
Come on.

305
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay.

306
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,900
I should water the succulents today.

307
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,600
Why isn't he sitting here today?

308
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Strange.

309
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,900
Jiahui.

310
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
Why does this feel like...

311
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,800
Please.

312
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Great tea. Give me some next time.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Sure.

314
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,800
Chairman Xie,

315
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,400
I came here today to ask for your advice.

316
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,600
Speak your mind.

317
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,700
Where do youngsters go for dates?

318
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,900
The cafe.

319
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,400
Where do they go for work meetings?

320
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
The cafe.

321
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Where do they go when for casual chats and entrepreneurial discussions?

322
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Is this some kind of brainteaser?

323
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Still the cafe.

324
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Why don't they go to a teahouse?

325
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,600
Tea is equally good.

326
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,300
Besides, in China,

327
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,000
more people should be drinking tea.

328
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
Why aren't you asking me for an explanation?

329
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,100
Should I call Ye Sen over to entertain you?

330
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm being serious! Don't tease me.

331
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm getting restless!

332
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
You've stayed here for over a year.

333
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,100
It's about time for an entrepreneurial venture.

334
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Listen up.

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In my mind,

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,300
ideas for a new business

337
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,400
are sprouting rapidly

338
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
like bamboo trees after rain.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,100
I can't suppress them.

340
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,800
Every day, I sit there and meditate.

341
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,700
I want to empty my mind of thoughts.

342
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
If I really can't erase these thoughts,

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,400
I'll write them down on Xuan paper with a calligraphy brush every night.

344
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Then, I'll burn the paper with incense.

345
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,300
I'll let them drift off in the wind.

346
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,200
There is just one idea

347
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
that has lingered in my mind.

348
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,300
The more I contemplate, the clearer it gets.

349
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,600
The more I ruminate over it, the more concretely I can write it down.

350
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,400
When I close my eyes every night,

351
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I think about how to position and market a new teahouse—

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,700
And then how to finance it.

353
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,600
You can open branches and enter the market.

354
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,000
I didn't think that far.

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,600
I only wondered

356
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,500
how many branches can I open in the country.

357
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So, you want to set up a teahouse

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,400
where people can chat and date?

359
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
That's right.

360
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,900
Since there are cafes, why can't teahouses be popular, too?

361
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
I've researched this.

362
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Right now, there are some novel teahouses

363
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,000
aiming to brand themselves as a third space in the market.

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
But their goals aren't clear,

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
so they didn't achieve great success.

366
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
There is still much room for development,

367
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,200
optimization, and improvement.

368
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,400
Elaborate more.

369
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Okay.

370
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Let me explain in detail.

371
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,700
I like tea,

372
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,300
and I have some grasp of Chinese tea culture.

373
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,600
To be honest, modern folks,

374
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,900
especially youngsters,

375
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,500
don't know much about tea.

376
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,200
This is the perfect time

377
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,800
for professionals like us

378
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
to identify good tea for them

379
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,700
and educate them on the most ideal brewing methods.

380
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Only then can they truly appreciate the charms of tea and tea culture.

381
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,300
Most importantly,

382
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,100
we should keep up with the times.

383
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,000
We should also offer semi-tea drinks

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
that meet the tastes and needs of youngsters.

385
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,100
So, you want to broaden the concept of tea?

386
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,600
Exactly.

387
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
There won't be any gatekeeping.

388
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
No pretense of elegance either.

389
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,100
Chairman Xie, Chinese tea culture should be trendy.

390
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,800
It has to be rejuvenated.

391
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,400
Tea culture must seep into every corner of the world.

392
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
It has to be readily available.

393
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Even if you aren't interested,

394
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
you'll grow to like it.

395
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
This is how it works.

396
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
Where do you want the first store to be?

397
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
It must be a top city

398
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,300
like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, or Shenzhen.

399
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,200
However, development has to be consistent.

400
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,900
We must boost the brand influence of the first shop.

401
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,100
Will you put out peripheral products simultaneously?

402
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,200
Yes, these products have to be within reach in the shop.

403
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
You can reach for it instantly if you're interested.

404
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,000
If the first shop succeeds,

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,200
you can easily set up branches.

406
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,500
The market prospects and room for growth are promising.

407
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Chairman Xie.

408
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,800
Do you think this business is feasible?

409
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,400
I left investment evaluation ages ago.

410
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,100
I know that.

411
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,300
You've just been disapproving of my projects, and you refuse to invest in them.

412
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
Reality proves that my judgment is right.

413
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,700
What about this one?

414
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,300
Have you ever wondered why you're fixated

415
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,000
on this idea out of countless others?

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,600
Yes, I have.

417
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Because I like it.

418
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,300
It's something I want to do wholeheartedly.

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Are you sure you aren't chasing trends?

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Definitely not.

421
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Perfect.

422
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
Industry revitalizes the country.

423
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
I think you can give this a shot.

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
You won't discourage me?

425
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Once you get started,

426
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,700
problems will start popping up.

427
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
I don't need to deter you.

428
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
As for starting a business,

429
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
you're more experienced than I am.

430
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You've lived through more successes and failures than me.

431
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I should look up to you in this regard.

432
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,500
That's right.

433
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,300
- Okay, it's a deal then.
- All right.

434
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,600
I'll come up with the plan and you'll find investors.

435
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
Okay.

436
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
Nice.

437
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
First of all,

438
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I want to gather a research and development team.

439
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,800
I may need some start-up funds.

440
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Of course. Right?

441
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,900
But I have no money.

442
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Why are you staring at me?

443
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,000
I have no money either.

444
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,600
You... You're a boss.

445
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,500
Why... Why are you wasting your life on profitless businesses?

446
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,100
How can you criticize me? Do you have money?

447
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,000
You sold your house in Beijing to pay off your debts.

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Hey. Don't hit where it hurts.

449
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,600
Let's enjoy our tea first.

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Look at you blabber about tea culture.

451
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,600
- Is he in this class?
- Nope.

452
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,400
The class behind is his.

453
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,600
He hasn't come out yet.

454
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,100
You haven't seen him for six months?

455
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,500
Yes. I don't even know if I can recognize him.

456
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,600
- Here he is.
- Really?

457
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,000
That class.

458
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,600
Gather here, children. Stay in line.

459
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,100
Huzi!

460
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Huzi!

461
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm your mom.

462
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,100
Look! He's in a daze.

463
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm your mom. He doesn't dare come over.

464
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm your mom.

465
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,500
Huzi, it's dangerous here because there are a lot of cars.

466
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,800
Let me hold your hand. Okay?

467
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
Let me hold your hand.

468
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,700
Huzi, don't run.

469
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
It's dangerous.

470
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Slow down. Be careful.

471
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
I knew it. When the two of them get together,

472
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
they can't stop drinking.

473
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
- Have they gone to sleep?
- Yes, and so did Huzi.

474
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
Come on, I'll wash them.

475
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
It's okay. I'm almost done.

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,700
Why are you crying?

477
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm fine.

478
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,300
What's wrong? Tell me about it.

479
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,000
Did something happen?

480
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Mom, don't jump to conclusions.

481
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm fine.

482
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,300
Really? Well, why are you crying?

483
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I went to pick Huzi up today.

484
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
H-He didn't really recognize me.

485
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,100
He wouldn't even let me hold his hand.

486
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,900
He's lost his ties to us.

487
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Here you go.

488
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,200
Wipe your tears.

489
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,700
Don't cry.

490
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
I thought something terrible happened.

491
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,600
Here, wipe your tears.

492
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
Listen to me.

493
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Raising kids is no different from rearing dogs.

494
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Once you stay here for three days,

495
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
he'll cozy up to you.

496
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
Here, wipe your tears.

497
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't take this to heart.

498
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,100
Huzi is still young.

499
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,700
He'll understand when he grows older.

500
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,800
Really?

501
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Yes.

502
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,800
Actually, he also misses you guys.

503
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600
He's just shy.

504
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,500
When you were away, he'd often ask,

505
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,400
"When will my mom come back?"

506
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Really?

507
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes.

508
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I bet he just wants the new GG Bond.

509
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,600
You really know him best.

510
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,100
Mom, are you even trying to console me?

511
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,400
I am. I really am.

512
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,400
What else is there?

513
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,800
GG Bond! GG Bond!

514
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,600
My dad always brings yummy food when he comes back to visit me.

515
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
He'll even buy loads of storybooks for me.

516
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah, Tuotuo.

517
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Call them if you want anything.

518
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,300
Do you miss them?

519
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,400
Nope. A real man won't cry even if he bleeds.

520
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,900
I want my parents to work elsewhere, too.

521
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,400
If they do, I'll be able to play with the phone all day long.

522
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,600
Let me change the flavor of your food.

523
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,500
Does it taste good?

524
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,200
Aunty A'Gui.

525
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Try these chicken biscuits.

526
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
Aunty E brought them over in the morning.

527
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,600
I'll pass. You guys can enjoy them. I'm busy.

528
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Forget it. I'll try some.

529
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Just a second. Wait for me.

530
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,700
Take your time, and be careful.

531
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
Watch your step.

532
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800
I'm really sorry. I got up late.

533
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,100
It's okay.

534
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm not used to letting others wait.

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,300
You're way too serious as a consultant.

536
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,400
Everyone else feels bad slacking off.

537
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
That's right. The eunuch is more anxious than the emperor.

538
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,100
You're just a palace maid.

539
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
The eunuch isn't here yet.

540
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,300
You didn't sleep well last night?

541
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't even want to talk about it. My sister called me at midnight.

542
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She asked me to send birthday wishes to my mom on the dot.

543
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
After that, I couldn't fall back asleep.

544
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,000
I ended up watching a movie.

545
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
Your sister is brilliant. Doesn't she sleep?

546
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
She doesn't sleep before 1:00 a.m.

547
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
Is her work that demanding?

548
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,300
That's not it.

549
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,800
She has to fiddle with her phone for two hours before she sleeps.

550
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Bedtime procrastination.

551
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
What an oddball.

552
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Let's start.

553
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,600
Hold on. I'll call the eunuch and find out where he is.

554
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
I'm here!

555
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Stop calling. I'm here.

556
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,300
Did everyone just arrive?

557
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,700
See? This is our unique work style.

558
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
You've met him before, right?

559
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,400
He's our graphic designer, Ye Sen.

560
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
He's pretty smart.

561
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Let's get started.

562
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,300
Okay. The leader can start.

563
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll kick off with a comedy monologue.

564
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,900
It's called "All About Comedy."

565
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,500
Isn't that a comic dialogue?

566
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,200
Okay, enough.

567
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
Let's get down to business.

568
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,700
Our main focus today is the preliminary preparations

569
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,000
for welcoming the boss of Shaohua Bookstore.

570
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
I also hope to hear your opinions.

571
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,100
Besides premium resources like Shaohua Bookstore,

572
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,300
do we have any other methods to attract tourists?

573
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,900
I'll start the ball rolling.

574
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,000
A middle-range homestay

575
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and a high-end homestay will be constructed in our village.

576
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The tie-dye workshop offers hands-on experiences.

577
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We can conduct lessons in the embroidery workshop.

578
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,600
We also have the horse ranch and campsites in the area.

579
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
We have adequate infrastructure.

580
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Tourists can stay here contently for two days and one night.

581
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,000
In addition, I want to produce a short promotional video

582
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,400
to spotlight these facilities

583
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,300
and post it online.

584
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,800
It can also be played in our courtyard.

585
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,600
Unlike pamphlets,

586
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
this format is more appealing to visitors.

587
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
I think this is a great idea.

588
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
We also have the bookstore coming up.

589
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,100
So, I want to launch this promotional video as soon as possible.

590
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,300
We can gather the villagers to help out.

591
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,600
Xiao Huang can star in it.

592
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
Everyone else can follow Xiao Huang

593
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,000
to experience all these interesting spots,

594
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
admire the scenery, enjoy delicious food,

595
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,200
and appreciate the intangible cultural arts.

596
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
Hold on.

597
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,600
Why me?

598
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,300
Because you're bubbly and adorable.

599
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
Your affable nature will draw people in.

600
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Fine.

601
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,700
As long as the village's development can progress,

602
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,800
I'll do whatever you want me to.

603
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I even have a plan in mind.

604
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
The theme of the video

605
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
is "Meet Yourself."

606
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
Why settle on this theme?

607
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,700
Elaborate more.

608
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,200
This courtyard is called Youfeng Courtyard (Windy Courtyard)

609
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
because we hope every tenant here

610
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,300
can regain happiness in life.

611
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,000
The essence of wind is the flow of air.

612
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,600
Wind is formed when cold air flows toward hot air,

613
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,800
and the world is vitalized.

614
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Without wind, everything if lifeless.

615
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,600
Birds migrate to the south for the winter.

616
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
When people are feeling cold and dreary,

617
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,400
they seek warm places

618
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,800
to be rejuvenated by happiness and beauty.

619
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,100
It's the strength to restart their journeys.

620
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,100
Xiao Huang, do you have any questions?

621
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,800
It's a good idea,

622
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:09,200
but the village's budget...

623
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't worry.

624
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll sort out the funding.

625
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,700
That's what I wanted to hear.

626
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,800
It's settled then.

627
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,000
Ye Sen, share your thoughts.

628
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I need more time to contemplate.

629
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Didn't you come prepared?

630
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,800
Wasn't the plan to brainstorm together?

631
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,300
Why did you bring your laptop?

632
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
It's just a meeting prop.

633
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,000
Xu Hongdou, am I right?

634
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,400
No, I'm well prepared.

635
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,700
Aren't you just a consultant?

636
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,300
Yes, so I didn't prepare much.

637
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
Just about ten ideas.

638
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,500
I'm worried this unusual diligence will be a bad influence on us.

639
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,600
Xinxin, don't you agree?

640
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,800
You're right. I think all meetings involving you

641
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,600
will end up as chitchat sessions.

642
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,900
Shut up.

643
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Hongdou, you can share your thoughts.

644
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Here's what I think.

645
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,700
Doesn't our web store ship out tons of packages daily?

646
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,600
If we add a tourism pamphlet on Yunmiao Village in every package,

647
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,000
that'll leave an impression on customers.

648
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,800
When they are traveling to Dali,

649
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,700
they might choose to come here.

650
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,400
That's a good idea. We can implement it.

651
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,700
If we want to make a promotional video,

652
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,600
we can add a QR Code on the pamphlet.

653
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
- People can scan it and watch the video.
- Right.

654
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,400
That'll be perfect for a short video. I was just thinking of that.

655
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,200
♫ <i>Listen to the rain falling into the silent forest</i> ♫

656
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,080
♫ <i>Enjoy the mountainous landscape at sunset</i> ♫

657
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:01,000
♫ <i>The raindrops from the roof drip into my eyes quietly</i> ♫

658
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,200
♫ <i>The world is like a quiet island</i> ♫

659
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,000
♫ <i>The sky is turning bright without a sound</i> ♫

660
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,400
♫ <i>Waiting for the seabirds to call forth the ripples</i> ♫

661
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,600
♫ <i>Waiting for a ray of sunlight to shine across
the lake into my heart</i> ♫

662
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,000

♫ <i>The reflection of clouds, the changing moon,

664
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,950
Granny, it's too bright outside.

665
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,309
It's bad for your eyes.

666
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,829
It's good if it's bright.

667
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,530
If I laze about, I'll age faster.

668
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,690
You'll go blind.

669
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,250
Sorry. I mean,

670
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,350
there might be severe consequences.

671
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,769
Won't you go blind if you use your phone under the covers?

672
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:13,910
Won't you go blind if you stare at such a bright screen?

673
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,210
I think you guys will go blind first.

674
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,839
Well, just play with me.

675
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,740
Aren't I chatting with you?

676
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,640
Is chatting also considered playing?

677
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,789
Granny, when you aren't working, what do you enjoy doing?

678
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:36,490
I'll visit the neighbors.

679
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,810
Won't you play Mahjong?

680
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,030
I've been working my whole life.

681
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,840
I've never fooled around.

682
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,020
When I was young,

683
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,590
I didn't have warm clothes or enough food to eat.

684
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,219
The adults and children were all starving horribly.

685
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,420
Everyone worked for scraps of food.

686
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,770
I liked to sing when I was younger.

687
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,930
A'Yao's grandpa was a fabulous singer.

688
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,820
When we were tired of working in the fields,

689
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,360
he'd sing for me.

690
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,920
If he went fishing in the sea,

691
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
I'd wait for him at the bank.

692
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,030
He would come back while singing.

693
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,020
His voice was so beautiful.

694
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,290
A'Yao had an uncle,

695
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,660
but his lips were purple when he was born.

696
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,660
When he was five years old,

697
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,470
he couldn't breathe when he was running.

698
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,069
The hospital examination revealed that he had a hole in his heart.

699
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,900
It was congenital.

700
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,870
The hospital couldn't cure it.

701
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,050
We weren't as advanced as we are now. We had no medical insurance.

702
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,670
We borrowed quite a hefty sum of money,

703
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,290
but we hadn't even paid off the debt for our wedding and house.

704
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:09,810
At that time, A'Yao's dad was just a baby.

705
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,480
So,

706
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,810
I had to work harder.

707
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,540
That's how my life has been.

708
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,860
I've never had any fun.

709
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,770
Granny, wait here for me.

710
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,990
I need to fetch something.

711
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,860
I'll be right back.

712

♫ <i>Stars in the sky</i> ♫

713
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,759
I haven't mastered this yet!

714
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,130
One more time!

715
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,870
- Let's play another round!
- Okay, let's play again.

I'll choose the blue one this time!

♫ <i>The tower is tall</i> ♫

727
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,300
You cheated.

728
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,959
Granny, this is a difference of skill.

729
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,089
This isn't Mahjong. How can I cheat?

730
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,029
Food will be ready in ten minutes.

731
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,149
What are you playing?

732
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,759
Saving the penguin from the breaking ice.

733
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,070
It was delivered this morning. I wanted to give it to Tuotuo and the rest.

734
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,580
Why is granny so glum?

735
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,280
She lost.

736
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,790
She cheated.

737
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,980
Granny, you can't cheat in this game.

738
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,879
You can play with A'Yao.

739
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,500
Okay, sure. Come on.

740
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,999
Which color do you want?

741
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,070
I want red.

742
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,709
White, white.

743
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,800
I'll start first.

744
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,180
See? You're more experienced.

745
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,959
Let's go again.

746
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,500
One more time.

747
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,229
Granny.

748
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,980
You're a master now!

749
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,669
One more time.

750
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,100
Okay.

751
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,860
Did you two cheat?

752
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,959
This is a difference of skill.

753
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,569
This isn't Mahjong. How can I cheat?

754
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,479
I bet Hongdou taught you how to cheat.

755
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,570
Are you a sore loser?

756
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,230
You cheated, and taught Granny to cheat.

757
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,069
She's angry because I hit the nail on the head.

758
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,070
You're becoming more and more like Granny.

759
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,109
I won't play with cheaters.

760
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,200
Pack up and eat.

761
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,500
You're such a terrible opponent.

762
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,550
He's a sore loser.

763
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:14,320
Sore loser. Sore loser!

764
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,129
<i>You finally have a few months of vacation,</i>

765
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,050
<i>but you've started working for them.</i>

766
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,280
<i>How much does he pay you?</i>

767
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,179
I'm a volunteer. I think it's quite meaningful.

768
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:27,490
Besides, he pays for my meals.

769
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,710
Oh no.

770
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,310
You've been brainwashed by that village beau.

771
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,399
Brainwashing is the forte of capitalists.

772
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,430
Do you need him to pay for your meals?

773
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,410
Is he offering you exorbitant delicacies?

774
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,500
Yes, it's really quite delicious.

775
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,760
He must be extraordinary if he can brainwash Dou.

776
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,529
<i>She's working as free labor now,</i>

777
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,179
but I bet I'll have to save her from a pyramid scheme soon.

778
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:54,069
<i>Fabulous, my dear sister.</i>

779
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,810
I can let myself be brainwashed without a care.

780
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,210
You words will never anger me.

781
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,980
Speak your mind. I won't be upset.

782
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,209
<i>You've made progress.</i>

783
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:10,069
I think it's good to take a breather elsewhere.

784
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,930
You'll broaden your mind, won't you?

785
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,279
Mom, I sent you the fried termite mushroom oil

786
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:19,799
and dried porcini made by Granny Xie.

787
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,200
Remember to claim the parcels.

788
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,589
How am I supposed to eat those?

789
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,325
I'll send you the recipes.

790
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:28,250
Let's end the call. I need to eat. My food is cooked.

791
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,669
Are you having supper?

792
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,830
You'll get fat.

793
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,600
Thank you for your blessing.

794
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,560
Bye-bye.

795
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,659
Go to sleep early. Bye-bye.

796
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,190
Bye.

797
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,249
- Is it ready, Hongdou?
- Yes.

798
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:50,308
I'll invite Damai to eat with us.

799
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,980
Watch the pot.

800
