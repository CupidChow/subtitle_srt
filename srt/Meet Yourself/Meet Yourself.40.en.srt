<i>[Episode 40]</i>

3
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,500
My friend introduced me to a businessman

4
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
who works with handicraft exports.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I have an appointment with him tomorrow in the afternoon.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,100
After we send the stuff back in the morning, you can come with me for the meeting.

7
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,900
There's no need for that. Let's split up for the day.

8
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,200
A colleague of my friend is working as a travel consultant.

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
He can advise me on useful resources.

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay.

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
What's wrong?

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,600
What's on your mind when you're looking at this clock?

13
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Time.

14
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,200
I always feel that it's the embodiment of our hotel.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm just a gear in it.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,600
Every part of this time device is working together

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
to maintain the clock's precision.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,300
Beautiful, isn't it?

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
I can only see time.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
That's because you're a customer.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
You, too, are a customer now.

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I am.

23
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
- Hongdou!
- Manager Liu!

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
- It's been a long time.
- I haven't seen you in a while.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
I heard you came back, but I didn't manage to catch you.

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,100
- Who's this?
- This is my boyfriend.

27
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,900
He's my former colleague from the Housekeeping Department, Manager Liu.

28
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,100
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
I'd better let you go. I still have other tasks to attend to.

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,400
If you need anything, come looking for me.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,700
- Sure, see you.
- See you.

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Why did he call your name straight up?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
He used to like me.

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Really?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm not down for office romance.

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,100
You have so many rules!

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Why are there flowers here?

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
Is this part of the service?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,700
Manager Xu, you're always welcome to come home.

40
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,900
Wish you and Mr. Xie a blissful and fulfilling life.

41
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,400
Nice, isn't it?

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
- Take your time.
- Okay.

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,500
Let me show you around.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,100
The kitchen and the dining room are on the first floor,

45
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,400
as well as all the lounges. The tea room there is included.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,700
All these are for common use.

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,400
However, you must clean up

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,600
after you use the areas.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
The housekeeper is only responsible

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
for cleaning public areas.

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,400
Here, your room is on the second floor.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
Be careful when you come up the stairs.

53
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,200
Okay.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,200
Be careful.

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
This room over here.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Mr. Hu!

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
- Let me introduce some new neighbors. Miao Miao and Xiao Gang.
- This is Mr. Hu.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,200
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Hu.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
Come on in.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,900
Welcome.

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,000
Take a look around.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
<i>- What do you think?
- Excellent.</i>

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,660
<i>If you have any problems, just let me know.</i>

64
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>Okay.</i>

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,620
<i>[The path to freedom]</i>

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
<i>They need to be in the sun.</i>

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,500
<i>Only then can the leaves grow</i>

68
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
<i>with a lush green shade.</i>

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>This is the process of photosynthesis.</i>

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
<i>Got it?</i>

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
What's the matter?

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
- I don't feel good.
- What's ailing you?

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
My heart is ailing me.

74
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
Your heart?

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
You drink, smoke, and stay up late all day long.

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
You had that coming.

77
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Old Hu, I don't want to chide you.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,600
We live together and take care of each other,

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
but we can't always be there for you.

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
No matter who is sick,

81
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,900
we can go to the hospital and take care of them for a few days.

82
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,300
However, if you're seriously ill, your parents are the ones shouldering the burden.

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,170
Is that what you want?

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Stop shaking your head.

85
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
What in the world is wrong with your heart?

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Should I take you to the hospital?

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
Xiaochun...

88
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
I want to go to Beijing.

89
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,400
Go on.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,800
What now?

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,900
You want me to lend you some money to buy a ticket?

92
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Aren't you going to ask me why I want to go there?

93
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Nope, I'm not asking.

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm not your dad, nor am I your mom.

95
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,600
You have no sense of humanity.

96
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Aren't we friends?

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,300
The dog always chases its food.

98
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
I can read your mind.

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
Who are you calling a dog?

100
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Who? You're the dog.

101
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,900
- You...
- A bastard.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Make a trip if you want to.

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Sister Manjun is much older than you,

105
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,500
but she still has the courage to start over.

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
You're so young. Work hard.

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm sure there'll be opportunities for you,

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
but I need to caution you.

109
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,200
The cost of living in big cities is extremely high.

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,100
Your life will be tough if you keep muddling along like this.

111
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,700
Got it?

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
You also need to know this.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Even if you're there,

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
you shouldn't get your hopes up.

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
You should let nature take its course when it comes to love.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,700
All right! It's settled then.

117
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,100
If you don't renew your lease, your lease will only last until the end of this month.

118
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,600
I'll put up an advertisement for rental ten days in advance.

119
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
H-Hey... I haven't made my decision.

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Spend a few more days contemplating. That's no problem.

121
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,200
Anyway, if you check out on short notice,

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
I won't refund the deposit.

123
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,100
You're such a heartless woman.

124
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,200
Am I heartless?

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>[The path to freedom]</i>

126
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
My girl is so pretty.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
I'll tie a pretty braid for you.

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Mom!

129
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,100
What brings you here today?

130
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,000
He picked me up today.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
I was delivering goods to customers close by,

132
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,600
so I stopped by to see Xiao Hu Lu.

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,100
I called your mom,

134
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,400
and she asked me to pick her up.

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll sleep in the homestay in town tonight.

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll start cooking.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
There aren't many ingredients at home, so it'll be a simple meal.

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't eat here. I'll be off soon.

139
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
What's with you? Xiao Hu Lu missed you.

140
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Leave after the meal.

141
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Fine.

142
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Let me help you with cooking.

143
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Sure.

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Luo Quan, your mom called me and told me your dad

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
was pretty harsh with the beating.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
Are you okay now?

147
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm fine now.

148
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
I heard that you went on a blind date recently.

149
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,800
How's the girl?

150
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
We've known each other for years,

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,600
so you should know me quite well.

152
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I have a short fuse.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Sometimes, I talk without thinking

154
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
and my words are harsh.

155
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,400
I also have personality flaws.

156
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
So, our divorce isn't entirely your fault.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
I have many issues as well.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,900
One more thing. Don't take anything I said to you to heart.

159
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,400
In fact, I'm well aware

160
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,200
that you aren't a person who is lazy.

161
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I know that you drank with customers

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,100
to sell water purifiers just to earn more money for the family.

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,000
I was too young.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
After we had a child,

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I felt that our life was a mess.

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,500
At that time, we weren't mature enough when dealing with problems.

167
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,700
We had a narrow perspective on things and were inexperienced.

168
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,100
As a result, our emotions overwhelmed us.

169
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,500
That's not true, Xiaochun.

170
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
It was my fault.

171
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,000
When we got married, I made a promise to you.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,700
I would give you happiness.

173
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,000
But...

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,100
We were just too young.

175
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,300
We can't expect happiness from someone else.

176
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,540
Anyway, I've always felt that I let you down.

177
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,070
Don't say that, Luo Quan.

178
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,560
I never regretted marrying you,

179
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,180
and I never regretted giving birth to Xiao Hu Lu.

180
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,660
Although we aren't a couple anymore,

181
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,570
I think we're living our respective lives well.

182
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,039
You need to stop apologizing.

183
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,049
We should let go of the past and look ahead. Okay?

184
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,240
Peel the beans.

185
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,000
Fry this one first. After that, add this in.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,680
Got it. You need to turn it over slightly.

187
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,410
Gently. Yes, be gentle.

188
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,700
- Welcome back!
- We're back!

189
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,520
What are you cooking? It smells delicious.

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,000
We're frying fish!

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,780
Frying little fishes, like me.

192
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,420
Aunty A'Gui is making something tasty. We've all eaten.

193
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,650
- Put your luggage away and come down for food!
- Sure.

194
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,979
- Okay.
- We'll get the luggage upstairs first.

195
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:12,770
Okay.

196
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,200
Na Na, flip it over! It's going to burn!

197
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,420
Aunty A'Gui, your food is good enough to be served in a restaurant.

198
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,800
A restaurant? I'm not good enough for that.

199
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,149
I'm just cooking with whatever ingredients are available. Right, Na Na?

200
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,740
- Yes.
- Don't be too humble.

201
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,120
Aunty Hua said that if you set up a restaurant,

202
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,360
Galsang Flower Restaurant will be out of business.

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,869
What a glib tongue! Showering me with all that flattery!

204
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,250
By the way, Mr. Hu is going to Beijing.

205
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,200
Going to Beijing?

206
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,060
Xiao Hu is going to Beijing to pursue love!

207
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,690
Don't say that!

208
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,409
I'm going to look for a job.

209
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,690
What's so embarrassing about pursuing love? Right?

210
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,730
Exactly! A goal is always good.

211
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,259
What about your job?

212
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,620
I haven't found one yet.

213
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,270
I plan to apply for a job in the production department of a music company.

214
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,240
I still want to work with music. Perhaps I'll be able to release an album.

215
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,800
That'd be amazing!

216
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,230
You should've done so eons ago. What a lazy bum.

217
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,520
Screw you!

218
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,700
Eons ago, I was just a bug in a stone crack.

219
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,550
There's a fabulous saying.

220
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,730
The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago.

221
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,180
The next best time is now.

222
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,000
You shouldn't be called Hu Youyu.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You should be called Hu Youli.
<i>("Youli" meaning "finding excuses")</i>

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,410
In my opinion, Hu Youli is a nice name.

225
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,650
I'll consider changing my name.

226
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,240
By the way, today is my last day performing at the bar.

227
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,420
I'd like to invite everyone over to enjoy my last show together.

228
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,650
- What do you think?
- No problem.

229
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,590
Chairman Xie and I can't go.

230
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,600
A horse is giving birth at the horse ranch today. We need to head there.

231
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
What? You need to accompany a horse for its delivery?

232
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,889
Not exactly. The foal is in an abnormal fetal position. That's why I'm worried.

233
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,540
Aunty A'Gui hasn't been to a bar. Go and feel the vibes.

234
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,290
No, I can't go. People like us aren't suitable for such a place.

235
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,500
It's filled with loonies dancing and shouting wildly.

236
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm not going.

237
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
- There aren't any loonies.
- I'm not going.

238
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,140
Aunty A'Gui, Mr. Hu works at a bar that serves non-alcoholic drinks.

239
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,140
It's not noisy there.

240
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,870
I won't go no matter what.

241
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,730
You've never been there. Let's go together.

242
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,340
Nope. I'm going to bed at 9:00.

243
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,999
You should take on new challenges!

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Just grab a drink and come back. It won't take up much of your time.

245
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,340
No, I'm not going.

This isn't a concert.

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,290
In the olden days, even when girls sang,

257
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,100
the audience would clap for her.

Stop talking about the old days.

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah.

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,050
The alcohol here only costs ¥3 in the supermarket.

261
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,340
I'm sure it costs at least ¥5 here.

262
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,549
Think about it.

263
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,400
If it's only ¥5, how will they make money? Look over there.

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,020
¥18.

265
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,920
- ¥18?
- Yeah!

266
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,290
The price was inflated to ¥18 after they brought it over from the supermarket?

267
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,140
How much does this cost?

268
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,280
¥48.

269
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,499
Take a look. After they brought it over from the supermarket? It costs ¥48.

270
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:14,529
That's way too expensive.

271
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,120
You shouldn't think like this. They need to make money.

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,320
Aunty Baoping, don't worry about the money.

273
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,120
It's Mr. Hu's treat today.

274
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,460
We just have to enjoy ourselves.

275
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:27,799
That's right. These are so expensive.

276
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,770
Xia Xia, stop fiddling with your phone. These are expensive. Eat up.

277
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,650
Stop using your phone.

278
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,080
I'm replying to work messages.

279
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,400
Where did you get the chicken feet?

280
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,050
I brought it myself. Want to have one?

281
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,100
Are you stupid?

282
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,710
You don't want to eat this platter worth ¥48, but you brought your own snacks?

283
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,710
Put it away. Eat this first.

I think they're a great match.

Why aren't they a good match? I think they're perfect for each other. All right?

300
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,140
Enough with that.

301
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,160
Xia Xia is still young. Look, his face is flushed.

302
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,839
Stop talking about this. It's not fun.

Stop teasing him. My little brother is feeling embarrassed.

I'm telling you the truth now because I don't want to lie in the future.

I'll definitely cajole and lie to you in time to come.

I'll be narrow-minded, selfish, and jealous. Right?

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,910
- How was your trip?
- Great.

485
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,240
- Granny, I finally get to meet you!
- This place is wonderful, like a paradise.

486
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,810
How have you been?

487
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,770
I've been great! Take these.

488
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,549
You shouldn't have bought so many things.

489
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,880
- Come on.
- I brought specialties from my hometown for you to try.

490
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,150
Have a seat!

491
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,570
Where's A'Yuan?

492
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,550
He's about to take the college entrance examinations.

493
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,809
- There's a horse.
- What a nice place!

494
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:38,550
- Fantastic.
- Do you drink?

495
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,070
I seldom drink.

496
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,050
- Dou always restrains me. She won't let me drink.
- Forget about her when you're here.

497
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,450
That's right. Forget about her for today.

498
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,880
Look at those unbelievable socializing skills.

499
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,920
What are we compared to them?

500
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,110
Nothing but a eunuch before the emperor.

501
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,580
Got to say, "Yep!"

502
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,949
When a eunuch meets the emperor, he has to say, "Yes!"

503
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:58,940
"Yep!"

504
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,650
Fine. As you say.

505
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,540
Xia Xia!

506
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,069
Aren't you supposed to be in the homestay?

507
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,639
I came to get something. Where are you going?

508
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,250
I wanted to take a look at your homestay.

509
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,999
Sure. I'll treat you to coffee.

510
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,810
Sister Na Na, I'm leaving.

511
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,170
Leaving? Where are you going?

512
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,509
I'm going to a wood carving workshop in Xiamen to improve my skills.

513
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:31,969
Did you tell your master?

514
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,319
Yes, I told him. He's supportive of me.

515
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,660
Besides, I plan on coming back.

516
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,610
Good for you.

517
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,550
Such an abrupt piece of news makes me hesitant to let you go.

518
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,819
We always meet, but you're leaving for such a faraway place.

519
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,650
Really?

520
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,120
Will you reply to my text messages?

521
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,370
Of course, I will. Why would I ignore your messages?

522
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,680
It's a promise then.

523
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:13,680
Xia Xia... I've always treated you as a younger brother.

524
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,990
I know. It's okay.

525
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,640
Take good care of yourself when you're in Xiamen.

526
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,300
I will.

527
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,740
Whose cattle left so much dung here?

528
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,900
It must've been a herd of cattle.

529
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,070
I'm back again!

530
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,660
It's still the same. Nothing has changed.

531
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,639
Look. The futon you meditated on hasn't been worn out yet.

532
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:03,559
Sorry. This is a private residence. Visitors aren't allowed to enter.

533
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,649
Hello. We used to live here, so we're just stopping by.

534
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:12,470
Gentlemen, this place isn't open to visitors and pictures aren't allowed.

535
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,560
- Aunty A'Gui!
- Aunty A'Gui!

536
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,710
Xiao Hu! Mr. Ma! How are you?

537
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,240
- I'm good.
- Excellent.

538
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,739
I'm sorry about that.

539
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,150
There are a lot more tourists in the village,

540
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,670
and there are people trying to take photos all day long.

541
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,500
Are you here to travel?

542
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,409
President Xu's homestay is having a soft opening.

543
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,570
She reserved two rooms for us. So, we decided to take a vacation here this weekend.

544
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,380
Wonderful!

545
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,340
How has your work been?

546
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,210
Thanks to your blessings, I've been doing great.

547
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,679
Me too. Sister Manjun is doing fabulously.

548
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,080
That's wonderful!

549
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,350
What about you? How are you doing?

550
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,050
Of course, I'm doing good.

551
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,219
In the spring, I even went for a health examination.

552
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,360
I checked my stomach and intestines, but there aren't any problems.

553
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,030
The doctor said I'm healthier

554
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,440
than youngsters like you guys.

555
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,940
- Nothing is more important than health.
- That's great.

556
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,500
He is Xiao Hu, who used to live in your room.

557
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,520
Hello.

558
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,060
We'll head to the homestay first.

559
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,229
We won't bother you.

560
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:14,199
Sure. I'll look for you guys tonight.

561
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,250
Sure. You must come over.

562
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,000
Take good care of that room.

563
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,760
Why are you rubbing your soles? Is it dung?

564
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,260
That's good luck!

565
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,450
I'll leave all of it here for you! All for you!

566
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,640
- Let's go.
- Okay. See you tonight.

567
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,760
Okay. See you tonight.

568
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,809
Mr. Ma, there has been so much publicity for your store lately.

569
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,220
Are you going to set up a branch?

570
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,880
Blind optimism is inadvisable.

571
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,929
Many tea stores have entered the market this year, but all of them were too similar.

572
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:46,230
- The market has become extremely competitive.
- Competition is good.

573
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,720
That means there are prospects.

574
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,450
Everyone is diving into the market.

575
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,189
Mr. Hu, what's going on with you and Sister Manjun?

576
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,030
We're da-ting! We're a couple!

577
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,629
- Da-ting? Dating? Still dating?
- Leave us be.

578
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:02,320
What about you? Do you have a boyfriend now?

579
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,860
What do you mean? You're looking down on me, aren't you?

580
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,109
Listen up.

581
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm just uninterested. It's not that there aren't wooers. Got it?

582
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,880
I know. There was that guy called A'Hui, right?

583
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,280
That was like 800 years ago.

584
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
He even sent me a wedding invitation six months ago.

585
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,090
He might even have a baby now.

586
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,230
Stop joking about that.

587
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,929
Hongdou, where are your parents?

588
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,480
They're playing Mahjong at Chairman Xie's place.

589
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,190
I'm going to pop the champagne!

590
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,250
Here.

591
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,500
Let me pour drinks for you guys.

592
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,469
Come on. Let's drink.

593
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,560
Here you go.

594
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,180
- Awesome.
- Here.

595
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,310
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

596
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,219
Are you guys ready?

597
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:45,449
President Xu, say something!

598
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,879
Applause!

599
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,270
- Everyone, applause!
- Give a speech!

600
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,900
- A long one!
- All right.

601
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,160
Today is the soft opening of Gentle Breeze Homestay.

602
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,699
I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to my dear friends from all over the world

603
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:06,019
who have gathered here to witness this new chapter of my career.

604
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,209
How time flies. A year has passed.

605
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,039
When I first came here, I wasn't in a great state of mind.

606
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,520
I met all of you.

607
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,030
We had our own troubles.

608
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,210
Fortunately, we've overcome those.

609
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,020
Now that I'm meeting you again,

610
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,769
your lives and everything else are back on the right track.

611
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,210
I truly feel happy for you.

612
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,000
Of course, I'm thankful for Chairman Xie.

613
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,820
His Youfeng Courtyard gave us,

614
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,060
who were struggling in the world,

615
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,260
an opportunity and space to take a break...

616
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,130
and get to know each other.

617

619
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,139
Come on!

620
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,650
Everyone! Wait a moment!

621
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,960
We'll stick with the usual!

622
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,070
Make a toast before drinking.

623
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,149
I'll start.

624
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,340
May all your wishes come true.

625
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,710
Great! May our village have a good harvest this year!

626
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,110
What's wrong? Isn't that acceptable?

627
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,290
It is!

628
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,310
May our country have everlasting peace and harmony!

629
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,030
Bravo! World peace!

630
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,130
Universal peace!

631
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,699
Get rich!

632
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:49,929
May all lovers have their happy-ever-afters.

633
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,929
May the happiness of today last!

634
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,700
Many happy returns like today!

635
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,930
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,029
When are you going to Huangshan to participate in the homestay conference?

645
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:40,040
This Friday.

646
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,409
I can't drive you to the airport.

647
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:44,559
I have to go to Beijing on Thursday for a business meeeting.

648
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,840
Let's just work on our own tasks.

649
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,970
Don't book a ticket for me.

650
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,710
This expense should be reimbursed by the corporate account.

651
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,610
Okay. We'll play by the rules.

652
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,200
There are so many stars.

653
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I wonder which one is your grandma,

654
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,810
which one is Chen Nanxing,

655
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,720
and which one... is my mom.

656
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,380
I don't know.

658
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,760
What's wrong?

659
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,840
I wish time could stop in this moment.

660
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,190
At this very moment,

661
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,210
I feel we're hurtling toward happiness.

662
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,020
Let time stop.

663
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,930
Let's count to three.

664
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,970
Will time really stop?

665
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,760
Give it a shot.

666
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,610
Try it.

667
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>One.</i>

668
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,740
<i>Two.</i>

669
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,580
Three.
