3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,220
Daddy, I'm scared.

4
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,660
Why are you scared?

5
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,279
Uncle A'Yao is frozen. Is he dead?

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,060
Slap him and find out.

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,320
No, I'm scared.

8
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,310
Is he really dead?

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,790
Look! The flies are buzzing around him.

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,140
Stop crying.

11
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,760
Your crying woke him from the dead!

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,290
Yang Guanjun! What's your problem?

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,680
Why did you scare him?

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,250
Guobao, come here. Come on.

15
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,200
Ignore what he said.

16
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,079
Come on. We'll ignore him.

17
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,499
Don't take his words seriously. Okay?

18
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:36,379
There, there. Look, I'm still breathing. Come on.

19
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,859
I'm still breathing, right? I can still fart.

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
- Smells good?
- When my dad does that at home,

21
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,820
my mom always says he stinks.

22
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,680
Do you like me?

23
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,819
- Call me dad.
- Dad.

24
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,539
- Say it again.
- Dad. Dad.

25
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,560
Give dad a kiss.

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,480
Good boy.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,100
Mom.

28
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,800
Sister-in-law.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm just kidding.

30
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,299
Is one enough? I have another egg here.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,960
Do you need one more?

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,800
- I don't need it.
- You deserved it.

33
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,920
What's wrong?

34
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,960
He hit on my wife.

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,020
It's swelling!

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,800
Why did you come so late?

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,980
Is a shareholders' meeting of two people that long?

38
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,680
Does it hurt?

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm fine.

40
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,040
We chatted for a bit.

41
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,519
What happened this afternoon? You looked upset.

42
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,420
There's no need to keep things from me.

43
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,519
It's just work. Everything's a mess.

44
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,440
There aren't major issues, but loads of minor problems.

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,039
You looked like you were facing irresolvable problems.

46
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,680
Even I'm used to that.

47
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,320
When he stumbles a little, he ends up with that constipated look.

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,920
Enough. I haven't finished my dinner. You're so disgusting.

49
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,040
You aren't the king of me.

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,860
Look at Hongdou.

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,700
Oh, I should call you President Xu.

52
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,400
Renovations are so tiring, but she's still so energetic.

53
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,150
Look at you.

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,200
How can you compare us?

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,380
President Xu's homestay isn't open yet.

56
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,360
When you first took over and renovated the tie-dye workshop,

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,350
you got drunk and cried at my house.

58
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,599
You were complaining about our dad being a pain—

59
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,900
Enough. Stop rambling. Leave me some dignity.

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,720
Really? Tell me more.

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,890
You know, his tears were like a waterfall.

62
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,210
All right, that's enough.

63
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,059
President Xu, I admit that you're superior.

64
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,179
- I'll down this can of beer.
- No, don't.

65
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,299
The rest is mine.

66
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:06,339
Stop. I didn't even drink much.

67
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,300
Leave me some.

68
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,780
Leave some for me.

69
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,880
Please.

70
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,419
Give it to me, or I'll drink from your lips.

71
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,080
Mom.

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
- Mom.
- Mom!

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
You're back. Take a shower and get some rest.

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
Where's Luo Quan?

75
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,379
Luo Quan? Did he come here?

76
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,939
Yeah, I asked him to come over.

77
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,700
My dad is here?

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,160
Hold on. I'll give him a call.

79
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,119
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed is unvailable.</i>

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,680
He didn't answer?

81
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,819
I guess he's busy. Leave him be.

82
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,640
I'll go upstairs first.

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,040
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed is unvailable.</i>

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,480
<i>Please try again later.</i>

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,840
Mom,

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,960
did Luo Quan contact you?

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,920
<i>He went to meet you, didn't he?</i>

88
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,679
Yeah, I met him in the afternoon, but I was busy with work.

89
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:52,239
I asked him to wait for me at home, but he didn't come.

90
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,040
He isn't answering my calls now.

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,940
<i>Did he talk to you about Xiao Hu Lu?</i>

92
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,519
Yeah, he did. Mom,

93
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,020
thank you for your understanding.

94
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,579
Don't worry. When Xiao Hu Lu is on vacation, I'll let her visit you guys in Kunming.

95
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,960
<i>He didn't tell you how he convinced his dad, did he?</i>

96
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,219
<i>He told his dad that you won't remarry him anyway.</i>

97
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,390
<i>He'll attend any blind dates we set up.</i>

98
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,150
<i>He said that if he wants to remarry,</i>

99
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,319
<i>having a child with him would be a turnoff.</i>

100
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,240
<i>It's better for the child to live with you.</i>

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,519
<i>His dad was so angry he used a leather belt to beat him up.</i>

102
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,020
<i>There were so many bruises on him from that.</i>

103
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,280
<i>- Xiaochun.</i>
- Mom.

104
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,419
<i>Please take him to the hospital.</i>

105
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,299
Why did he say that to Dad?

106
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,699
<i>Xiaochun, you know him.</i>

107
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,659
<i>He isn't so mean. If he really thinks that way... You've already been divorced for three years.</i>

108
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,559
<i>He could've started a new life ages ago.</i>

109
00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:00,039
<i>He's just trying to fulfill your wishes, and took the blame.</i>

110
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,799
<i>Please treat him well in the future and speak with him amicably.</i>

111
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,579
<i>Don't always flare up at him.</i>

112
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,699
<i>Even if he isn't your husband now,</i>

113
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,219
<i>- he's still Xiao Hu Lu's dad. Right?</i>
- Mom.

114
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,780
<i> - Luo Quan!
- Yeah. Mom.</i>

115
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,960
<i>Why did you come back without telling us?</i>

116
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,419
<i>Come on. Talk to Xiaochun.</i>

117
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,680
<i>She's worried sick.</i>

118
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,620
<i>Xiaochun, I was parking in the garage.</i>

119
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,080
<i>There's no signal in the elevator.</i>

120
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,319
Okay. It's fine as long as you're safe.

121
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,920
- I'll hang up.
<i>- Hey—</i>

122
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,140
Who's so nonsensical?

123
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,660
Probably some rebellious punks.

124
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,179
Look at this painting. This position.

125
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,340
It should be about the same height as me.

126
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
The painting is so ugly.

127
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,940
Only one store in town sells spray paint. Right?

128
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,080
What if it was bought online?

129
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,879
Forget it. Just let it go. It's probably just a prank.

130
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,520
We can install two surveillance cameras at the entrance.

131
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,580
It's about time to get them anyway.

132
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,759
I've ordered the cameras. I just haven't received them yet.

133
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,400
You're right about needing them. We'll have more stuff here soon.

134
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't worry, it's okay.

135
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,820
I'll get someone to change your front door.

136
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,000
I think something's off.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,200
- In what way?
- I'm not sure.

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,919
Look. When I meet the villagers, they're always talking about me.

139
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,710
Isn't that normal?

140
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,590
When a merchant arrives in the village,

141
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,350
he'll be talked about by everyone wherever he goes.

142
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,060
The villagers will gather

143
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,680
and say that lady is A'Yao's girlfriend.

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,059
This beautiful lady sure has great taste.

145
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,440
She knows A'Yao is a good catch.

146
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Y-You're so cheeky!

147
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,520
Why don't they say.

148
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,260
"Look at this pretty lady!

149
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,570
I don't know why she likes A'Yao!

150
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,860
What does she want from him?"

151
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,840
Maybe she fell for my handsome looks.

152
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,300
Granny said you'll be ugly when you're old.

153
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,280
She's lying.

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,739
Get going. Here you go.

155
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,040
Wait!

156
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,580
Give me a hug.

157
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,179
I'll prepare a good dinner for you.

158
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,300
It's okay, I'll cook. What do you want to eat?

159
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,279
No, thanks. Your soy sauce proportions from your hometown should be kept back home.

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,539
A chokehold is cheating.

161
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,560
What's wrong? My mom taught me that.

162
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,779
Okay, you win. I have to go.

163
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,240
- Be careful.
- I'm off.

164
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,580
Bye-bye.

165
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,420
Xiaochun, are you in the shop or in the warehouse?

166
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,619
Can you head to the spray paint store in town

167
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,100
and ask if any villagers bought white spray paint recently?

168
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,699
Okay. Tell me once you find out.

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,640
Bye.

170
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,300
Hongdou! Hongdou!

171
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,100
Aunty A'Gui.

172
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,900
I'm here to look at your homestay‘s renovations.

173
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,700
It looks the same as before.

174
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,400
The yard is the last area to be altered.

175
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,100
So, you can't tell the difference now.

176
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Have some tea.

177
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay, I'll have some tea.

178
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,200
Aunty A'Gui, are you bringing lunch to Uncle Zeqing?

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Nope.

180
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm done with my work,

181
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,000
so I'm bored to be alone.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm just walking around and enjoying my time.

183
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
When I'm at the warehouse,

184
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,300
Xiaoyue will stare at me like this.

185
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,100
She hasn't said a word, but I know what she's going to say.

186
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,400
"Why are you here again?"

187
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
They want me to leave once I enter.

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,800
Aunty Feng and Aunty Baoping are working.

189
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
If you chat with them,

190
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,100
their work is bound to be affected.

191
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,800
So, I'm here to chat with you.

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
You're more than welcome!

193
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
Hongdou.

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,400
There have been rumors spreading in the village.

195
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,700
Have you heard about them?

196
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,600
If you don't tell me, I wouldn't know.

197
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,700
They're saying many people in the village

198
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
want to earn a windfall.

199
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
They want to change their own homes into homestays.

200
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,400
Some villagers want to open clothing stores,

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,200
others want to take a loan for a car.

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,700
So, they went to the village committee to inquire.

203
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,400
The village committee then sought A'Yao's opinions.

204
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Here's where things start. The gossip was birthed.

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,600
They said A'Yao gave all kinds of reasons to stop them.

206
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
They think A'Yao is afraid that more competition

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
will cause him to lose customers.

208
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,600
They also said A'Yao wants to rake in money and monopolize the market.

209
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
He wants all the profits for himself.

210
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,000
They said that A'Yao knew the bookstore would be set up here,

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,100
so he let his girlfriend

212
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,200
rent this place in advance.

213
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,100
You two can earn money together.

214
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
A'Yao never stopped their ideas.

215
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,200
Who started these rumors?

216
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
No clue.

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,700
It started several days ago.

218
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,200
I don't know who started this nonsense.

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Aunty A'Gui, I rented this homestay

220
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
because the previous owner had personal issues

221
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
and had to sell it.

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
No one wanted to take over.

223
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,100
I know about that.

224
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,300
At that time, Xiao Huang and A'Yao were so anxious.

225
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,400
I witnessed all of that.

226
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,800
Hongdou, don't take this to heart.

227
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,600
These people were mocking you back then,

228
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
but they're also jealous of you now.

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,500
Even A'Yao knows about these rumors.

230
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,200
Someone else would've gone knocking at their doors for a fight.

231
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,900
A'Yao just smiled it off

232
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,700
and ignored them.

233
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
These villagers are too rude.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
How can they gossip right before him?

235
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,800
That's why I have always said A'Yao was meant for success.

236
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,600
He's so kind and gracious. Right?

237
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,300
Granny! I have a bath towel.

238
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,600
You don't have to...

239
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,700
Xu Hongdou? Wait!

240
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
You're in shorts.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
I can't see anything.

242
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
You fled pretty fast.

243
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,300
Why did you come here so late at night?

244
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm here to see you.

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Didn't you say that you'll meet the suppliers tomorrow

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and only be back in two days?

247
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Can't you live without me?

248
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Fine, I'll leave.

249
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,000
Hongdou! Come back.

250
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Have you heard about those strange rumors lately?

251
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
What rumors?

252
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
People are saying that you stop them from running businesses

253
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,500
because you want to monopolize the profits.

254
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,000
They think you know about the bookstore's opening,

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,700
so you let your girlfriend run a homestay.

256
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,400
Who told you about these?

257
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,100
Did someone gossip before you?

258
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,000
Not before me,

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
but I have a know-all friend.

260
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,200
A know-all friend?

261
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Aunty A'Gui?

262
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Bingo.

263
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Were you aware of all these?

264
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,300
Ignore their nonsense.

265
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,200
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to be upset

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
when you heard about them.

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,000
They've already spray-painted my entrance!

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,300
Weren't you going to tell me?

269
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,600
Don't worry about this.

270
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I'll handle it.

271
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,500
You can't just tell me good news

272
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
and hide all the bad news.

273
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,700
You aren't a living insult filter.

274
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,800
I just want to protect you.

275
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
You aren't my dad.

276
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,500
You don't have to provide a safe growing environment for me.

277
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't want you to be upset.

278
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
If you insist on being a bird of joy, I'll be upset.

279
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm not an egg that needs to be kept safe in the nest.

280
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm not that weak.

281
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,600
We have to fight together. Right?

282
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Share all information and burdens.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,300
Got it?

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah, I do.

285
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Do you really understand?

286
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,899
Have you told me everything?

287
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
- Yes, I have.
- Really?

288
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
Yes, really.

289
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Besides, I didn't do this on purpose.

290
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Fine.

291
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Let me flick your forehead.

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
I'll forgive you after that.

293
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
Come on. I'm sure you won't hit me hard.

294
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,500
Thank you. Kind and pretty lady.

295
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,600
That's right.

296
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,100
I have such a charming characteristic. Oh, dear.

297
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,400
It's late. I have to go back and rest.

298
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Don't leave. Enjoy your time with me.

299
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
What will we do?

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,300
Have a good rest so you'll be rejuvenated.

301
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,600
Good night.

302
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:21,101
Hey! Don't leave!

303
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,579
Wait for me! Let me put on some clothes!

304
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
Hongdou! Hongdou!

305
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,600
Sister Manjun.

306
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,500
Xiaochun, you're here.

307
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Aunty A'Gui said you're running out of cleaning products.

308
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,600
I brought some over.

309
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you going to the farm again?

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,300
You've planted so many trees,

311
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
but you aren't staying here for long.

312
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,600
When you leave, what's going to happen to those trees?

313
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,500
I rented that farm for five years.

314
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,600
The landlord agreed to take care of the trees after I leave.

315
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,400
That's good.

316
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,800
Sister Manjun.

317
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Look. You've been here for a long time.

318
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,600
I didn't ask you about this before,

319
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,200
but why did you and your husband divorce?

320
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Did he cheat on you?

321
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
No, he didn't.

322
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,300
Did you cheat on him?

323
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,800
Did you divorce your husband because someone had an affair?

324
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,500
That's not it.

325
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,000
We weren't a good match

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and didn't get along well.

327
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,800
We got married right after graduation from university.

328
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
We weren't mature enough

329
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
when we had a baby.

330
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,500
We were so busy

331
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,600
after we had Xiao Hu Lu.

332
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,900
At that time, he had a stable job.

333
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,800
His wages were around ¥3,000 a month.

334
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,300
He was persuaded by a former classmate

335
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,200
that selling water purifiers could earn a lot.

336
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,700
That friend had made quite a fortune.

337
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,400
So, he didn't discuss it with me before resigning from his job.

338
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
He went to sell water purifiers after that.

339
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,400
To be honest,

340
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,900
he's not made to be a salesman.

341
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,800
God knows what he was thinking.

342
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,300
At first,

343
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,400
our relatives and friends would buy from him out of courtesy.

344
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,600
He made some money back then.

345
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
However, once everyone bought from him,

346
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,300
they wouldn't need to buy another one.

347
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,000
He had to look for new customers.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
At that time,

349
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,000
I had just given birth to Xiao Hu Lu.

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
I didn't have enough sleep every day.

351
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,300
I even had to take care of her alone.

352
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,800
So, my mood wasn't great.

353
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,400
I was under great pressure.

354
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,300
In order to sell more purifiers, he always had to drink with customers.

355
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,600
He'd come home drunk all the time.

356
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,800
I had to take care of him, too.

357
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
- Are you still upset with him now?
- Yeah.

358
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
How about you?

359
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Don't you?

360
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,000
My ex-husband and I were a rather traditional couple.

361
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,600
He was the breadwinner while I took care of the family.

362
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,100
For many years, we barely quarelled.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,400
He respected me, and I cared for him.

364
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,800
When he started to run his own business, it was tough.

365
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
He worked day and night.

366
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
In our 20-years of marriage,

367
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,600
he realized all his promises to me.

368
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,100
We had a happy life.

369
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,300
Isn't that good?

370
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,400
Why did you divorce?

371
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,900
When my daughter was a freshman in high school,

372
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,100
he was transferred to be the manager of a branch office.

373
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,800
That new office was very far from our home,

374
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,500
so we bought an apartment near the new office.

375
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,200
He lived there on weekdays

376
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,800
and came home once a week.

377
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,000
There was a camera in that apartment.

378
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,800
I could see what he was doing on my phone.

379
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,500
What did he do?

380
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
He did nothing.

381
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,300
He lied on the couch every day,

382
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,900
had chips, drank beer,

383
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,000
and played games on a large television with his phone.

384
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Suddenly,

385
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,500
I felt that our lives were completely separate

386
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,600
even though we were a couple.

387
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,500
I was jealous of him.

388
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,400
For many years, I've been like this aqua Bonsai.

389
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,400
I constantly envied the trees out there.

390
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,800
I wanted to be planted in real soil.

391
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,000
I yearned to grow up to be a tree.

392
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,440
One, two, three, four.

393
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,760
Three.

394
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,999
- Stop there. Stop!
- Stop working!

395
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,019
Don't move!

396
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,760
Stop!

397
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,260
Follow me.

398
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,940
- Everyone, stop working!
<i>- Stop! I told you to stop!</i>

399
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,660
<i>Stop right now!</i>

400
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,739
<i>Who's in charge?</i>

401
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,899
I am the owner.

402
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,560
Nice to meet you. What's the problem?

403
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,320
Are you Xie Zhiyao's girlfriend?

404
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,820
Yes, you can call me Xu Hongdou.

405
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,480
Why did you make them stop working?

406
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,419
You wealthy folks are unscrupulous.

407
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,779
If you stop us from working, we won't let you continue.

408
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,119
- Am I right?
- <i>Yes!</i>

409
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,939
Sir, you came out of nowhere and asked us to stop.

410
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,280
I don't know what's going on either.

411
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,579
How about we talk this through?

412
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,539
I'll resolve any issues that I'm responsible for.

413
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,259
Otherwise, we can go to the village committee.

414
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,499
We won't go there!

415
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,939
I bet you bribed them to side with you.

416
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,859
What bribes can we offer?

417
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,219
Can you prove that?

418
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,159
You wouldn't have left any evidence, but I saw everything.

419
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,259
Xie Zhiyao found new investors!

420
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,000
Playing with fire? An all-round development?

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,779
- We can't let them continue!
- <i>No, we can't!</i>

422
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,200
Don't bully her!

423
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,860
You want profits, but we want money too!

424
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,320
Xiao Hu Lu, what should we do?

425
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,659
Let's split up.

426
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,879
Huzi and I will go to Uncle's house and ask him to help.

427
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,659
You go to the village committee for help.

428
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,779
Who do I look for?

429
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,239
Sister Xinxin. Anyone else is fine.

430
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:01,759
- Ask them to come and help.
- Okay.

431
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>Granny! Granny!</i>

432
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,480
What happened? What's going on?

433
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,699
What's going on?

434
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:21,279
Granny, is Uncle at home? We have to save Sister Hongdou.

435
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,480
What's going on?

436
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,659
Uncle Li Zihao took so many people to Sister Hongdou's place and stopped them from working.

437
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,739
They looked so fierce, like they wanted to beat people up!

438
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,200
Beat people?

439
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,379
How many of them were there?

440
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,179
So many of them with hoes and spades!

441
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,660
We have to find my uncle!

442
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,539
I'm going to borrow this.

443
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,880
I'll help her.

444
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,679
If we can't work, you can't either.

445
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,680
How can you dominate everything?

446
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,499
I don't know who you heard this from,

447
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,859
but you can't resolve anything by throwing a fuss here.

448
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,659
If you don't believe me, go to the village committee

449
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,639
and speak with the secretary or the village director.

450
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:06,840
Xie Zhiyao doesn't have such overwhelming power to stop you from making money.

451
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,259
Don't feign ignorance and lie to us.

452
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,499
We heard that the boss only invested in your business!

453
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,619
Job opportunities? That's bullshit!

454
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,379
He just wants the villagers to work for him and make money.

455
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:19,539
He wants to be the boss of us all!

456
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,179
Yeah, he wants to monopolize the profits!

457
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,340
Why is he allowed to earn money?

458
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,219
Well, fine.

459
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,779
We'll stop work for today, all right?

460
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,979
Let's go to the village committee.

461
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,880
There's no one in the office.

462
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,480
No one?

463
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,100
Xie Zhiyao isn't around either.

464
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,639
What exactly do you want? Tell me.

465
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,619
What do we want? We want an explanation.

466
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,540
We aren't idiots.

467
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,060
See that? The camera is on.

468
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,740
Whatever you say now is evidence.

469
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm doing a legal and reasonable business.

470
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,440
If you have objections, call the police.

471
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,579
Bring it to court and appeal for an investigation.

472
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,659
Feel free to do that.

473
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,859
But if you disrupt our work right now, you'll be deemed as rioters.

474
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,219
Rioters?

475
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,060
Shameless. Putting blame on the victims now?

476
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,699
Yes, we're here to raise a riot. So what?

477
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,540
Demolish the place! Do it!

478
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,300
Wait a second. Calm down.

479
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,660
Stop, don't do it!

480
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,460
Who's here?

481
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,539
What are you doing?

482
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,719
What are you doing? What are you doing?

483
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,539
Who's messing around?

484
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,060
Who's doing this?

485
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,499
A'Yao isn't home, so you're taking the chance to bully Hongdou?

486
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,880
Do you think I'm dead?

487
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,760
Who is it? Who's the leader?

488
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,280
Who organized this?

489
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,720
Who is it? Spit it out.

490
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,580
I'm the one.

491
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,080
Granny Xie, we have no other choice.

492
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,219
Your dear grandson is cutting off our profits.

493
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,920
Nonsense! Utter rubbish!

494
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,440
- Did you lose any money?
- Calm down!

495
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,379
Are you dirt poor?

496
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,900
Don't think we won't hit you because you're old!

497
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,140
How dare you? I'll beat you!

498
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,019
Do it! Come on!

499
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,059
I'll retaliate! I will!

500
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,619
Do it!

501
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,839
How dare you stay here! Scram!

502
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,800
I'll leave! I'm leaving!

503
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,859
Are you okay?

504
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm fine.

505
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,600
How dare they cause trouble for me!

506
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,700
Does it hurt?

507
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,280
Don't be angry.

508
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,839
You've already beat them off. You even hurt your hand.

509
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,360
It's all because A'Yao isn't around.

510
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,060
That's why they bullied you today.

511
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,760
You've already beaten them up for me.

512
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,240
This isn't over.

513
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,539
I need an explanation from the village committee tomorrow.

514
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,600
They can't just trample over others like this.

515
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,519
Exactly.

516
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,379
They should be punished and made to apologize.

517
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,360
That's right.

518
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,059
Here. I'll tend to that.

519
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,180
<i>Hongdou!</i>

520
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,540
<i>Granny!</i>

521
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,539
Are you all right?

522
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,779
We're fine. Don't worry.

523
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,640
Have you called Brother?

524
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Nope. He left with Daxia to check the products.

525
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,339
I don't want them to rush back.

526
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,360
I'll tell him tomorrow.

527
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,920
Granny.

528
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,240
- Did you get hurt? Did they hit you?
- Nope.

529
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,359
Granny beat them with the toy sword and scratched her hand.

530
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,440
Return the toy sword to Huzi tomorrow.

531
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,739
You should've seen her.

532
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,480
She was so cool when she protected me with the sword.

533
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,239
Cool?

534
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,579
You scared me to death.

535
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,919
Brother isn't home right now. If you two got hurt, he'd lose his mind when he got back!

536
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,140
Xu Hongdou!

537
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,680
She isn't in.

538
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,640
She left early today.

539
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,220
She went out?

540
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,680
I heard she went horse riding.

541
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,800
Horse riding?

542
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,979
Granny! You should've told me if she took Cutie Pie with her.

543
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,659
You didn't ask me.

544
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,859
Where did she go?

545
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,600
No clue.

546
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,299
I didn't expect you to come back early.

547
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,779
You can call her.

548
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,939
She isn't picking up!

549
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,020
Well, wait for her at home.

550
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Xu Hongdou.

551
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,820
It's dangerous for you to ride a horse alone.

552
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,860
What if you fall? You'll get seriously hurt.

553
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,699
Why did you come back so early?

554
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,620
I rushed back at 4:00 a.m.

555
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,780
You should've told me that you were in trouble.

556
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,240
I would've dashed back last night.

557
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,680
I told Xiaochun not to tell you.

558
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,419
Who called you?

559
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,920
Ye Sen.

560
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,279
I'm sorry. You were implicated because of me.

561
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,379
It must've been hard on you.

562
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,160
I'm really, really sorry!

563
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,019
The incident yesterday was indeed your fault.

564
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,140
Yes. Absolutely. I... I didn't handle it well.

565
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,360
I didn't mean that.

566
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,200
Do you remember your promise a few days ago?

567
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,080
You said you won't hide anything from me.

568
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,680
We'd share all information and fight together.

569
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,340
Isn't that right?

570
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,400
Yes.

571
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,860
Why didn't you tell me

572
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,870
about the investment and all-around development plan?

573
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,899
That's a little complex.

574
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,139
It might not work out.

575
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,400
I didn't want you to feel disappointed, so I kept quiet.

576
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,439
The secretary had a meeting in town yesterday to discuss this matter.

577
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,480
Didn't want me to be disappointed?

578
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,460
They proposed a tempting offer.

579
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,619
If our village is developed, the villagers can earn quite a bit just from rent.

580
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,080
There'll be more job opportunities and it'll benefit your business.

581
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,619
I can earn even more as well.

582
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,960
We'll have more chances in the future, too.

583
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,760
However, if we agree,

584
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,179
our village will be like a car with just the accelerator but no brakes.

585
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:38,439
A crash will kill everyone or we can only stop when we're worn out.

586
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,839
This isn't in line with the local development initiative.

587
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,879
So, I wanted to wait for the village committee's decision before making up my mind.

588
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,040
Xie Zhiyao,

589
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,040
do you really think I'm here... for your money?

590
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,580
Of course not.

591
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,759
In your eyes, I'm just a money-grubber.

592
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,999
I care about nothing else but money. Is that it?

593
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,360
You think I'll be elated over the investment...

594
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,140
and hope you accept it.

595
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,780
After all, I wasn't born here.

596
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,280
I have no attachments to this place.

597
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,699
When the village is drained of its resources,

598
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,899
I'll find another Yunmiao Village

599
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,100
and suck them dry like a leech.

600
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,660
Is that it?

601
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,220
That's not what I think.

602
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,739
Regardless, I'm at fault. I'm sorry.

603
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,280
Please don't be angry, all right?

604
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,540
You've always looked down on me, haven't you?

605
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,339
You think I'm a girlfriend to be charmed with sweet nothings. Right?

606
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,579
Whatever happens, you always apologize first.

607
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,280
You try to make amends.

608
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,040
Hold on.

609
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,219
What's wrong with my apology? What's wrong with being nice?

610
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,299
All right, fine.

611
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,219
I'm in the wrong.

612
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,499
I'll stand here and await punishment.

613
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,760
You're absolutely right.

614
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,380
Let's just... take a break to cool our heads.

615
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,600
Hongdou.

616
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,460
- Xu Hongdou!
- I don't want to talk to you.

617
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,800
Granny,

618
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,020
are you going to set up your stall?

619
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,019
Take a break today.

620
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,739
Can you help out at Hongdou's construction site?

621
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,859
Why don't you go there?

622
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,379
I have to look for those guys and stop them from heading over.

623
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,139
Why are you doing that alone?

624
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,779
You should report this to the village committee. Let them resolve this.

625
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:24,359
No, I can't. I have to do this alone.

626
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,419
You're fuming with anger now.

627
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,900
You'll just end up in a fight with them.

628
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,400
I have good odds of winning in a fight.

629
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,840
Sit down.

630
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,360
Did you quarrel with Hongdou?

631
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,279
She said I looked down on her.

632
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,439
I spoiled her and overprotected her.

633
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:52,459
Why can't I be nice to her? What am I supposed to do?

634
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,560
Your strategies to pacify me aren't working on her.

635
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,459
Hey, what do you mean by strategies?

636
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,300
You make me sound like a pretentious and scheming guy.

637
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,379
Do you think I'm too old to have a clear mind?

638
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,540
Am I to be cared for like a baby?

639
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,819
Do you think I'm muddled so you don't have to reason with me?

640
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:18,310
You just have to coax me, don't you?

641
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,310
You assume you're doing things for my benefit,

642
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,370
so I have to go along with your decisions.

643
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,440
If I oppose, I'm a troublemaker.

644
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,720
To be honest, I'm not dumb.

645
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,699
I go along with your decisions because that'll make you happy.

646
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,939
You're trying to make me happy?

647
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,099
Of course.

648
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,280
You're my grandson.

649
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't want to bicker with you.

650
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,680
Let's go. Take me to the stall.

651
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,779
That's not it, Granny.

652
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,099
Help watch over Hongdou!

653
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,859
Why should I do that?

654
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,859
Will daily life be over because of a small problem?

655
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,500
Get moving.

656
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,540
You're deaf to my words now, aren't you?

657
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,160
Chairman Xie!

658
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,240
Granny!

659
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,920
What's going on?

660
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,019
The village director got me to calm you down.

661
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,259
Don't lead men over and blow things up.

662
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,159
He said he'd resolve this.

663
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,199
That won't do. I have to resolve this on my own.

664
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,939
Don't throw tantrums!

665
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,580
You can't resolve this just by venting your anger.

666
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,779
Think carefully.

667
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,999
Hongdou has to continue running her business here.

668
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:36,659
She's always saying that peace brings prosperity.

669
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,360
Can't you see the bigger picture?

670
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,419
He's so mad now he's lost his head.

671
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,970
Listen to Xiao Huang.

672
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,160
Consider Hongdou's situation.

673
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,459
Well, they have to apologize to Hongdou.

674
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,759
Fine, an apology. They'll do so.

675
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:55,499
Great. Let's set up the stall.

676
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,780
Move it.

677
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,739
Let's go.

678
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,120
Come on.

679
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,260
Granny, be careful.

680
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,680
Come on.

681
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
Granny, lock the door.

682
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,760
Grandpa Yang.

683
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,280
Why... are you here?

684
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,880
It's nothing.

685
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,260
I-I'll get you a cup of tea.

686
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,420
Sure.

687
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,459
<i>The coffee ingredients are in higher demand now</i>

688
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,500
<i>because it's in season.</i>

689
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,939
<i>The same for desserts.</i>

690
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,879
<i>This month has more holidays, so we need to prepare more.</i>

691
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,180
<i>That's right. When I visit the supplier again,</i>

692
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,759
<i>- I'll order more dessert ingredients.
- Okay.</i>

693
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:01,700
<i>Look here.</i>

694
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,460
Hello.

695
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,699
You're Xiao Hu Lu. Am I right?

696
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,099
Do you know me?

697
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,380
Of course, I do.

698
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,120
Xiao Hu Lu is the only girl among the four of you.

699
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,960
I know you, too.

700
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,700
You're Guobao.

701
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,279
I can't identify Huzi and Tuotuo between you two.

702
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:56,500
I'm Tuotuo, and he's Huzi.

703
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,560
So, you're Tuotuo.

704
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,680
Who are you?

705
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,080
I'm sure you've heard of me.

706
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,460
If I tell you, you'll get scared.

707
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,499
Why would we be scared of you?

708
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,659
Are you a child trafficker?

709
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,899
We won't eat your snacks or leave with you.

710
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,419
We aren't scared of you.

711
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,419
My mom and uncle are in there.

712
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,420
If I shout, they'll come out and beat you up.

713
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,540
Well done.

714
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,740
That's what you should do.

715
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,140
Xie Qiang!

716
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,660
Come up.

717
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,040
Have fun.

718
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,679
- Brother.
- Xiaochun.

719
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,499
Xie Qiang?

720
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,100
He's Xie Qiang.

721
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,620
Why are you running?

722
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,900
- A'Yao.
- Good to see you.

723
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,659
What do you want to drink? Coffee or tea?

724
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,819
I don't need a drink. I'm not thirsty.

725
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,900
I'll get you some water.

726
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,480
I went to your horse ranch.

727
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,000
It's terrific.

728
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,599
Every time I invited you to my house, you refused to come over.

729
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,859
I had to fertilize the orchard, so I didn't have time.

730
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,440
- Take a seat.
- I don't have to.

731
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,179
Make yourself at home. Just sit down.

732
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,740
Sit.

733
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,979
You've gotten quite tan after being back for a few days,

734
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,480
but you look quite cheerful.

735
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,780
A'Yao.

736
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,579
Look. The smartphone you gave me is so advanced.

737
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm clueless about most functions.

738
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,539
You're wasting it on me.

739
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,120
Take your time to learn.

740
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,120
You have to learn and adapt to new and good things.

741
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,000
What's wrong?

742
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,739
Don't be shy with me.

743
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,540
Just tell me.

744
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,400
A'Yao,

745
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,560
my... parents are getting old now.

746
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,720
I don't want to work away from home.

747
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,240
When I was in prison, I'd thought things through.

748
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,239
My wages don't matter as long as it's enough for my family.

749
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,339
So... I want to ask you for a favor.

750
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,860
If you need any labor workers,

751
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,880
can you hire me?

752
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,240
I can carry bricks and packages.

753
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,900
In addition to working in the fields, I want to do some part-time jobs.

754
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,520
No problem.

755
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,900
It's nice... to work in the village.

756
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,980
But the village is small, and people find it boring.

757
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,840
So, they enjoy gossiping about others.

758
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,399
They don't harbor ill intentions. They're just killing time.

759
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:06,539
Don't take any of that to heart.

760
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,420
They'll stop once they get bored of it.

761
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm fine.

762
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,980
It's just... my mom will be worried.

763
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,659
Don't worry about Aunty Feng.

764
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,019
She's been through a lot.

765
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,500
Such trivial matters don't bother her.

766
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,220
That's true.

767
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,000
By the way, how's your girlfriend?

768
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,840
I heard from my mom after I came home last night.

769
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,380
She's fine.

770
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,660
Just some misunderstandings and gossip.

771
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,100
A'Yao, you face so many problems every day.

772
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,160
Life must be tough.

773
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,640
Nothing is easy.

774
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,139
It's hard to keep a career.

775
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,180
It's hard to maintain a relationship.

776
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,980
Nothing is easy.

777
