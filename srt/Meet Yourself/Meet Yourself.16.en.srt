<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,796
Aunty A'Gui, are you done with your chores?

4
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,780
Coming! All you do is hurry me.

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,412
Always asking me to hurry up.

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,180
Why is the table in a mess again?

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,540
Remember to clean it up.

8
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,500
Okay.

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,660
What's this?

10
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,660
Don't touch it. It's expensive.

11
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,760
Come on, Aunty A'Gui. Please have a seat.

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Aunty A'Gui. Mare's milk.

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,244
Mare's milk?

14
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:03,360
Did you get it from A'Yao's horse ranch?

15
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,060
Bingo.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm aiming for a limited edition series.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,680
I brewed this cup just for you.

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Have a taste.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
This is golden silk black tea.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm using this as a tea base to pair with mare's milk.

21
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,952
Based on my understanding of you,

22
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,880
I'll brew a special cup of milk tea

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,908
with my ideal golden ratio.

24
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,956
What an honor.

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,080
- Have a taste.
- Okay.

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,360
Mr. Ma, I'm done.

27
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,100
Personally, I like green plum tea the most.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,240
It has a milder taste than the sourness of lemons,

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,484
so I gave it a nine out of ten.

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,520
But this is based on my personal preference.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,860
I don't know much about tea.

32
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,620
It's right to trust your feelings.

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,100
The most important aspect is to suit your taste.

34
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,980
Why do customers come to the store?

35
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,900
They want to enjoy the service.

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,464
Of course, they can come once or twice for the novelty.

37
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,380
But what keeps customers?

38
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,980
It's the product.

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Hongdou,

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,784
are you sure you don't like milk tea?

41
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,100
I not particularly fond of it.

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,612
I prefer pure tea over other drinks.

43
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,520
Milk tea is just too expensive, isn't it?

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,140
It could easily cost ¥20 to ¥30 per cup.

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,820
Gosh. How much is a cup?

46
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,980
Around ¥30.

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,680
¥30?

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
Just for a small cup like this?

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
No, that's not it.

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
This is a limited-edition drink.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,480
The price of this would be more than ¥30.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,640
Why is it so expensive?

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,684
Is there gold in it?

54
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,180
Aunty A'Gui.

55
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Actually, this is a fabulous idea.

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,856
I can consider adding gold leaves to them,

57
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:07,360
but I'll have to revise the prices again.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,684
Mr. Ma, I reckon you should quit selling milk tea.

59
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,420
Just rob people on the streets.

60
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,200
You'll get the money faster.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,640
I slave from morning to night daily for just ¥50,

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,724
but you're charging ¥30 for just a cup of milk tea.

63
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,728
I'd never buy it.

64
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,428
Aunty A'Gui, here's the thing.

65
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,796
The milk tea isn't expensive,

66
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:35,920
but I have to cover the costs of the rent, utility bills,

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,260
and manpower in the price.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,268
Let me ask you this.

69
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:44,496
Where will you find so many suckers willing to throw money at you?

70
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,640
Hold on.

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,940
Aunty A'Gui, you can't call them suckers.

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,040
- People have consumption needs.
- Yes.

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,021
Look. A cup of milk tea costs ¥20 to ¥30.

74
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,040
It's an affordable price for ordinary customers to enjoy once in a while.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,044
However, it's a hefty expense if someone drinks them daily.

76
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:06,664
That's true, but we have a membership card.

77
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:08,360
But there are people like me.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,360
The consumer trap of bragging about a gift of milk tea in autumn doesn't work on us.

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,520
We're the minority.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
Mr. Ma, you can ignore me.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
Of course. If the shop has a nice environment,

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
good service, and a distinctive vibe,

83
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,600
your store will be my first choice for a business meeting.

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,268
After all, tons of people want to support domestic brands now.

85
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:32,920
Hongdou, you're offering great help,

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,176
especially in terms of product promotion

87
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:39,868
and increasing customer retention.

88
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:44,308
We haven't done enough consumer research.

89
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,630
I'm glad I could be of help.

90
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,980
That's payment for your tea.

91
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,360
You can enjoy free tea on me at any time.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,916
If I were you,

93
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,720
I'd buy milk from the supermarket and brew my own black tea at home.

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,932
That's the same, isn't it?

95
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:03,420
I'd never fall for your tricks.

96
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,240
He specializes in swindling rich people of their money.

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,501
Don't say that. This isn't a scam.

98
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,828
This is a business,

99
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,724
and businesses have their respective consumer groups.

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,044
Yes, certainly. Hongdou's right.

101
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:26,480
Am I being a nuisance here?

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,300
Look. Mr. Ma is treating me to his expensive milk tea,

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,200
but I said such unpleasant things.

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

105
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,340
It's nothing.

106
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,000
I should learn from the mynas.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Whenever I see you, I'll say, "May wealth shower upon you! Delicious!"

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Please don't.

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,080
Aunty A'Gui, you have to stay true to who you are.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,412
Do you know why I like and adore you?

111
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:58,196
It's because of your unfaltering honesty.

112
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,760
You always speak your mind.

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,980
You're frank and outspoken.

114
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,540
I love you to bits.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,440
What a glib talker.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,020
All he does is flatter me.

117
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,840
Just one utterance tells me you aren't a decent man.

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
All right, enough.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
I still have unfinished chores.

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,040
I don't have time to chat with you.

121
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,932
This tastes pretty good.

122
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:24,280
- I'm off.
- Okay.

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,760
Come here for more once you're done.

124
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,440
Damai, aren't you done typing yet?

125
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Almost done.

126
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,624
Are you writing your graduation thesis?

127
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,820
Look at this. Let me take a look.

128
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,000
Damai, are you writing a novel about tea leaves?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,952
What's this about the taboo love

130
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:02,360
between soy milk and Pu'er tea?

131
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,680
Damai, this is great.

132
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
What?

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,560
Can you write a story for me?

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,460
Nope.

135
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a very simple story.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,680
Let's personify soy milk and make a comic—

137
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I mean you need to pay me.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,560
We're adults.

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,880
There's no such thing as a free story,

140
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,780
but I can give you a discount.

141
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,000
You startled me.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
- Isn't it just money? Name your price.
- Deal.

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,300
I look forward to working with you!

144
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll write it right away.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,748
Hello? My parcel?

146
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:49,340
Just leave it at the collection kiosk.

147
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,040
Okay, thank you.

148
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm going to pick up my parcel.

149
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Go ahead.

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,260
<i>Master, hit me again.</i>

151
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,932
<i>Let's go!</i>

152
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,120
<i>Master! Master!</i>

153
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,080
<i>What?</i>

154
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,060
<i>What are you carving?</i>

155
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,120
<i>Don't you have eyes?</i>

156
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,004
<i>We're customizing this wooden lotus carving for a hotel.</i>

157
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,700
<i>Check out my master's skills.</i>

158
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,768
<i>Intricate. Pure art.</i>

159
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:48,792
<i>Why don't you do your work instead of fawning over me?</i>

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
<i>[Hahaha! Master is shy!]
Stop filming me!</i>

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,220
<i>[Master is so fierce]
Film yourself! Goodness.</i>

162
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,800
<i>Master, the fans want to see you.</i>

163
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,920
<i>[Xia Xia is on the brink of getting walloped]
They think you're impressive.</i>

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>They think I'm impressive?</i>

165
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
<i>[Master is so focused]

<i>I don't want it.</i>

169
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,588
<i>Master, give me your hand.</i>

170
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,680
<i>What is it?</i>

171
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>Darned brat! Stop there!</i>

172
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,520
<i>- Run!
- Stop!</i>

173
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,240

174
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,960

176
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,436
I love this "Master, Hit Me Again" series.

177
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,820
The series, "Senior, Teach Me," was also pretty good.

178
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,840
It's really hilarious to watch your master wallop you.

179
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
My master really hits me.

180
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,180
It hurts.

181
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,320
Take it easy with the coffee. It's late in the afternoon.

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,440
You won't be able to sleep at night.

183
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,320
I still need to work tonight.

184
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,840
When have you been this diligent?

185
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,860
My master got me more jobs for more practice.

186
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,940
I'll set a good example for my juniors.

187
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,880
Our Xia Xia is a sensible boy now. You're all grown up.

188
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,620
Stop it.

189
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,840
Why do you look so pleased?

190
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Because I have someone picking me up, too.

191
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,880
Be honest.

192
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,480
You're a homebody, but you insist on picking me up from work.

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Are you sure you aren't forcing yourself to do this?

194
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,204
I... I know sitting for too long is bad for my health.

195
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,620
I'm experienced with that.

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,248
When your life is plagued with agony,

197
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,712
only negative thoughts occupy your mind all the time.

198
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:00,600
It does nothing in resolving problems.

199
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,668
At such moments, as long as we take a stroll outside,

200
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,604
chat with others,

201
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,760
breathe in the fresh air,

202
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,000
bask in the sun,

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,936
and enjoy delicious food,

204
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:16,000
we'll slowly feel rejuvenated.

205
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,020
I'll listen to your advice.

206
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,640
I'll come out more often, bask in the sun, and enjoy good food.

207
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,580
Okay.

208
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,840
Well, what are we having for dinner tonight?

209
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,680
What would you like to eat? I'll cook for you.

210
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,460
Let me think.

211
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,860
- Uncle.
- A'Yao.

212
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,948
Is she still asleep?

213
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,640
Xu Hongdou!

214
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,380
Were you woken up by the birds?

215
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,760
Dad, are you going to fetch water?

216
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,472
She's a tenant in the courtyard.

217
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,500
I can see that.

218
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Blackie.

219
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,780
Blackie.

220
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,384
Jiahui.

221
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
What are you eating?

222
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,080
Uncle!

223
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
You're back!

224
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
Xiao Hu.

225
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,200
Hello, Uncle.

226
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,436
When did you come back?

227
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,360
It's the death anniversary of A'Yao's grandpa. I came to sweep his tomb.

228
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,980
- Are things going well at home?
- yes.

229
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,480
Has A'Yuan been well-behaved lately?

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,340
Yes.

231
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,060
He's started to study.

232
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,440
That's great.

233
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,280
A while back, Chairman Xie was worried sick about him.

234
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,612
- Teenage boys are—
- How's your new song coming along?

235
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,040
Uncle, I haven't written any songs lately.

236
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,800
Once I write a new one, I'll send it to you immediately.

237
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,100
You can listen to it and perk up while you're out on deliveries.

238
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,440
No, thanks.

239
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,500
We don't listen to such whining when delivering goods.

240
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,940
Can't you write something like Phoenix Legend's songs?

241
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,492
That'll pump me up!

242
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
We don't work with the same genre, Uncle.

243
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,800
You can change your style.

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,320
Write songs that common folks like us would enjoy.

245
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,420
Such as...

246
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,580
♪ <i>I swim like a fish in a pond</i> ♪

247

That one. That's so uplifting.

248
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:37,680
A'Yuan's mom spends two hours with that daily.

249
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,300
She has so much fun.

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,640
Those songs are great.

251
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,080
Got it, Uncle. I... I'll try my best.

252
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay. Give your all.

253
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,660
I'll leave you to your day.

254
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,480
- Goodbye, Uncle.
- Get on with your work.

255
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,820
Take care, Uncle.

Huzi's parents! Are you going back to Guangzhou?

258
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,900
Yeah, things are busy in the factory.

259
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,820
The boss called and urged us to go back.

260
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,980
It's good to be busy.

261
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,720
They're charged per piece of clothing.

262
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,676
More work means more money.

263
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,236
Where are you two headed?

264
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,780
We're going to pick someone up.

Don't worry, I have money.

My dad and mom are leaving in a few days.

They give me pocket money every day.

they bring you so much good food and toys.

Ask Uncle A'Yao to convince him to earn more money outside this town.

283
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,320
Uncle won't do that.

284

He wants everyone from the village to return.

285

I'd love to, but what can I even do there?

299
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,960
- Take care of yourself, Mom.
- You too.

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,800
Don't overwork yourself. Get more rest.

329
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,680
It's okay. All right. It's okay.

330
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,516
I'll take you to feed the horses, all right?

331
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,540
I'll buy you popsicles, all right?

332
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,500
Don't cry.

333
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,412
There, there.

334
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,580
It's okay. Aunty Hua, it's okay.

335
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,260
♫ <i>When the wind rises, the sky will be cloudless</i> ♫

336
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,520
♫ <i>I'll head to a windy place to meet you</i> ♫

337
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,320
There, there.

338
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,320
I'll take you to feed the horses and buy you popsicles.

339
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,740
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you Sunzi and Xiao Fang?

340
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,000
- Yes, hello. I'm Sunzi.
- Hello, I'm Xu Hongdou.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,920
Huang Xinxin's in a meeting. She asked Chairman Xie and me to pick you up.

342
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,300
Chairman... That's Chairman Xie.

343
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,100
Uncle Siping is here.

344
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,000
- The old man is here?
- Is it too late to flee?

345
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
Aunty, are you busy?

346
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,180
Gezi!

347
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,120
Uncle, you're here.

348
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,060
Ye Sen, I've been looking for you.

349
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,084
I just took a look around your little warehouse.

350
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,120
Xiaoyue said you have a day off today.

351
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,820
Yes.

352
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,660
Are you out having fun?

353
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,800
Gezi asked me to help her. Colleagues should help each other.

354
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,360
Yes, I asked him to help me.

355
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,976
Well, you can get on with your work.

356
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,748
Uncle, how can we help you?

357
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:27,400
I just want to have a casual chat.

358
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,080
Don't mind me.

359
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,200
A'Yao's helping Heshun renovate the wood carving workshop and promote it.

360
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,300
Is it for free?

361
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,120
Why are you eyeing him?

362
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,900
Your handicraft website is also selling wood carvings from the wood carving workshop, right?

363
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,740
Is A'Yao just helping them,

364
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,920
or is he receiving a share of the money?

365
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,360
Ye Sen, Uncle's asking you a question.

366
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,540
Don't ask me. My leg hurts.

367
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,340
It doesn't.

368
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,004
You can't possibly be clueless.

369
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,800
Ye Sen, you designed the website.

370
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,740
Gezi, you were the one who posted the products. Right?

371
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,196
Well... I guess...

372
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,820
he's helping them.

373
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,816
That seems right.

374
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,180
He's helping them.

375
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,533
So, he's free labor for Heshun.

376
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,060
I'll let you get on with your work.

377
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,240
Goodbye, Uncle.

378
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,780
- Aunty, I'm leaving.
- See you.

379
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank goodness he's gone.

380
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,540
Let's get to work so we can eat sooner.

381
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,780
We sparked a new problem again.

382
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,156
<i>[To Freedom]</i>

383
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,360
Try it.

384
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,660
Nice.

385
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,340
This is more like it.

386
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
When you have nothing to do,

387
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,296
come out for some sunlight.

388
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,900
Doesn't this feel great?

389
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,984
It's beneficial to your writing as well.

390
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
One more thing.

391
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,820
When you're free, spend more time chatting with me.

392
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,252
That's beneficial to a song composition.

393
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
The wind has risen.

394
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,200
I just came up with some lyrics.

395
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,328
♪ <i>Blow, blow it away</i> ♪

396
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,428
Why is he back again?

397
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:21,980
Who is it?

398
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,264
Phoenix Legend's fan.

399
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:26,680
Chairman Xie's father.

400
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,268
Be careful of him.

401
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm going to hide in my room.

402
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm leaving.

403
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,740
Be careful.

404
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,640
Who are you looking for?

405
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,980
You must be Xu Hongdou, right?

406
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes, I am.

407
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,168
I'm Xie Zhiyao's dad.

408
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,740
Uncle Xie? Hello.

409
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,580
Don't stand. Stay seated.

410
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,460
Sit down. Sit.

411
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,120
Bye-bye.

412
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,752
Is A'Yuan doing well in school?

413
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:40,200
He's studying hard now.

414
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,900
Really?

415
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,688
That's great.

416
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,840
This courtyard is really well decorated.

417
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,020
Yeah.

418
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,176
Aunty A'Gui's very attentive.

419
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,760
Have you gotten used to living here?

420
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,260
I have.

421
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,580
One ore two months here is fine,

422
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,928
but you'll miss Beijing as time passes.

423
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Perhaps.

424
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,004
Do you have something to say to me?

425
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,140
I just happened to see you and came over for a chat.

426
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,600
Sure.

427
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,480
I heard A'Yao's granny say that

428
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,116
A'Yao is all ears to anything you say.

429
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,800
Hold on.

430
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,120
This is probably a misunderstanding.

431
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,328
Both of us only speak about the cafe.

432
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:39,520
That's perfect.

433
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,540
I'm talking about the cafe.

434
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,752
Could you give me some suggestions?

435
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,044
Sure, go ahead.

436
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,740
Look. Yunmiao is in the countryside.

437
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,496
Youngsters who excel at their studies leave for the cities.

438
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:58,476
Those who can't study but are quick-witted

439
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,844
buy a car to start a business

440
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:07,060
in crowded spots like Shuanglang, Xizhou, or the Old Town.

441
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,420
Even if we holler our throats dry in a small place like Yunmiao,

442
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,280
only a handful of people will hear us.

443
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,740
That's very logical.

444
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,620
But here's my opinion, we can't make such generalizations.

445
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,180
Before those places were developed,

446
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,260
they were also small fishing villages and old towns. Right?

447
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,560
Yeah.

448
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,728
It's the same with wholesale flowers at the market.

449
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:32,720
Initially, there were few people in the business.

450
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,580
A small shop can easily grow.

451
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,800
Once the shop flourishes, there'll be more purchases and customers.

452
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,620
If there's a good supply flow, flower suppliers will be willing...

453
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,100
to offer rare flowers and the best flowers at the best price.

454
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,880
With a big shop,

455
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,500
there'll be better sales and more customers to bring more profits. The shop will continue expanding.

456
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,380
How can small shops that just started out compete with such known shops?

457
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,800
You're absolutely right.

458
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,080
- Aren't I?
- But here's what I think.

459
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,080
This comparison isn't all.

460
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,100
Shops may stock the same items,

461
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,520
but tourist spots offer different scenery in each place.

462
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't you agree?

463
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,640
Fine.

464
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,360
I won't make such a comparison.

465
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,540
Let's talk about something else. Look at A'Yao.

466
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,040
Back then,

467
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,040
his mom left this place to work so that he could study.

468
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,688
It was so that he could leave this small village and escape poverty.

469
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,100
A'Yao lived up to our expectations and entered a college in Beijing.

470
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,660
He got a good job in Beijing that paid him well,

471
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,400
but he insisted on coming back.

472
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:44,580
He invested all the money he earned here and even ended up with loans.

473
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,580
He's just been shoving money down a rabbit hole for years.

474
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,300
Some buses travel through town, but what about this place?

475
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,396
This small village doesn't have tourists.

476
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Yes. You're right.

477
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,980
Right?

478
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,000
Look. Parents are always far-sighted and thorough when it comes to their children.

479
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,100
That's the way my parents are.

480
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,260
Exactly. This is it.

481
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,632
No wonder A'Yao's granny loves you.

482
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:15,180
A lass like you is pretty impressive.

483
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,040
You're smart and a sweet talker.

484
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,760
Uncle,

485
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,108
well... were you just unloading your worries

486
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:38,320
or do you want me to persuade A'Yao to go back to Beijing?

487
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,900
Bingo.

488
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,588
Ever since A'Yap returned, he hasn't benefited in the slightest.

489
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:50,220
He's everyone's go-to person now.

490
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,360
He has tons of problems weighing him down.

491
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,960
What has Xie Heshun's wood carving workshop got to do with him?

492
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,848
Well... Well... and this homestay.

493
00:30:58,848 --> 00:30:59,880
What has this got to do with him?

494
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,520
Xiao Huang is the one in charge,

495
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,000
but everyone goes to A'Yao to resolve their problems.

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,944
That's such a hassle!

497
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,020
You're right,

498
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,981
but A'Yao has already invested a lot.

499
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:17,616
If he leaves now, with all the infrastructure in place,

500
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:19,640
all his efforts will be in vain.

501
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,524
He can sell them.

502
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,300
Someone who's willing to take over

503
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,572
clearly recognizes the value of these efforts.

504
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:30,180
Don't you agree?

505
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,252
That's true.

506
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Isn't this like a mosquito who flew into a spider's web?

507
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,720
It can't escape no matter how hard it tries to fly away.

508
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,588
Why did he do all this?

509
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,520
Uncle Xie, do you want to hear my story?

510
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,620
Sure.

511
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,000
Here's the thing.

512
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
Since I graduated from college, I've been working in Beijing.

513
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,860
The hotel industry is particularly hectic.

514
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,560
Occasionally, when customers thank me,

515
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,328
I also feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition. Right?

516
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:12,992
But most of the time, I'm just working mechanically.

517
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:15,460
After working for over a decade,

518
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
I shared the same thoughts as most people.

519
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,000
I wanted to earn money for a house and a car.

520
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,040
With those, I'd be able to settle in Beijing.

521
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,260
When I returned to my hometown,

522
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,960
my relatives will think I'm very successful. Right?

523
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,200
They'll think I'm outstanding.

524
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,300
I could be a role model for the younger generation to aspire toward.

525
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,340
That's wonderful.

526
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,780
However, I never considered...

527
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,572
whether success in the conventional sense is what I really want.

528
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,204
Let's take this as an example.

529
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,220
If I only have three months left to live before I leave this world,

530
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,340
what do I really want to do?

531
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,420
What is my dream? What do I want to do?

532
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,680
I never ever thought about these.

533
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,240
It has never crossed my mind.

534
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,920
However, A'Yao and Xinxin are different.

535
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,860
They have a firm ambition and an ideal to fight for.

536
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,308
I'm very envious of them.

537
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,564
I admire them.

538
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:31,660
They aren't selfishly thinking about themselves.

539
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,600
Neither do they focus on the immediate present.

540
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,630
They have a much further destination in sight,

541
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,380
and they want to take others with them.

542
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,360
A further destination?

543
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,880
Where is it?

544
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,200
Isn't it Beijing?

545
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
How can there be a farther destination than Beijing?

546
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,744
Of course.

547
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:54,932
What about Yunmiao Village in several years or decades?

548
00:33:54,932 --> 00:34:00,720
People no longer have to leave the village to work.

549
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,060
Everyone who left will come back.

550
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,960
Why would those who leave come back?

551
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,160
They will.

552
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,940
They will as long as the village is well-developed.

553
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,620
They can build and protect their hometown.

554
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,340
The young and robust can put their talents to good use,

555
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,750
every child can grow up with their family, and the elderly will be cared for.

556
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,960
Uncle,

557
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:29,212
you and your wife worked so hard to pay for his education and changed his life.

558
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:33,492
Right now, he's returned with money and knowledge

559
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:36,480
in an attempt to change even more lives.

560
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,208
The reason you left is the reason he came back.

561
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,856
Don't you think we should support, encourage, and trust him?

562
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,860
These will last us for a lifetime.

563
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,280
These are the favorites of A'Yuan and his mom.

564
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,960
You have a large fridge anyway.

565
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Take your time to enjoy them.

566
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,200
All loaded.

567
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,680
Drive safely.

568
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,660
It'll take a few hours for you to get back. Stop by the pit stop for a break.

569
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,320
Got it.

570
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,120
Mom, listen to A'Yao.

571
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,400
Call us if you need anything.

572
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,100
Got it.

573
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,880
Do your job well.

574
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,504
Mom, I'm leaving!

575
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,432
Did your dad say anything harsh this time?

576
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:51,020
Nope.

577
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,124
Didn't you hear him tell me to do my job well?

578
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,436
That's rare.

579
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,160
Chairman Xie, want a cup of coffee?

580
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,608
No, thanks. I'll just have this.

581
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Where's Hongdou?

582
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,200
In there. Are you looking for her?

583
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,340
Nah, I was just wondering.

584
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,200
Why are you here in the afternoon?

585
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,580
I dropped by on my way back from meeting Xiao Huang at the village committee.

586
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,348
Will you pass through here to get to the village committee?

587
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,720
Where did you come from?

588
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,388
Make me a cup of coffee.

589
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:53,556
I thought you didn't want it.

590
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:57,700
I'm assessing whether she made improvements in making coffee.

591
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,320
He's doing this on purpose.

592
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,400
I'll make you a pour-over coffee.

593
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,101
That's impressive! You even mastered pour-over coffee?

594
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:06,080
I taught her.

595
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,500
This is my teacher.

596
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,200
♫ <i>There are stars in my journey</i> ♫

597
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,180
♫ <i>There are rainbows</i> ♫

598
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,244
♫ <i>We lose the chance to hug</i> ♫

599
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
Why are you laughing?

600
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,180
I'm laughing at your clumsiness.

601
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,740
Yes, you're born gifted. You've never been a rookie.

602
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,640
Pass it to me.

603
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,320
I'll help you. Put it here. Grind.

604
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,920
Grind.

605
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,220
Come on.

606
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,700
♫ <i>We say goodbye</i> ♫

607
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,621
All right, enough. You're getting the hang of it.

608
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:04,061
- Do your best.
- I'm losing my ability to do this.

609
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,796
Why are you laughing?

610
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,620
I don't know why he's laughing.

611
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,380
I just can't help but laugh.

612
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,376
♫ <i>Sometimes I find I fall in love</i> ♫

613
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,560
♫ <i>Make a little wish and pray</i> ♫

614
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,460
Chairman Xie's dad came over. So what?

615
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,241
You joined the company late, so you're clueless.

616
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:32,840
A few days ago, he came to my desk after visiting the warehouse

617
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,960
and bombarded me with questions.

618
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,600
He asked me how business has been and if there were any incidents.

619
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,760
He was even looking for Ye Sen. I said Ye Sen took a day off.

620
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,520
Yesterday, I waited until he left the tie-dye workshop before heading there.

621
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,820
He's so crafty! He harrassed me with questions once he saw me.

622
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,280
Even sitting for examinations didn't make me that nervous.

623
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,360
Why?

624
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,160
Why? Here's a question for you.

625
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,340
Since our company was established, what has been our greatest obstacle?

626
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,600
The greatest obstacle?

627
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,880
The lack of tourists, instability of online sales...

628
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,660
None of these.

629
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,280
- Well, what...
- It's Chairman Xie's dad.

630
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,480
<i>I refuse to let you sign this contract!
[Comedic effects. Please do not imitate]</i>

631
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,256
<i>If you sign it, I'll drink pesticide!</i>

632
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:15,980
<i>Dad, so many people are watching.</i>

633
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,740
<i>- Let's go home first.
- Don't come over!</i>

634
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,040
<i>I'll drink this if you do! I really will!
- Will you stop making a scene?</i>

635
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,444
<i>The village director is here.</i>

636
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:27,280
<i>-It doesn't matter even if the village director is here!
- Siping!</i>

637
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,140
<i> Don't come over!</i>

638
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,960
<i>- Don't come over!
- What are you doing?</i>

639
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,020
<i>I oppose his taking over of this tie-dye workshop!</i>

640
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,480
<i>Director, talk some sense into him!</i>

641
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,960
<i>He quit a proper job in Beijing</i>

642
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>and insisted on coming back to start a business!</i>

643
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,020
<i>I've run a business for years!</i>

644
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,120
<i>Do you think running a business is a walk in the park?!</i>

645
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,100
<i>All right. Sort this out at home.</i>

646
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,140
<i>- No!
- Discuss this at the village committee then.
- I'm not going.</i>

647
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,760
<i>Take your time to drink that. I'll sign this first.</i>

648
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,980
<i>Siping! What are you doing?</i>

649
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>Don't tear up the contract!</i>

650
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,840
<i>- Are you insane?
- I won't let you sign this!</i>

651
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,480
<i>You've torn up the whole contract!</i>

652
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,880
<i>- You can't sign it!
- Enough.</i>

653
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,648
<i>Let's talk in my office.</i>

654
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:06,100
<i>I won't allow him to sign it!
- A'Yao!</i>

655
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,220
<i>- Director...
- A'Yao, come with us.</i>

656
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,200
<i>You can't sign it!</i>

657
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,840
<i>Don't let him sign it!</i>

658
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,140
<i>Don't let him sign it!</i>

659
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,560
<i>Let's talk it out!</i>

660
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,440
<i>- Gezi.
- Brother.</i>

661
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
<i>Print another copy of the contract.</i>

662
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,120
<i>- What about this...
- Don't worry.</i>

663
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
<i>He cherishes his life. It's cola in there.</i>

664
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,040
<i>Well...</i>

665
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,361
<i>Aunties, you can leave. Don't stand around. It's fine now.</i>

666
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,820
<i>Get on with your day. Off you go.</i>

667
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,840
<i>Uncle, what are you doing?</i>

668
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,380
<i>It rains, women get married, and sons venture into business.</i>

669
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,220
<i>You can't stop him. Right?</i>

670
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,360
<i>He wants to run the homestay, right?</i>

671
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,464
<i>Fine, bring it on!</i>

672
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,020
<i>Run over me!</i>

673
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,741
<i>- Uncle, get up.
- Run over me!</i>

674
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:50,401
<i>You have to get through me first! Then, he can do as he pleases!</i>

675
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:53,060
<i>- Get up, Uncle.
- He can do as he pleases!</i>

676
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,540
<i>Excuse me.</i>

677
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,960
<i>Ye Sen, what happened?</i>

678
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,404
<i>H-He hit my leg.</i>

679
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:00,840
<i>Why did you hit him?</i>

680
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,120
<i>I didn't.</i>

681
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,060
<i>Come on, let's go to the hospital.</i>

682
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,620
<i>Don't come over.</i>

683
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,080
<i>A'Yao, your dad's here. What should we do?</i>

684
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,340
<i>Run him over.</i>

685
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,020
<i>He can lie there if he doesn't care about the pain.</i>

686
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,520
<i>You...</i>

687
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,464
<i>I object!</i>

688
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:23,080
<i>Stupid brat!</i>

689
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,440
<i>Fine.</i>

690
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,532
<i>You sure are impressive.</i>

691
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,580
<i>Stay strong! A little more!</i>

692
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,060
<i>Be careful. Be careful.</i>

693
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,240
<i>Watch your head.</i>

694
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,940
<i>Chairman Xie! Step aside.</i>

695
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,960
<i>What are you doing?</i>

696
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,560
<i>Come on. Come on in.</i>

697
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,856
<i>A'Yao!</i>

698
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,760
Get it now?

699
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,676
Every time I think of this old man, my leg hurts.

700
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,841
You know what? Luckily, his dad has a business in Kunming and can't stick around all day long.

701
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:03,760
In the past two years, he came back to make a scene whenever he had the time.

702
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,840
It's less frequent these days, but he bombards everyone with questions when he's back.

703
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,460
I bet his dad hasn't given up yet. Don't you think so?

704
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,120
That's for sure. Don't you think so?

705
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,140
Look at the mess you guys made.

706
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,940
You're back!

707
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,680
Chairman Xie, has Uncle left?

708
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,480
Yeah, he left.

709
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,700
That's good.

710
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,800
It's good that he's left.

711
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,440
Hey, why are you afraid of him?

712
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,320
When he caused that ridiculous commotion, I wasn't even afraid.

713
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,260
You're the only one undaunted by Uncle Siping.

714
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,140
All of us are terrified of him.

715
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,336
This time, he told me to do my job well.

716
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:40,080
All right, let's have our meeting once you've tidied up the place.

717
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,580
Okay.

718
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,780
Sure.
