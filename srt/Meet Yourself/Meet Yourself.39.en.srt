<i>[Episode 39]</i>

3
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,200
The village committee always has its doors open!

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,250
You could've come over to consult us!

5
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,720
You just had to pick a time when I was out for a meeting

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,249
and Hongdou's boyfriend was away

7
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,210
to kick up a fuss at the construction site!

8
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,430
What on earth do you want?

9
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,200
We weren't doing anything.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,850
We just... wanted to hear the truth from her.

11
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,550
What truth is this? Can't the village committee answer you?

12
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,550
A bunch of guys ganging up on a young lady!

13
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,940
Shame on you!

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,540
Think about your daughter! What if someone did this to her?

15
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,319
And you! Why don't you just take my position as the director?

16
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,220
You can take whatever bribes Xie Zhiyao sends over!

17
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,770
My anxiety drove me insane. I didn't mean it.

18
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,540
This is pure rumor-mongering! Get it?

19
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,030
Didn't we explain many times why we didn't approve of your businesses?

20
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,920
Are you deaf?

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,310
Running a homestay using your residence is illegal!

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,490
You can't even get a business license.

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,659
If you insist on running it, any safety risks are beyond you!

24
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,990
Why would the village committee provide a loan guarantee?

25
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,090
The committee made these decisions!

26
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,120
Xie Zhiyao has no say! Why are you blaming him?!

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,230
Calm down.

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,190
Listen up. Delete the video clips you have.

29
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,800
If this gets onto the internet, no one will ever invest in our village.

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
Over the years, Xie Zhiyao worked so hard for our village.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,930
He contributed a lot of money to the construction of roads and bridges.

32
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,229
You know all of this! He was commended for these!

33
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,300
If he really wanted to monopolize profits,

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,940
he'd be accepting investments without a thought.

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,720
But this isn't what he wants!

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,570
Stop praising him.

37
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,070
No one would give up profits.

38
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,309
I'm not praising him.

39
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,150
If we go along with this potential investor,

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,550
the village will undergo comprehensive commercial development.

41
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,100
Our village will just be a faux display of history.

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,080
Daily life would be impossible in such an environment.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,850
In the end, we'll be flooded with retailers and tourists.

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,240
Our village's untainted history will be eroded!

45
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,310
Recite the discussion from yesterday's meeting to them.

46
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,239
The town council said this.

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,269
We can only develop tourism here based on three conditions.

48
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,719
Environmental protection, cultural preservation,

49
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,930
and preservation of the living quality of residents.

50
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,660
We must avoid reckless developments in pursuit of profits.

51
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,140
We must abide by the concept of sustainable development.

52
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,080
Any investor or entrepreneur must abide by these conditions.

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,210
We can only approve reasonable requests.

54
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,330
This applies to everyone, with no exceptions.

55
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,770
Look at the homestays in the village.

56
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,020
They all signed leases with us.

57
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,280
They have agreements on sanitation and ensuring peace for the residents.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,709
These are written documents. There are other verbal agreements as well.

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,800
Do you understand?

60
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,500
<i> Nope.</i>

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,970
That's fine.

62
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,220
I've recorded everything we just said. I'll send you a copy.

63
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,170
I'll send it to everyone who was part of the riot but couldn't come here today.

64
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,970
Listen to it repeatedly. You'll get it sooner or later.

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,059
All in all, it's as the village director mentioned.

66
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,490
Apologize to Hongdou at once.

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,220
You were utterly barbaric.

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,500
But... look at the wound from their beating. It's still swelled up.

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,170
Here, too. Shouldn't they apologize to us?

70
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,620
Exactly.

71
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,060
You were the ones who barged in to tear down the place.

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,680
That was self-defense on their part.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
If the police came, they'd have arrested you guys.

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,750
Anything else?

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,500
Come to a consensus on the apology yourself!

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
What were you thinking? You're dismissed!

77
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,160
Hello?

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,820
We need 250 more bricks.

79
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,110
Is there enough in stock?

80
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,190
When can you deliver them?

81
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,269
Okay. Please get the product number right.

82
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,360
Okay. Thank you.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,550
Grandpa Yang.

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,080
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,460
You sure have balls of steel!

86
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,880
How dare you show up here!

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,870
We're here to apologize!

88
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,609
I'll... I'll beat you up!

89
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:47,020
Learn your lesson!

90
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,590
Granny Yang.

91
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,200
Where's my granny?

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,680
She left with your girlfriend.

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,560
Okay, I'll leave you to your work.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,190
Sure.

95
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,560
This morning, I was startled when Grandpa Yang came over.

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,370
I thought he came over to quarrel with me.

97
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,800
He sat there all day and left briefly for lunch.

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,429
He came right back after that, but he didn't say a word.

99
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:28,050
I made him some tea, and he took it.

100
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,699
Once those men showed up, guess what?

101
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,330
Grandpa Yang rushed over with his cane.

102
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,250
He had nothing much to do,

103
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,970
so I asked him to keep watch over you.

104
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,330
Granny, you're the best. I can always count on you.

105
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,010
- You bet!
- Of course.

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,920
A'Yao is the only one who thinks I'm useless.

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,540
A'Yao?

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,110
Of course. He's a know-it-all.

109
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,619
He's the sun that shines above us.

110
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,160
He's the only god around.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,560
He'll shoulder the whole sky.

112
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,250
Don't be angry at him. I chided him this morning.

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,730
How is that possible? Granny, don't coax me.

114
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,909
I won't. Ignore him if you want to.

115
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,070
Just don't get angry.

116
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,870
How can I quell my anger?

117
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,630
He never sticks with what he says!

118
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,399
He's already doing this.

119
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,870
How am I supposed to correct him if I let him continue?

120
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll help you.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,889
You won't. I bet you'll side with him.

122
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,789
I promise. I'll teach him a lesson he'll remember.

123
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,300
- Really?
- Yes!

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Helping you is akin to helping him.

125
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,390
Come on. Try this.

126
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,520
Granny, goodness gracious.

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,160
You're so good with words.

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,370
Xu Hongdou.

129
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,900
Xu Hongdou!

130
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,640
Xu...

131
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,700
Mr. Hu? What's wrong?

132
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,840
Old Xie.

133
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,290
What happened?

134
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,670
My mom said...

135
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,720
my dad...

136
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,830
What about him?

137
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,200
He wanted me to go home for dinner on New Year's Eve.

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
You scared the hell out of me.

139
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,670
Old Xie!

140
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,920
- Come here. Stay with me.
- Wait.

141
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,520
How about tomorrow?

142
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,740
This is the perfect time.

143
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,920
I have something very important to tell you.

144
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,900
Come on, sit down.

145
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,630
Fine.

146
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,220
Go ahead.

147
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,250
I think...

148
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm in love with her.

149
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,550
There are so many ladies around. Which one are you talking about?

150
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,510
What the hell?

151
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,030
I only care about Sister Bai.

152
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,240
And?

153
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,520
How should I tell my parents about this?

154
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,100
How would I know?

155
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,060
No, wait.

156
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,250
It's been so long. Finally, I get to eat at home.

157
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,550
If I told them about her, they'd never agree. Right?

158
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,570
Besides, my dad is in poor health. I'm afraid that the moment I tell them—

159
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,820
Hold on a second.

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,440
Has Sister Manjun agreed to date you?

161
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,339
Not yet.

162
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,570
Are you insane? You aren't even dating. Stop wasting my time.

163
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,649
Hold on, Old Xie. Please! Listen to me!

164
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,620
I'm forward planning, just like you.

165
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,089
Isn't that right? I want to clear the path for love.

166
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,050
I've cleared it so well that she's ignoring me now.

167
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,520
Go on with whatever clearing you want to.

168
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,080
We're alike in our misery.

169
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,620
<i>The door is unlocked. Come in.</i>

170
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,120
How can I help you, Chairman Xie?

171
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,060
"A letter of apology."

172
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,600
"Dear Ms. Xu Hongdou.

173
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Nice to meet you.

174
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,850
I am writing to sincerely apologize to you.

175
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,170
I am sorry.

176
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,569
After reflecting on myself for the entire day,

177
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,259
I have realized that everything happened

178
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:41,559
due to my complacency, arrogance, and desire for self-gratification.

179
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,520
As a result, a rift has appeared in our relationship.

180
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,099
If this isn't mended, a severe trust issue will arise

181
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:53,340
which will indubitably affect our relationship.

182
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,449
As the saying goes, 'As you sow, so shall you reap.'

183
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:02,149
This seed of doubt will result in catastrophes.

184
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,989
Thus, please allow me to apologize from the bottom of my heart.

185
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:10,760
I am sorry. I have erred.

186
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,430
If I have the honor to be forgiven,

187
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,760
I promise my absolute loyalty to you.

188
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,769
I will hide no secrets from you,

189
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,650
including matters on work, my life,

190
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,619
and my personal thoughts.

191
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:26,119
I hope we can build an equal and amicable relationship based on mutual support.

192
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,410
P.S.

193
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,300
I will take full responsibility for all the emotional losses

194
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,980
this concealment of information might have caused.

195
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,730
Yours, Xie Zhiyao."

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,500
Let's get up to some mischief together.

Mischief?

210

Let's go.

211
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,370
- This is it.
- Right here?

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,439
What are you looking for?

213
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,909
I'm searching for surveillance cameras.

214
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:47,759
I've checked. There aren't any.

215
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,560
What an expert.

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,199
Come on. Here.

217
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Make it big. I want to cover a large area.

218
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,609
I saw him! He was furious!

219
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,980
I bet he knows who wrote it.

220
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,620
So what?

221
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,529
He won't go after the suspects.

222
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,350
Why did they graffiti his door instead of another house?

223
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,450
I'm sure everyone knows he's behind it.

224
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,700
Exactly. That guy went to town to buy spray paint.

225
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,450
The surveillance camera there caught him.

226
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,239
What a fool who thinks himself clever.

227
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,410
He must have his reasons for this, but he deserves this punishment!

228
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,840
Aunty A'Gui!

229
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,250
I'm working!

230
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,020
Baoping! Aren't I working?

231
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,260
Yes, you are!

232
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,700
You're working your hands and your mouth.

233
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Ms. Xu Hongdou, regarding my apology letter...

234
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,580
Going to Beijing?

235
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,420
Put it down! Let me do it!

236
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,920
It's okay. This isn't heavy.

237
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,160
Pass it to me.

238
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,509
- Why are you heading to Beijing out of the blue?
- It's a long story.

239
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:24,420
I haven't given up my place in Beijing.

240
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,819
The water pipe started leaking, and the water dripped into the house below mine.

241
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,200
The landlord just called me and asked me to hurry back.

242
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,540
He's there with plumbers right now.

243
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,190
All my belongings are there. I have to go back.

244
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,169
That's urgent.

245
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll go with you.

246
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,540
Don't do that. The construction site needs your supervision.

247
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,479
How about driving me to the airport?

248
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,900
- Sure.
- Okay.

249
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,860
The flight is at nine.

250
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,880
Sure, let's go.

251
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,110
Your phone.

252
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,440
Let me answer the call.

253
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,350
Li Qing, what's up?

254
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Aren't you visiting the university with Ms. Xie?

255
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,970
Why are you crying?

256
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,550
Calm down.

257
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,060
Is Xiaoyue with you? Put her on the phone.

258
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,100
What happened to Ms. Xie?

259
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,870
What? Which hospital?

260
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,770
Okay. Don't panic. I'm on my way. Calm down.

261
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,690
Okay, bye.

262
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,140
Hongdou, I can't drive you to the airport.

263
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,910
I need to get to the hospital.

264
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,710
I'll get a taxi to send you to the airport.

265
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,050
Hold on. What happened?

266
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,970
It's Ms. Xie. She had a heart attack.

267
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,980
She's in the hospital now.

268
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,480
Calm down.

269
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,910
I'll cancel my flight.

270
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll go to the hospital with you.

271
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,350
You can't drive like this.

272
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,530
Give me the key. I'll drive.

273
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Let's go.

274
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,900
Xiaoyue.

275
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,399
How is Ms. Xie?

276
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,999
The doctor confirmed that she's not in danger, but she hasn't woken up.

277
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,960
Why did she faint?

278
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,910
The doctor says it's due to excessive fatigue.

279
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,850
She'll be fine.

280
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,239
Chairman Xie. Sister Hongdou. The restaurants are closed now.

281
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,410
So, I got you some buns and soy milk.

282
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,970
- Thank you.
- Sure.

283
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,620
Anything will do.

284
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,740
I'll head in.

285
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,140
Thank you.

286
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,800
What about your place in Beijing?

287
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,530
I'll leave it be. The landlord is there.

288
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,380
My belongings are soaked anyway. Her life is more important.

289
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,860
Thankfully, I've got you.

290
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,100
When I got the call, I panicked.

291
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,139
That's why we need a partner.

292
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:20,910
You're standing before me, guarding me.

293
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,950
I've got your back when you need support.

294
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,030
Would you please share some of your burdens with me?

295
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,040
Have faith in me.

296
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,020
I hear you.

297
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,240
Your apology letter is approved.

298
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,340
Thank you.

299
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,350
No problem.

300
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,129
Harley Davidson, Sportster. X48.

301
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,840
A nice motorcycle, but it runs out of fuel easily.

302
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>Thank you for the lift!</i>

303
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,540
<i>It was fun tonight!</i>

304
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,869
<i>Drive safely. Bye-bye.</i>

305
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,560
- Xiao Yu?
- Hey.

306
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,590
You're still up?

307
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,690
I left the door open for you.

308
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,610
Have a seat.

309
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,490
Where did you go?

310
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,610
I went camping.

311
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,690
Who drove you back?

312
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,210
A young lad I met while camping.

313
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,350
What's wrong?

314
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,230
It's nothing.

315
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,650
No, that's not it.

316
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,540
I need to tell you something.

317
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,060
Is it about your family?

318
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,920
It's about me.

319
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,830
Go ahead.

320
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,440
I lied to you about something.

321
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,210
Actually, I'm not talented.

322
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,300
No way.

323
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,680
I love "Wind," that song you wrote.

324
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,500
If not for that song, I wouldn't even be here.

325
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,240
I didn't write that song.

326
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,580
Fine...

327
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,540
I wrote the lyrics.

328
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,390
But the melody came from a friend.

329
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,250
The music I composed was trash.

330
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,480
Perhaps... I can only compose soppy songs

331
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,990
with catchy lyrics like "A Lonely Man."

332
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,820
The kind of talent that appeals to you?

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't have it.

334
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,000
I know. I'm not smart enough to fool you.

335
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,500
You'll find out soon enough.

336
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,800
Perhaps you already know.

337
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Rather than be exposed by you,

338
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,000
I'd rather fess up.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I can be a yardstick for your standards.

340
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,500
What standards?

341
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
Don't you have some kind of standard

342
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,600
to gauge men?

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,100
For example: talent, income,

344
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,700
age, personality, and potential demands of you.

345
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,200
Right?

346
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Do I...

347
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,600
fall within your range of consideration?

348
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,300
In my mind, you're like a goddess.

349
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,000
I mean it.

350
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
You're a goddess holding the torch high,

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
showing me the way,

352
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
telling me to love myself, and hold my head high.

353
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I shouldn't debase myself. I can't be arrogant either.

354
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,400
From now on, I won't believe in anything else...

355
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,000
but you.

356
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
But...

357
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm afraid you don't like me.

358
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
What's your opinion?

359
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Xiao Yu, I'll be frank with you.

360
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,000
Firstly, I think you're talented.

361
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have persevered for so long.

362
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,100
You wouldn't be burning with such passion.

363
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,200
Of course,

364
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,600
you might not be the stereotypical prodigy,

365
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,200
but you're still talented to a certain extent.

366
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm no goddess either.

367
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm just older than you...

368
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,900
and lived a few more years.

369
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,000
So, I'm more experienced in life. That's all.

370
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,000
I wanted to tell you something tomorrow,

371
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,500
but I'll tell you today since we're chatting now.

372
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm returning to Beijing in two days.

373
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,500
Why?

374
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,200
I found a job as a home organizer.

375
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,500
Look at me. I've been a housewife for years.

376
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,100
I'm great at such tasks.

377
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,000
This job is perfect for me,

378
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,200
and the company wants me to report in soon.

379
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
What about me?

380
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,000
We can text each other.

381
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Can't we meet?

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,200
If you come to Beijing, give me a call.

383
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll treat you to a meal.

384
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,700
Xiao Yu.

385
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,200
I really enjoyed my days here.

386
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,400
When I'm away, work hard to pursue music.

387
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,600
Wherever I am,

388
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll cheer you on.

389
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I've always got your back.

Ms. Xie.

408
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Aunty, you're awake.

409
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
How do you feel?

410
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,000
A'Yao.

411
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,100
I'm here.

412
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
When I'm gone,

413
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
don't be sad.

414
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,800
I've lived my life for myself.

415
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,800
I've had a fulfilling life...

416
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
with no regrets.

417
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,400
Aunty.

418
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
You'll be fine.

419
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Aunty. Aunty!

420
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
I thought you were at the construction site.

421
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm here to accompany Ms. Xie.

422
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,000
Aunty! I told you. You need to rest at home.

423
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Why are you at the embroidery workshop again?

424
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,100
Please take good care of yourself.

425
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,700
You can only make more embroideries if you're in a good health.

426
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
You'll lose everything once you're ill.

427
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
I can't always stay in bed.

428
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,000
I've recovered.

429
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
I just came here to take a look and get some sun.

430
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
It's good for my health.

431
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,700
Li Qing is so strict. She even forbids me to pick up the needles.

432
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,300
What did you cook?

433
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,600
I made fish soup.

434
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,500
I kept some for you at home. We can eat together later.

435
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,800
Let's share this. It's too much for me.

436
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,500
This isn't much. Take your time.

437
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,800
For breakfast, you always have buns and porridge.

438
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,200
Those aren't nutritious.

439
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,700
If I knew about your eating habits,

440
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,600
I would've asked Li Qing to keep an eye on you.

441
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
When you woke up in the hospital

442
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
and held my hand while saying,

443
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,800
"A'Yao, when I'm gone, don't be sad."

444
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,600
You scared the hell out of me.

445
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,000
I was muddled back then.

446
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
That was my first time

447
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,500
hearing someone say they lived without regrets.

448
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,300
Is that for real?

449
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I have just one.

450
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,100
What's that?

451
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,400
When I was young, I used to be passionate in love.

452
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,300
Edward wrote me a letter once.

453
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,000
He told me he was getting married,

454
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,900
and he wished me happiness.

455
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
I didn't reply.

456
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,500
Edward?

457
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,600
Her ex-boyfriend, the French painter.

458
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,000
I wish I wrote a letter back

459
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
to wish him happiness, too.

460
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
Aunty Huailan.

461
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,200
You're quite a fool in love.

462
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,100
This is such a wonderful love.

463
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,600
What's this about a fool in love?

464
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
What's that?

465
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
It means that when you're in love,

466
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,200
you'll lose all reason like a fool.

467
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
Aren't you the same?

468
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,900
Of course, I am!

469
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm a typical fool in love.

470

Why stuff them in the luggage?

478
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,400
Can you send them back by delivery?

479
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,800

Only accept them when there aren't any problems.

483
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,900

You two will only be in Beijing for a few days.

I haven't seen such busy streets in years.

496
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,100
I've only been away for a while,

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,400

- A honeymoon.
- Newlyweds?

I can tell that you're a match made in heaven. Congratulations.

Not yet. Any suggestions?

506
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
As the capital city, Beijing is full of fun places.

507
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,800
All these spots are widely known.

508
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
There are the Forbidden City,

509
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,600
the Bird's Nest Stadium, and Sanlitun.

510
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
In the morning, you can go to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag-raising ceremony.

511
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,200
In the afternoon, you can visit the Great Wall of Badaling.

512
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,600
At night, you can enjoy delicacies with your wife at South Luogu Lane.

513
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,400
There are so many places to go. It all depends on your interests.

Great. We'll look them up at the hotel.

515
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,600
By the way, the hotel you chose lies right by the subway's entrance.

The room looks nice.

550

Don't lie down once you come in. Your clothes must be dirty.

Take a shower and change your clothes. Come on.

We can wash them at my place. The laundry here is expensive.

<i>You arrived in Beijing alone.</i>

602
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,100
Now, you're leaving Beijing alone.

603
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,400
It's so sad to be all by yourself.

604
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,500
You're overthinking.

605
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,000
This trip to Beijing feels different.

606
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,200
What do you mean?

607
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,000
Perhaps I have a different state of mind now.

608
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm no longer asking for anything here.

609
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,100
It's a relief.

610
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,000
Rather, more possibilities seem to be awaiting.

611
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,000
When your business flourishes,

612
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
you can run a homestay in the Beijing suburbs, right by the Great Wall.

613
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,200
I visited the villages near the mountains.

614
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
They're pretty much untainted.

615
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,500
The villagers still burn firewood and build their houses using stones nearby.

616
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,600
Think about it. During the weekend, just a short drive of three hours

617
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,900
can get you away from life.

618
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,200
The fresh air fills your lungs

619
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,100
as you experience the essence of life.

620
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,200
- That's in line with your philosophy.
- That sounds appealing.

621
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,500
Hear this. In the northern mountains, the four seasons are very distinct.

622
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
The scenery varies depending on the seasons.

623
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,600
Think about it. When it snows in winter, you can start a fire in the house

624
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,100
and watch the snow outside.

625
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,500
It'll be beautiful.

626
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,200
Even the thought of it is lovely.

627
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,000
Here's a heads-up.

628
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,100
You must be prepared.

629
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,200
If my homestay is booming,

630
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,700
I'd definitely be managing branches in different areas.

631
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,500
Don't give me that look.

632
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,400
Bubbling with objections?

633
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,200
I've been keeping a secret from you.

634
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,900
What is it this time?

635
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,700
Actually,

636
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,900
Granny saved a lot of money for my betrothal gifts.

637
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,000
I can use this money to buy plane tickets.

638
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,200
You scared me!

639
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,800
I'm serious.

640
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,600
When you were planning to return to Beijing,

641
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,900
my plan was to fly here every week to meet you.

642
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,600
You're all talk.

643

- You don't have the time for that.
- I'll make time.

644
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,800
In order to achieve one's desires, we have to channel time, energy,

645
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,600
and the hard work for the climb.

646
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,800
Even if the sky blesses me with raining pies, I dare not take them.
