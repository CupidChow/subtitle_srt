He always coddles me with these weird things.

<i>[Who was the first person who gave it to you?]</i>

15
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,839
I'm serious. I really can't stand my dad. You know

16
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:52,639
if I posted his deeds on the internet, he'd receive over 3,000 bad comments.

17
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,680
Take Cuo Bazi as an example.

18
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,319
I told him from the very start that I wouldn't walk him.

19
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
The owner is supposed to walk the dog. Right?

20
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,560
My dad really threw him out.

21
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,879
When he brought the dog downstairs, he even said,

22
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,340
"Your sister doesn't want you."

23
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,540
I felt myself suffocating.

24
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,599
Your life is great.

25
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,819
Other kids want to raise a dog, but their parents won't let them.

26
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,500
You know what?

27
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,620
When I was little, I raised two rabbits.

28
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,660
My sister hated them.

29
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,760
Have you seen rabbit poop?

30
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,840
Those round pellets.

31
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,999
Aren't they dollops?

32
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,359
Nope.

33
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,119
A little smaller than sheep droppings.

34
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,640
Small, round beads.

35
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,059
If you're near-sighted, you'd mistake them for chocolate beans.

36
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,499
I'm a big fan of chocolate.

37
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,940
Your metaphor is traumatizing me.

38
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,740
By the way, Hongdou,

39
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,719
we saw the your post on WeChat Moments.

40
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,439
You said this is the second ring you've received.

41
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,740
In that case, when was the first time?

42
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,340
Is there a story?

43
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
There is.

44
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,580
But it's not what you guys are thinking.

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,400
The first person who gave me a ring

46
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,540
was my best friend.

47
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,880
Her name is Chen Nanxing.

48
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,460
We went to college together.

49
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,360
We even shared a room with each other for four years.

50
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,520
Both of us remained in Beijing...

51
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,800
and supported each other.

52
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,660
It's a friendship that lasted over a decade.

53
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,579
You have a homestay here now.

54
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,640
Invite her over someday.

55
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,220
She can't come.

56
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,339
Is she too busy with work to take a holiday?

57
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,620
No, that's not it.

58
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,000
She passed away last year.

59
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,460
It's fine.

61
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,580
Actually, I really wanted to share this with you.

62
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,140
That's because you're my dear friends.

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,540
I hope she can live on in another way.

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Every time her name is mentioned...

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,580
or her stories...

66
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,760
are circulating among us,

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,440
she will always exist.

68
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Why am I crying again?

69
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,779
I'm sorry. Xie Zhiyao told me this.

70
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,199
I'm not sure if I'm quoting him accurately.

71
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,000
It's more or less this.

72
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,600
I get it.

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,520
Right now, she exists in here.

74
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,580
Chen...

75
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,879
Chen Nanxing.

76
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,560
Nanxing.

77
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,420
Nanxing for the southern star.

78
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,500
No, that's not right.

79
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,100
It stands for arum lilies.

Na Na, are you still asleep?

85
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,500
What's wrong, Mr. Ma?

86
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm going to leave.

87
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,580
Keep this.

88
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,960
A master gave it to me.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,519
It turns ill luck into good fortune and calamities into blessings.

90
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,520
Make sure you don't lose it.

91
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,560
Na Na, keep an open mind.

92
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
Walk when you can't run.

93
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,920
When you can't run, meditate.

94
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,120
All mountains can be conquered somehow.

95
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,460
You're clearly still in dreamland.

96
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,739
Go back to sleep.

97
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm leaving.

98
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,440
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

99

101
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,979
<i>Where is this place?</i>

102
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,359
<i>Impossible.</i>

103
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,719
<i>Well, that person isn't important. Did you stay up all night?</i>

104
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,820
<i>- That was you.
- Really?</i>

105
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,460
<i>- Yeah.
- All right, enough about me.</i>

<i>The one who lit candles downstairs, right?</i>

109
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,260
<i>Yes! He also lit candles.</i>

110
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,580
<i>Enough about that. Don't mention that again.</i>

111
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,639
Don't talk badly about my girlfriend.

112
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,200
In the middle of the night, your ex-boyfriend also...

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
Which one are you talking about?

114
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,800
Mr. Hu!

115
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,580
You're back!

116
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,500
Heading to the kindergarten?

117
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,680
Are these two your friends?

118
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,860
My college classmates.

119
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,980
Let me introduce him.

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,000
This is Mr. Hu, my neighbor.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,199
He sings at the bar every night, and he's a great singer.

122
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,299
Hello, Mr. Hu.

123
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,600
- Hi, Mr. Hu.
- Hello.

124
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,440
How about this?

125
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,460
Let's go sing together tonight. My treat.

126
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,839
Well, maybe next time.

127
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,579
We're taking a road trip to Meili to see the sunset in the snow mountains.

128
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:11,620
That's right.

129
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,300
Do you think Li Jianfeng will join us if I invite him?

130
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,280
Tell him Bai Manjun is with us, and he'll definitely come.

131
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,059
You're right. Nonsense.

132
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,299
I'll text him.

133
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
- Come on.
- Yes, do that. Let me take a look.

134
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,940
Don't send weird messages. Don't text him.

135
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,179
You're not stopping me.

136
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,519
The other day, he told me he remembered everything between you two.

137
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,899
He's still single.

138
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,279
Don't you think it's because of you?

139
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,219
Yeah.

140
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,579
<i>What does that have to do with me?</i>

141
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,760
<i>Do you remember? When we were in college—</i>

142
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
<i>- Don't talk nonsense.
- He gave you a love letter!</i>

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,900
<i>Yeah!</i>

144
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,959
<i>I wrote the letter for him.</i>

145
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,139
<i>What did you write in the letter?</i>

146
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,959
<i>That's enough, you two.</i>

147
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,540
<i>A strand of your hair brushed against my cheek.</i>

148
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,320
I don't want to use non-slip mats in the shower room.

149
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,660
I want this.

150
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,240
Wooden mats made of antiseptic wood.

151
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,799
These will do as well, but they aren't easy to clean.

152
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,439
Yes, we have to dismantle them each time,

153
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,960
but these are far more comfortable to step on.

154
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,399
Okay, let's go with this.

155
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,999
I'll take the measurements and let you know.

156
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,440
Okay.

157
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,280
Why didn't you reply to my message?

158
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,759
Where are you going? Aren't you supposed to be shopping?

159
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,039
I just got back from the horse ranch.

160
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,180
I'll go after I send Cutie Pie back.

161
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,940
Well, get going.

162
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,139
Xiaochun is unloading at the warehouse today.

163
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,079
Xiao Xin is alone in the cafe. She's all alone, so I'm going to help her.

164
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
Why didn't you reply to my message?

165
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,719
I was drinking with Na Na in her room last night and my phone was charging.

166
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,000
But you didn't reply to me this morning.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,799
I did that on purpose. Stop asking.

168
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,900
Why didn't you reply?

169
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,260
Who was the first ring from?

170
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm not going to tell you.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,999
I'll make you feel anxious, worried, agonized, and jittery.

172
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,439
That was how I felt yesterday

173
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,359
when you suggested that Na Na help you sell goods through live streaming.

174
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,420
You can have a taste of it.

175
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,520
Hold on. Why are you still holding a grudge?

176
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,679
Just tell me.

177
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,480
I won't. I'm busy. Take care.

178
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,999
- Goodbye.
- I'm childish?

179
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,340
Aren't you more childish than me?

180
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,079
You're wandering around on a horse during the day.

181
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,999
I didn't even say you're a braggart.

182
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,920
There are modern means of transport around, okay?

183
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,200
You're the biggest baby around.

184
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,019
A grass ring? Do you think you can fool me with that?

185
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,180
How about money?

186
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,519
Make some money first.

187
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,179
You sure are smug.

188
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,360
Riding a white horse in the streets during the day.

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm doing this so I can meet you.

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,239
I'm going to Baoshan on business today, and I'll stay there for a night.

191
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,880
I'm not coming back tonight.

192
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,000
I hope you and Daxia have a safe trip.

193
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,680
How clingy.

194
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,559
Chen Nanxing gave me the ring.

195
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,440
Chen Nanxing!

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,800
Be careful, it's hot.

197
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,840
No way. Are these people crazy?

198
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,419
Shall we unplug the phone?

199
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,260
We did that yesterday, didn't we?

200
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,040
I saw that it was unplugged in the morning, so I plugged it back.

201
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,600
Hello, how can I help you?

202
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,759
Sorry. We don't know this person.

203
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,640
Your refreshments.

204
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,180
When you finish the tea, you can ask us to refill the water.

205
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,980
Is Nana-chan doing well?

206
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,880
She's doing fine.

207
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Has she been a waitress here for the past year?

208
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,540
- Do you want some honey in the tea?
- No, thanks.

209
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,980
All right. Please enjoy.

210
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,479
"The hero is too weak."

211
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,779
"He's waiting for the heroine to rescue him?"

212
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,999
"I don't want to read it anymore."

213
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,440
"Was the author's brain eaten by zombies?"

214
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,999
How is he weak?

215
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,840
A team should work together to battle the enemy.

216
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,599
"The heroine was utterly trashed."

217
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,379
"Is Damai Cha very ugly, too?"

218
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,379
"She's just venting on society. It's hard to imagine this scene."

219
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,999
"Horrible work. Stop writing."

220
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,160
What's the matter with him?

221
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,280
There's this one as well.

222
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,299
"Too much foreshadowing."

223
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,839
"It's neither exciting nor sweet."

224
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,439
"Both the hero and heroine have exes."

225
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,020
"Is such characterization even necessary?

226
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,650
So gross."

227
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,020
This is funny.

228
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,999
"Is the heroine also a musclebrain? All she does is fight."

229
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,519
"Damai Cha has a record of celebrating violence."

230
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,360
You like to celebrate violence?

231
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,280
Stop reading these awful comments to me.

232
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,999
These are mild comments.

233
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,479
They aren't awful.

234
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,900
Besides, they paid money to read the chapters.

235
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,799
I didn't even recite a single one

236
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,599
of those awful reviews, complaints, and comments saying they want me dead.

237
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,380
I know.

238
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,640
But I just have a feeling that's hard to describe.

239
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Na Na, I'm going to tell you something, but you can't get mad at me.

240
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,080
What is it?

241
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,199
After I found out what happened to you,

242
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,780
I felt the distance between us shrink immensely.

243
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,279
We've witnessed the same world

244
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,439
and suffered the crushing weight of verbal abuse and harassment.

245
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,960
Don't you agree?

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,080
You can empathize with me, can't you?

247
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,279
So can you.

248
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,019
You helped me so much. Wasn't that because you could empathize?

249
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,080
I just... wanted you to pull yourself up.

250
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,480
I want to do the same.

251
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,319
So, you should believe that once you survive this battle,

252
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,340
you'll be able to get yourself together and move on.

253
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,160
Don't come over! Don't come over!

254
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,900
It's Cuo Bazi.

255
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,119
Hold it down.

256
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,880
Make sure it doesn't move.

257
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,700
How do you feel?

258
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,980
It feels so soft.

259
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,980
Let me touch it again.

260
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,060
What... What is it... doing?

261
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,319
The abdomen is the weakest part of a dog's body.

262
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,879
This means it trusts you.

263
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,840
It showed its weakest part to you.

264
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,800
Can I touch it?

265
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,320
The belly feels even softer.

266
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,220
You're so amazing.

267
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,860
Me?

268
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,700
I think you're pretty amazing, too.

269
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,420
I know what happened to you.

270
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,879
You used the earnings from live streaming on your birthday

271
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:47,940
to help a sick fan and donated quite a hefty sum to Project Hope.

272
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,519
It's nothing. Only a few tens of thousands of yuan.

273
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,839
There is always news about entrepreneurs

274
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,839
and celebrities donating tens of millions on the internet.

275
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,979
We've seen too many similar articles.

276
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,579
So, tens of thousands don't seem notable.

277
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,300
Actually, you're unaware of the good you've done.

278
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,380
At the school where my mother teaches at,

279
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,919
¥1,00 can cover a child's school fees and living expenses for one year.

280
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,699
¥100,000 is enough

281
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:21,599
to help 30 poverty-stricken kids cover three years of compulsory education.

282
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,959
30 kids.

283
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,140
That's enough to form a class.

284
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,079
It's not that we can't change the world.

285
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,739
On the contrary, everything we do is subtly changing the world.

286
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:42,319
If we're more loving and caring,

287
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,900
then the world will become a better place.

288
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,900
If we're cold and unscrupulous,

289
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,520
the world will be harder to live in.

290
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,100
I think Xinxin has offered a reverse perspective.

291
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,839
We often say we can't change the world,

292
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,020
but we hope the world won't change us.

293
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,700
However, people are ever-changing.

294
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,339
As we get older, gain more experience,

295
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,299
and meet more people,

296
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,780
who can guarantee that we won't change?

297
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,560
Cuo Bazi.

298
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,599
Do you want to give it a hug?

299
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,240
I don't dare to.

300
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
Be brave.

301
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,679
Give it a big hug. Try it.

302
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,760
Let me try.

303
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,240
Come on.

304
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
A big hug, a big hug.

305
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,980
<i>[Youfeng Cafe]
Why did you choose this profession?</i>

306
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,640
<i>Have you ever felt afraid?</i>

307
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,979
<i>I'm fearless.</i>

310

<i>what was the greatest change you underwent?</i>

311
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,300
Sister Hongdou, what are you watching?

312
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,680
"Imperfect Human."

313
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,099
I think I've heard about that. Is it a variety show?

314
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,520
A talk show.

315
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,320
Which star is being interviewed?

316
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,620
A mortician.

317
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,460
Just a normal person.

318
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,799
An ordinary person?

319
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,540
I bet this show isn't popular.

320
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,520
Here's the business card Hongdou wants to pass on to you.

321
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,039
She went to visit Granny Xie at her home.

322
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,520
She says you should think about this.

323
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,800
What show is this?

324
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,079
A talk show, but not the clout-chasing type.

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,340
Why don't you check your email again?

326
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,679
Hongdou said Xiaochun sent you the most precious thing in the world.

327
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,720
What is it?

328
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,380
A kind and gentle heart.

329
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,500
Check it out.

330
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,700
So embarrassing.

331
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Damai, are you asleep?

332
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Not yet.

333
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,600
Do you think it's a good idea

334
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,400
for me to restart live streaming?

335
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,600
What are you going to do?

336
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,400
I want to sing and help sell products.

337
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Netizens will cancel you if you sell things online.

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
I want to support the farmers and agriculture.

339
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,400
I can sell products from the village

340
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,700
and promote this place.

341
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
You'll stop running away?

342
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,300
Yeah.

343
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,800
You're no longer scared?

344
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm scared,

345
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,800
but you guys have been putting armor plates on me.

346
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,400
Now, I'm shielded well.

347
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,200
I can withstand any kind of damage.

348
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Do you mean it?

349
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,400
I've thought this through.

350
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,900
I need to face my fears and do something meaningful.

351
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
How can I help you?

352
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Cheer me on.

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,100
That's easy.

354
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,500
You can do it! You can do it!

355
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,300
That's not enough.

356
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,800
Not enough?

357
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,200
Beware!

358
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,800
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

359
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,000
You can do it! You can do it!

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, I can cheer you on while lying down.

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,700
Standing up or lying down doesn't make a difference.

362
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,500
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

363
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm going to sleep.

364
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
You can do it! You can do it!

365
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
I'll cheer you on in my dreams.

366
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
Nana-chan is the best!

367

Sister Na Na! You came to work!

371
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
I've been off for almost a week.

372
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,500
The cafe is busy,

373
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
and Hongdou is occupied with the homestay's renovations.

374
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
I can't let her cover my shifts forever.

375
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Great. I miss you so much.

376
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,000
Sister Na Na, do you want dough fritters?

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,800
I already had breakfast.

378
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,300
Get to work. Okay.

379
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Na Na, you're back!

380
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,300
Morning, Granny Xiuying and Granny Caiyun.

381
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,000
How's your family?

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
I didn't go home.

383
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,000
A friend of mine came to visit me,

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,600
so I hung out with her for a few days.

385
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,700
Granny Caiyun,

386
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
I hope you weren't exhausted.

387
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
I wasn't.

388
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
I've just been taking photos with them.

389
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,100
Taking pictures isn't as easy as sweeping the floors.

390
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,200
You've become internet celebrities now.

391
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
What's an internet celebrity?

392
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Someone who's very popular on the internet.

393
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,000
She means you're popular and liked by many.

394
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,200
- That's great.
- We're popular.

395
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,100
It's good to be popular.

396
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,000
We'll get to work.

397
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,300
Okay.

398

♫ <i>The sky is turning bright without a sound</i> ♫

400
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,400
- Brother!
- Brother.

401
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
Dropping people off?

402
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,800
Lanzhi, you're back too.

403
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,200
Brother, is everything all right back home?

404
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, we're good.

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,400
I'll drop these folks off.

406
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Come over for a chat tonight.

407
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
- Okay.
- Sure.

408
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,800
- Take care.
- See you.

409
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
See you, Uncle.

410
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
Bye-bye.

411
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,700
Dad, there really are more tourists around.

412
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,000
Do you think my brother really succeeded?

413
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
There's no way he did everything alone.

414
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,200
The government probably played the greatest role.

415
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,100
If you can't talk nicely, then don't.

416
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,200
You sound so mean.

417
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,700
A'Yuan, am I mean?

418
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,600
Yes.

419
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Good.

420
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Truth is hard on the ears.

421
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Be careful.

422
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,900
The bathrooms have been renovated

423
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,600
according to your last request.

424
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,600
However, we want to achieve simplicity in design,

425
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,000
so there are fewer decorative elements.

426
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Hence, we need to accentuate the room

427
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,800
with soft furnishings.

428
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,400
For example, the sofa may need some cushions.

429
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
The dining table might need a tablecloth as well.

430
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,000
- Hongdou!
- As for the beds...

431
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I'll leave you two alone. Thank you.

432
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Come home for lunch.

433
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,100
It's still early.

434
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,300
My dad, my aunty, and A'Yuan are back.

435
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,000
You haven't met my aunty yet. She's dying to see you.

436
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
What's wrong?

437
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,500
Hold on.

438
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,700
Is this an official meeting with your parents?

439
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,600
Sort of.

440
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,700
Do you think it's too abrupt?

441
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,500
It is.

442
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,200
Most importantly,

443
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm not mentally prepared,

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
and I don't have any experience.

445
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,500
What experience does this require?

446
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,000
You've met my dad, and you know A'Yuan.

447
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,800
My aunty is a pretty nice person.

448
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,600
She's just an ordinary housewife,

449
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
but she may ask you quite a few questions.

450
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,500
Let me make a call first.

451
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,000
I need to call my sister and my mom.

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,600
We'll have a video conference.

453
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
Conference?

454
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
The first time I went to your brother-in-law's house,

455
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
I just went there straight from work.

456
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
I bought some fruit with me.

457
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,300
They're just curious about you

458
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
and your family.

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,300
Well, is there anything else I should take note of?

460
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,400
During the meal, praise the food.

461
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Don't rush to wash the dishes.

462
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
That's unrefined.

463
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>Don't keep fiddling with your phone.</i>

464
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,200
<i>Listen more and talk less.</i>

465
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,600
Keep smiling.

466
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,700
Drink tea often.

467
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,000
Got it, what else?

468
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,600
<i>Nothing more. It's not that complicated.</i>

469
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,400
Go forth, Pikachu!

470
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
All right, Bulbasaur.

471
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
Let's go. We should buy some fruit.

472
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,900
I've already bought them.

473
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,200
You just need to come home with me.

474
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,500
Don't be nervous.

475
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
I'm not nervous.

476
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
You even had a video conference.

477
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
I was just filling them in.

478
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,500
Filling them in?

479
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,400
How about feeling me?

480
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,800
Are they still cooking?

481
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't worry. Just sit here.

482
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Sit down.

483
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
My mom cares about you.

484
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
She was convinced that my brother didn't want a girlfriend

485
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
because he wanted to become a monk.

486
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
Why?

487
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,100
My brother had a friend who had a grown kid,

488
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,300
but he suddenly chose to become a monk.

489
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,800
Every time he sees us, he'll say, "Amitabha."

490
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Really?

491
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
It's true.

492
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
The fish is ready.

493
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,700
All done! Put it here.

494
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,800
Move some of the dishes over.

495
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
Be careful, it's hot.

496
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,300
Aunty, stop cooking.

497
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,200
We've got too many dishes.

498
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
There isn't more.

499
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
This is all.

500
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
I asked A'Yao about your favorite foods,

501
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,700
but he said you eat everything.

502
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
I do eat everything.

503
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, she's not a picky eater.

504
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,200
- She eats everything.
- That's nice.

505
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,600
These are all her signature dishes.

506
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, my cooking isn't great.

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
I could only help her out.

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah. He was so nice today.

509
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,600
He even offered to help me.

510
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Usually, he wouldn't even care

511
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,200
if the soy sauce bottle was tipped over.

512
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Luckily, A'Yao and A'Yuan don't take after him.

513
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Hongdou's still here. Don't embarrass me.

514
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,300
All right. Let's not talk about him today.

515
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,800
Come on. Dig in.

516
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,100
Let's eat.

517
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
Hongdou, eat up.

518
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,900
Okay.

519
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,000
Slow down.

520
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
You're like a hungry ghost.

521
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm still growing.

522
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,800
Come on.

523
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,500
Thank you, Uncle.

524
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,100
Hongdou, A'Yuan apoke about you at home.

525
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,800
He said a really nice sister moved into the courtyard.

526
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,100
He wronged you, but you didn't even get mad.

527
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Mom! Why did you bring this up?

528
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,800
She's not talking bad about you.

529
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Granny always tells me on the phone

530
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,300
about Hongdou accompanying her at her stall

531
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,800
or Hongdou chatting with her.

532
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,600
Hongdou even bought her toys.

533
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,200
She loves you to bits. Right, Mom?

534
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah.

535
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,200
She phoned us the other day to say

536
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,800
you two started dating.

537
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
All of us were thrilled!

538
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,300
- Hongdou, here's a toast to you.
- Thank you, Aunty.

539
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
I wish you and A'Yao all the best for your careers and relationship.

540
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Good luck!

541
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Aunty and Uncle, thank you.

542
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,400
Don't worry.

543
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,600
I'll treat him well.

544
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
You said this yourself.

545
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
If you treat me poorly, I'll call my aunty.

546
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,800
If Hongdou treats you poorly, reflect on yourself.

547
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
How can you tell on her?

548
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Exactly.

549
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
That's right.

550
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
She won't treat you poorly for no reason.

551
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
Yeah.

552
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm just like spilled water you guys don't care about, right?

553
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Watch it.

554
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Isn't that right?

555
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,700
This water has drenched me.

556
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,600
Let's eat.

557
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,700
Have some vegetables.

558
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,200
Thank you.

559
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Eat whatever you like.

560
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,300
If you don't like it, leave it.

561
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,700
Okay.

562
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,400
- Granny, have some too.
- Do you want fish balls?

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,200
Let me get you a fish ball.

564
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Let's all get it for her.

565
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,500
Eat mine, Granny!

566
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay.

567
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
♫ <i>Slim and elegant</i> ♫

568
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
♫ <i>My baby, time to sleep</i> ♫

569
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
I should help them.

570
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,800
Sit down.

571
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Drink your tea.

572
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,500
Hongdou, the fruits are ready.

573
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Have some.

574
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Lanzhi,

575
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm going to visit Grandpa Yang.

576
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Going to drink?

577
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Nope.

578
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
Only a little.

579
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Get going.

580
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Hongdou, enjoy yourself here.

581
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,500
- Okay, Uncle.
- I'm heading out.

582
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,499
He doesn't know any of our neighbors in Kunming.

583
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
He must've been yearning for friends.

584
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,500
Every time we come back here, he goes missing at night.

585
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,600
He's always visiting people.

586
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,200
Uncle!

587
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,300
Look at this house.

588
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,600
How wonderful.

589
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,900
All your furniture is new.

590
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Deqing and his wife are filial as well.

591
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Why are you still clamoring to move out?

592
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Why are you making a fuss?

593
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
- A'Qing.
- Uncle.

594
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
How are you doing in school?

595
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,200
Not bad.

596
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,800
Have you decided on which university you want to attend?

597
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Not yet, Uncle.

598
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,800
Ask A'Yao to gather a list of good schools.

599
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
- Okay.
- Off you go.

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Tell your mom to stop cooking.

601
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,700
It's enough.

602
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,000
Call your dad over for drinks.

603
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
- Okay.
- Don't go.

604
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
He better not show his face here.

605
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
This scoundrel.

606
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,200
All right.

607
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,400
We won't let him join us.

608
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,600
Uncle, come on.

609
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,500
Let's drink.

610
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,200
I haven't had a drink with you in a while.

611
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,300
Why did Deqing ask you to come over?

612
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,400
He didn't say a word.

613
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,900
A'Yao got himself a girlfriend.

614
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Lanzhi hasn't met her yet.

615
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,600
We came to see her.

616
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,800
A girlfriend?

617
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
Where's she from?

618
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,500
From Beijing.

619
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,400
His girlfriend bought

620
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,000
the homestay under construction.

621
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,600
In the past,

622
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
he raised hell in the village with Xiao Huang.

623
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,000
Now, there's one more person with him.

624
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
They only come together

625
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,600
to create a mess of the village.

626
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,100
This place has lost all peace and quiet!

627
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,300
You're just unaware.

628
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,000
It's like they poked a hornets' nest.

629
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,200
Tourists are flooding this place.

630
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,500
Isn't it nice to have more tourists?

631
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,700
On my way here,

632
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,000
I saw many stalls set up in front of the houses.

633
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
They were selling tie-dyed products and scarves.

634
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
Yeah.

635
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
They're all retailing products.

636
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, who'll farm the lands?

637
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What will we eat?

638
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We'll still need to farm the lands.

639
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,800
They just have another source of income.

640
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,500
Income?

641
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
What income?

642
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,200
Money has filled their heads.

643
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,800
Absurd.

644
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
Uncle.

645
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,400
When I was little, my brother fell sick.

646
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,800
We had no money and had to borrow from you.

647
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,200
You didn't have enough savings, so you helped us borrow money from others.

648
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,000
It took us a lot of effort to scrape together the money.

649
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
However, medicine wasn't developed back then.

650
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,800
We spent loads of money on my brother,

651
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
but he still didn't get cured.

652
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,700
When I grew up, I only remembered my family's poverty.

653
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,500
Life back then was so much worse.

654
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,300
Education wasn't compulsory.

655
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,100
We even had to scrimp and save to pay for school.

656
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,600
You made Deqing take your money

657
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,900
and drag me to school.

658
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,300
I had disappointing grades,

659
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,600
but at least I finished junior high.

660
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,400
I'm not well-educated.

661
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
My first wife and I...

662
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,900
wanted A'Yao to study hard

663
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,700
and leave this village.

664
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,900
He's just like his mom.

665
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,100
He's smart and went to university.

666
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,200
He even clinched a well-paid job.

667
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,000
My children were so close to escaping a life of farming,

668
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
but he insisted on coming back.

669
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
In the first two years after he returned,

670
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
I made life hell for him.

671
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,800
The Bai Family's tie-dye workshop

672
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,400
was going broke, but he insisted on taking it over.

673
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
I stopped him at the gates and yelled at him.

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,900
The police officers even came over!

675
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
So embarrassing!

676
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,200
But at that time,

677
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,900
I'd willingly embarrass myself for his future.

678
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,800
After that,

679
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
Lanzhi told me this.

680
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
Every generation does better than the one before.

681
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,900
We aren't well-educated,

682
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,900
but A'Yao is a university graduate with broader visions.

683
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,200
He doesn't see things the way we do.

684
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,800
We have to trust him

685
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,200
and seek his advice in troubling times.

686
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Uncle, a majority of your peers were farmers

687
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,600
and had little money.

688
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,200
My peers can work in the cities.

689
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,500
Life has become much better.

690
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,000
However, the children and the elderly

691
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,600
are left behind at home.

692
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,900
Look at the present situation.

693
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,500
If we have more tourists,

694
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,200
families can stay together at home

695
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,800
and earn more money for a better life.

696
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Isn't that wonderful?

697
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Siping, what do you think will happen

698
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
to our village in the future?

699
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,500
I don't know.

700
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,100
I dare not imagine the future.

701
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,000
A few years ago, no one would've thought about

702
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,200
selling flowers on a livestream.

703
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,300
Delivery services are so fast.

704
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,600
We don't even need to carry cash now.

705
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,600
Uncle, a person can't manage the lives of another generation.

706
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
The world out there is changing rapidly.

707
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,600
We should alter our thinking for the next generation

708
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
and the generation after that.

709
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,200
Don't you agree?

710
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
Impressive, Uncle.

711
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Granny, I'm leaving.

712
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,200
I want to take a flower with me.

713
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,100
I'll remove the thorns for you.

714
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
Here you go. I'll send them over to you tomorrow when they're ready.

715
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,300
<i>Hongdou, wait!</i>

716
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,800
This is a gift from me and A'Yaos dad.

717
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
- Here, take it.
- No, I can't.

718
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
I can't take this. Aunty, I really can't accept this.

719
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
This is our first meeting.

720
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
You can't reject our red packet.

721
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,700
There's no need, Aunty. This is too much.

722
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,400
It isn't much. Take it.

723
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,500
Just take it.

724
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,400
- A'Yao.
- Yeah?

725
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Once you walk Hongdou home, pick up your dad.

726
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,600
He must've drunk a lot.

727
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Okay.

728
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,100
Aunty, thank you for today.

729
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,400
The food was delicious.

730
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
I'll teach A'Yao the dishes you enjoyed.

731
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,600
Get him to cook for you.

732
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Let's go.

733
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Good night.

734
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,600
Bye-bye.

735
