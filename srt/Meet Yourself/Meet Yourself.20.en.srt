00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,780
<i>[Episode 20]</i>

3
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,919
Truth be told, I can't cook difficult dishes.

4
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,460
All I know are a few simple recipes.

5
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,020
Granny, let's eat out.

6
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,819
I'll take you to Galsang Flower Restaurant for braised chicken.

7
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,639
We've already finished cooking.

8
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,920
Why do we have to eat out?

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,259
Something smells great! The fragrance has wafted all the way to the yard.

10
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,640
Didn't you go to the hospital?

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,800
Why are you back?

12
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,720
Aunty Feng didn't allow me to stay. She insisted that I come home.

13
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,039
What delicious food did you cook for Granny?

14
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,720
Take a look.

15
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,740
Are you trying to poison her with a meal?

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,000
Scram if you aren't eating.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
Stop blabbering nonsense.

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,140
Listen up.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,060
This is my hometown recipe.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,619
It doesn't look impressive, but it tastes pretty good.

21
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,760
Try it.

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm more confident about this braised fish.

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
How is it? Tasty, right?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,020
Did you add vinegar?

25
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,900
It's to get rid of the raw fish smell.

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,640
How much did you add?

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,880
About the same as the soy sauce.

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,439
Don't people in Yunnan like sour food?

29
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,719
You have sour chicken feet

30
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,239
and sour papaya fish.

31
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes.

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,720
I love sour food.

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
I'll try it.

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,699
Not bad. It tastes good.

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,560
- Right?
- Here.

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,860
You can have some.

37
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,079
Granny, isn't that too much?

38
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,380
Here, eat more.

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,079
Dig in.

40
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,299
Okay. I'll eat.

41
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Delicious.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,499
I should have ordered braised chicken from Galsang Restaurant for lunch.

43
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,759
It wasn't that bad.

44
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,599
The meat was chunky,

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,279
but it tasted decent with the starch coating.

46
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,299
Don't add dark soy sauce to vegetables.

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Light soy sauce and oyster sauce are enough.

48
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,479
Is it sour? Let me try one.

49
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,079
It's too sour. Stop, don't eat them.

50
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,460
It's pretty sour. Give it another try.

51
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,020
We should stop here.

52
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,440
The grapes won't turn sweeter just because we finish more.

53
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,619
The green grocer said they aren't sour.

54
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,080
I tried a few, and they didn't taste sour.

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,460
- Were they from the same bunch?
- Nope.

56
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,459
You have your reason.

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,099
They aren't from the same branch, and they may not even be from the same plant.

58
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,640
Are we going to throw them away?

59
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,239
We can make jam or wine.

60
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,440
All roads lead to Rome.

61
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,300
Do you like plums?

62
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,220
I do.

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,960
How about we host a courtyard bonding activity.

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Bonding activity?

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
We'll pick fruits at the orchard.

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,400
We can eat while picking.

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,780
What about the fee for each person?

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,279
Don't worry. It's on me, and I'll even provide lunch.

69
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,479
Sounds good. A boss's treat is always welcome.

70
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,540
When should we have this?

71
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,059
There's no time like the present.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,640
- How about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,539
- Do you have something on?
- Nope.

74
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,619
It's settled then.

75
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,080
Na Na has a shift at the cafe tomorrow.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,240
I'll give her a day off.

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,559
Boss, you're really generous.

78
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,600
- Nice.
- Come on.

79
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,840
Why is it scalding hot?

80
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,140
Sorry.

81
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,980

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,279

Take note of this.

We'll be closed tomorrow for a bonding activity.

What bonding activity?

117
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,080
The courtyard's tenants will be picking fruits at the orchard.

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,060
We can eat while we pick. It's on A'Yao.

119
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,399
Really?

120
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,700
That's great.

121
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,400
Chairman Xie really deserves my admiration.

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,020
Well...

123
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,859
Remember to wear old clothes tomorrow with long sleeves.

124
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:38,720
The orchard is filled with mud and branches.

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,199
Don't forget to use sunscreen.

126
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,199
Inform the rest.

127
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,199
Got it. I'll create a group chat to let them know.

- Sure.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,080
By the way, we're picking fruits at the orchard tomorrow.

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,819
You're going to the orchard?

136
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,560
Everyone is going to have fun.

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,780
Everyone?

138
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,219
Does that include me?

139
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,240
I... I'll pass. Have fun.

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,040
I'm not going.

141
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,899
Why aren't you joining us? Do you have classes tomorrow?

142
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,319
That reminds me.

143
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,140
I discovered a miracle today.

144
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,459
What is it?

145
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,739
Didn't you tell me that the kindergarten's accordion teacher left?

146
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,159
Guess what happened today.

147
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,419
I just ended class, and a teacher could suddenly play the accordion!

148
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,860
Isn't it a miracle?

149
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,160
Wait.

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,479
This has nothing to do with me.

151
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,039
It was Brother's idea. Take this up with him.

152
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,000
I know you aren't the mastermind.

153
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Why did he do this?

154
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,059
Why can't he be frank with me? He even pulled off this farce.

155
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,580
What's with him?

156
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,300
Does he think I'm pitiful?

157
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,120
Is he trying to offer me some affirmation?

158
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,400
I don't need that.

159
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,360
Hey.

160
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,920
What do you mean by that?

161
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,980
What's that about finding you pitiful?

162
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,500
You locked yourself up in your room and made a mess in there.

163
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,079
You don't write any songs, and your mental condition was deteriorating.

164
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,599
Everyone was worried about you.

165
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,420
That's why Brother came up with this idea

166
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,740
to help you get some fresh air.

167
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,339
I'm an artist of sorts.

168
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,699
I ended up teaching kids how to sing.

169
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,500
H-How can I refresh my mind?

170
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,920
Where can I even end up?

171
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
What's wrong with teaching children?

172
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,719
They have the purest minds.

173
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,560
They don't care about your age, income, or social status.

174
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,220
The only feel that Mr. Hu is amazing.

175
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,140
Can you drop your ego and stop being utilitarian?

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,960
As adults, we have tons to learn from children.

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,319
Keep your mouth shut.

178
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,040
Get out of the way!

179

Brother!

Na Na!

186
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
What are you carrying?

187
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,000
A tent. When we're tired, we can play cards on it.

188
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,120
Mr. Hu!

189
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,800
Why did you bring your guitar along?

190
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,680
If I'm in the mood,

191
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,300
I can sing a song.

192
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,180
Brother,

193
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,080
aren't you going to stop him?

194
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,239
No harm bringing it along.

195
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,300
We can relax if we're tired.

196
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,340
You're such a conman!

197
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't come to me for help again.

198
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,800
I don't want to play a part in your wicked deeds.

199
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,160
I'll head to the fields first!

200
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,520
What did she say?

201
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,060
Play a part in wicked deeds?

202
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,919
What did she mean?

203
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,640
What is she saying?

204
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,479
What does she mean?

205
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,100
What's she saying?

206
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,439
The orchard is up ahead.

207
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,359
Please enjoy the plum harvesting today

208
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,520
and experience daily life in the countryside.

209
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,400
What's wrong with him?

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,540
He's lost his marbles.

211
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,640
I can hear you!

212
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
His ears are in tip-top condition.

213
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,000
Come on.

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,399
Mr. Hu, why did you bring your guitar over for harvesting?

215
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,080
I'm insane.

216
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,040
Na Na even brought a tent.

217
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
Let's find a space to set up the tent.

218
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,679
You can leave your stuff inside.

219
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,080
When you're tired, you can take a break in there.

220
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,580
I didn't scam you guys.

221
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,799
You're picking fruits at the orchard.

222
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,419
You can eat while picking.

223
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,180
Lunch is on me.

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
It's really true.

225
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,340
You're manipulating words.

226
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,319
Treat this as a fun experience. Rest if you're tired.

227
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,700
Are these for us?

228
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,839
- Yes.
- That's right.

229
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,459
- All right, I'll choose one.
- Yes.
- Okay.

230
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,980
My head is pretty big.

231
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,739
Thank you so much! It's such a scorching day.

232
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,519
You must be here to help me

233
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,819
after hearing about my family situation from A'Yao.

234
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,599
You've never worked at an orchard before.

235
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,059
Don't exhaust yourself.

236
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,919
- Just do your best with picking them.
- We can do it.

237
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,940
Damai and I want to have a try as well.

238
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,959
Thank you.

239
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,480
All right. Aunty Feng, I'll pick plums with you.

240
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,879
Brother will manage the folks he brought over.

241
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,100
- Pass me the basket.
- Don't mind me, Aunty Feng.

242
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,959
I'll manage this bunch.

243
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,760
- Okay, thank you so much.
- It's no big deal.

244
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,040
- Thank you!
- Let's go!

245
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,160
I'm so considerate. I even prepared sun protection sleeves for everyone.

246
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,319
Xu Hongdou, the pink is for you.

247
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,240
You can use the pink one.

248
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,680
So, your bag isn't filled with snacks.

249
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,140
You're free to eat the fruits here.

250
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,540
There's no need to bring snacks.

251
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,780
In addition to the sleeves,

252
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,759
I also prepared sun protection clothing

253
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,239
for kind and gorgeous ladies like you.

254
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,480
I really don't want you to be sunburned.

255
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
Pick one.

256
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,840
How nice of you.

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,320
Here, you can have the last one. It's the prettiest.

258
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,679
- Hongdou, let's do it together.
- Okay.

259
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,840
Don't by shy. Take it.

260
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,139
Don't you have work today?

261
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,320
Aren't I working right now? I'm helping a villager in need.

262
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,519
Well, I'll set up this tent first.

263
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,220
Mr. Hu, do you need me to put the guitar in the tent?

264
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,400
Old Hu, let's go.

265
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
Old Hu, here.

266
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,800
Try this. It's sweet.

267
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,500
I don't get it.

268
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,800
These guys are so sour.

269
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,020
What's the point of picking these?

270
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,460
Here's something you don't know.

271
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,959
Such plums aren't meant to be eaten immediately.

272
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,719
They are primarily used to make alcohol,

273
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,860
candied fruits, and dried fruits.

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,700
They aren't supposed to be eaten immediately, but you asked me to try one.

275
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,339
I took a bite earlier, but I can't be the only victim.

276
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,260
Old Ma! Mr. Hu!

277
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,280
Hurry up!

278
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,079
You two are the slowest. All you do is chat.

279
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,919
What? Who's slow?

280
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,239
Haven't you heard the story of The Tortoise and the Hare?

281
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:02,079
Endurance makes the man.

282
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
Let's see who'll be the real victor at the end.

283
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,719
Bring it on.

284
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,120
Do you really think young ladies with healthy lifestyles

285
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,420
aren't a match for middle-aged men

286
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,879
who drink every day and lack exercise?

287
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,340
Who are you calling a middle-aged man?

288
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,780
Don't you know I am a youth?

289
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,959
I don't see the robustness of youth in you.

290
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,860
A gust of wind would knock you off your feet.

291
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,760
Xiao Huang, you should unite people.

292
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,039
First of all, women should be united.

293
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,840
We have to dispute false accusations that aren't logical with facts.

294
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,579
False accusations? What false accusations?

295
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:38,699
Old Ma, do me justice.

296
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,819
What false accusations?

297
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,960
When did I do such a thing?

298
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,400
Xiao Huang is right.

299
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,880
Hu Youyu, you're the black sheep of the group.

300
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,139
The "Yu" in my name describes someone skilled.

301
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,280
With a name like "Ma," you're the real black sheep.

302
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,639
A joke with homophones?

303
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,220
Not bad.

304
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,100
Have some water.

305
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,379
Hydrate yourselves.

306
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,040
Thank you.

307
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,239
Take it easy. There's no rush. It's fine to rest.

308
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,460
Is Uncle Chang the only one caring for these few mu of plum fields?
<i>("Mu" is a unit of measurement for land)</i>

309
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,620
Yes. Aunty Feng has hypertension.

310
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,759
Her heart is weak, so she can't work in the orchard.

311
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,799
Uncle Chang waters the trees, fertilizes the orchard,

312
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,900
and sprays pesticide all by himself.

313
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,119
He even planted scallions and potatoes.

314
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,340
In all, it's about seven mu of land.

315
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,939
After working in the fields, he'd cut reeds to make brooms

316
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,319
or collect corn husks for baskets.

317
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,679
He has never rested.

318
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,000
No wonder he fell sick.

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,840
Didn't he hire any helpers?

320
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,319
It costs money to hire helpers.

321
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,959
For example, wages are expensive for plum picking.

322
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,159
It'll cost ¥80 per person.

323
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,499
Their productivity would still differ.

324
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,739
Their meals even have to be included.

325
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,719
The villagers know about their situation,

326
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,679
so everyone will help out when they have time.

327
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,840
This is pretty engaging.

328
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,200
It's nice to experience the joy of harvesting.

329
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
They sure have it hard.

330
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,380
In short, let's do our best!

331
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,919
- Do our best!
- Do our best!
- Thank you.

332
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,040
Do our best.

♫ <i>Stars in the sky</i> ♫

334

♫ <i>Picking mushrooms</i> ♫

342
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,800
A'Feng, food is here!

343
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,899
They must be hungry.

344
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,860
Have you stopped properly?

345
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,840
- You guys must be hungry.
- Be careful.

346
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,500
Why are you here?

347
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,920
Baoping doesn't know how to drive an electronic tricycle.

348
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,319
Who else can I get to come over?

349
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,699
A'Gui cooked everything here.

350
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
I only helped her a little.

351
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,740
I'm a bad cook.

352
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,340
These are just simple dishes anyway.

353
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,220
- They aren't anything special.
- You really cook tasty food.

354
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,379
That's unprecedented.

355
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,980
Did I just hear a compliment for me?

356
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,300
You're too good at self-praise.

357
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,540
What else can we say about you?

358
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,519
Enough with you two.

359
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,200
You've been quibbling since you were kids. We're already so old.

360
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,079
A'Gui's mouth is really like a firing cannon.

361
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,919
It's only extinguished when you meet A'Feng.

362
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,800
She has a heart condition, so I let her have her way.

363
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
Why is the food so delicious?

364
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,040
It's amazing.

365
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,639
Does anyone want more rice?

366
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:56,140
Damai, give me your bowl.

367
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,420
Here you go.

368
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,800
- Have some spare ribs.
- Aunty Feng, save it.

369
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,399
- You're giving us too much!
- You should rest! We don't need more.

370
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,260
We can take more by ourselves. You should eat.

371
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,419
Yes, you should enjoy these.

372
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,499
Aunty Feng, where are my mom and Aunty A'Gui?

373
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:10,740
They're picking plums over there.

374
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,720
Enjoy your meal.

375
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,299
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

376
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,320
Don't worry. Eat your fill.

377
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,140
I've been working the entire morning.

378
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,540
I've lost all will to move.

379
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,340
This elderly couple is already so old.

380
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,520
How can they be so energetic?

381
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,900
Once you have a target, you'll be motivated.

382
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,679
Once you're motivated, you'll have endless energy.

383
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,780
Life may be tough, but you'll find joy in it.

384
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,040
I'll dumb it down.

385
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,260
This is so that their son, Xie Qiang, can live an easier life.

386
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,179
Why else would they work so hard for? Right?

387
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,779
They shouldn't harp on this.

388
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,479
Their children's fortunes are beyond them.

389
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,039
It'll be great if they can accept that.

390
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,240
This is just how their generation is.

391
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
Yeah.

392
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,639
That's why grassroots efforts are so meaningful.

393
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,679
We can truly help them relieve their burdens.

394
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,940
Every person we help counts.

395
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,020
Xinxin, eat this.

396
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,740
I have enough.

397
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,299
The ribs are amazing.

398
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,799
Tasty, right? Have some more.

399
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,280
I still have a piece here. I'll finish this first.

400
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,340
Why are you sitting here?

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,360
It's breezy here.

402
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,979
- You must be tired.
- I'm fine.

403
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,040
Well, what's on your mind?

404
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,119
I'm thinking about Aunty Feng.

405
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,740
Aunty Feng?

406
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,860
Her life is truly tough.

407
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,280
No one said it was a lie.

408
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,880
The pressures of society are giving everyone a hard time.

409
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,540
That's different.

410
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,540
As long as there's room to make choices, life can't be tough.

411
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,840
At most, it's hard.

412
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,580
Don't they mean the same thing?

413
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,079
No, they don't.

414
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,599
Look at us. We're ordinary folks. Our lives are hard.

415
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,420
We're trying our best to cross a river with stones. Right?

416
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,760
We see folks enjoying hotpot

417
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,679
and singing on a ship passing by.

418
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,720
Their lives seem like a breeze.

419
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,020
As for Aunty Feng and Uncle Chang, they're trying to cross the river slowly.

420
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,900
As they go on their way, a rising tide surges out of the blue.

421
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
They're swept away by the flood of fate.

422
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
Their lives are in turbulence.

423
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,840
They're struggling to stay afloat,

424
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
but they're clueless about where they'll end up.

425
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,060
Your analogy

426
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,220
makes their lives seem even more arduous.

427
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,240
It's arduous to begin with.

428
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,180
Don't you think so?

429
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,480
I think...

430
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,520
They're managing fine.

431
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,340
Do you think they're doing fine with such a life?

432
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,779
As you said, they've been through tough times.

433
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,480
Right now, it's just hard for them.

434
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,520
Are our standards of measurement different?

435
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,840
Well, what are your standards based on?

436
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,980
Is everyone placed on the same scale as you compare who has a tougher life?

437
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,320
Easy, hard, and tough.

438
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Indeed, there's a universal standard recognized by everyone.

439
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,740
However, everyone's starting line differs.

440
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,699
Some starting lines are the goals of others.

441
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:40,080
If they don't live with a silver spoon,

442
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,180
it's torture for them.

443
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,620
They'll really feel miserable.

444
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,220
Everyone views hardship differently.

445
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,700
So, how can you compare them on the same scale?

446
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Regardless of your current position,

447
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,220
there will always be someone suffering more than you.

448
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,020
There will also be others enjoying a better life.

449
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,400
As humans, we can only assess ourselves

450
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,180
and use our current selves as a benchmark.

451
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,960
Compare our past and future selves,

452
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,040
as well as ourselves at different moments in time.

453
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,780
Are you saying that the present is Aunty Feng's good days?

454
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,500
She has already overcome the toughest chapter of her life.

455
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,320
So, her life will only get better.

456
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,380
Have fruits after your meal.

457
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,419
A'Yao enlisted the help of the agriculture live streaming.

458
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,360
In one night, we sold 20,000 catties.

459
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,860
Xiao Huang introduced this project.

460
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,720
A'Yao sealed the deal.

461
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,160
The pre-orders for our shop have hit 2,000 catties.

462
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,550
The rest were taken away by the truck.

463
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,940
That's great.

464
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,739
In the past, these wouldn't have brought in enough money,

465
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:45,500
- or they would've been left to waste.
- Exactly.

466
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,099
The past is the past.

467
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:50,900
Everyone has hard days.

468
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,040
My family was no different.

469
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Dayang and Xiao Xi enrolled in universities one after the other.

470
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,439
Their daily expenses and tuition fees

471
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:02,560
had Zeqing and me scrambling in a frenzy.

472
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,900
Mom!

473
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,599
We're done eating. Can you help with clearing up?

474
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,820
We're going to pick plums.

475
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,220
I'll come back and join you later.

476
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,900
It's too heavy.

477
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,300
Let me do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

478
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,539
Let's carry it together. Let's do it together.

479
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,100
Slow down.

480
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,800
Take a break.

481
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,200
A'Feng.

482
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,719
What are you doing?

483
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,919
It's for Brother Chang. It's for the patient, not you.

484
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,420
Don't think of him as a patient. He's not suffering from a serious illness.

485
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,620
He fainted from anemia! How isn't this a serious issue?

486
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,140
So inexplicable.

487
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,480
I don't even know where to start commenting.

488
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,859
You're rearing chickens, but you don't bear to eat them.

489
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,640
So, you sold every single one.

490
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
You can make money from the fields

491
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,980
and from part-time jobs.

492
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,320
You cleared your debts ages ago.

493
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,060
I really don't get it.

494
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Why do you have to live so frugally?

495
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,199
We're saving money for old age.

496
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,340
We're not desperate for money!

497
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,699
You claim that you're saving for old age.

498
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,920
Here's something to think about.

499
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,400
You have to be alive to use the money you saved for old age.

500
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,119
If both of you ruin your health now,

501
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,420
you'll have to spend money on hospital bills.

502
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,800
Don't you care about the money for medical expenses?

503
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,040
You're so clever, but you can never see the logic in this.

504
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,539
Why are you crying?

505
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,760
I didn't say anything harsh.

506
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not.

507
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
It's the wind.

508
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,379
I see. It's because of the wind.

509
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,780
Right now, you're standing in a windy spot.

510
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,660
Come on.

511
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,020
I'll wipe the wind away for you.

512
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,660
Let me have a look.

513
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,359
I'll wipe away the wind. Wind, begone.

514
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,659
Stop picking plums. Let's take a short break.

515
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:03,180
Come on.

516
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,580
I didn't manage to thank you.

517
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,560
You drove me to the hospital

518
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,860
and came to help me today.

519
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,640
In the past, I was mean to you. I'm sorry.

520
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,220
So, you're admitting it.

521
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,580
You were really mean to me.

522
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,420
A'Feng,

523
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,440
we've been sisters for over 30 years.

524
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,080
Don't you know me well?

525
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,600
I don't think before I speak. I have no filter.

526
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,660
Most of the villagers have been pissed off by me,

527
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,560
but I don't harbor ill intentions.

528
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,460
You always say I'm a bragger.

529
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,620
You're right.

530
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,060
Sometimes, I do enjoy bragging,

531
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,540
but there's a reason for it.

532
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,259
In the past, my family was really poor.

533
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,139
We were one of the poorest in the village, even if we weren't the worst.

534
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,340
Right?

535
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,320
We could only build a new house after Dayang found a job after his graduation.

536
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,160
I know.

537
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,779
Now matter how much I bragged,

538
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,759
I never did it before you.

539
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,320
Isn't that right?

540
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,620
You know me well.

541
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,600
My pretty pants always hide worn-out undies.

542
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,999
You should always speak your mind to me.

543
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,860
How would I know if you don't say a word?

544
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,100
You're intelligent, but I have a one-track mind.

545
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,220
Don't you think I treat you well?

546
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,340
If I harvest a pumpkin from our fields, I'll definitely give half to you.

547
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,480
Whenever you harvested scallions, potatoes,

548
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,120
apples, and plums, didn't I come to help every time?

549
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,520
I know you treat me well.

550
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,279
Don't use such honeyed words on me. I can't tell if you're lying.

551
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,960
You've already said that we've been sisters for over 30 years.

552
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,719
You know what kind of person I am.

553
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:18,699
I'd rather stay silent than lie. Right?

554
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,340
That's true.

555
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,240
Last time, you even said I was jealous of you.

556
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
I was blabbering in a fit of anger.

557
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,440
I am jealous of you.

558
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,719
- Why?
- Why?

559
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:35,100
Dayang and Xiao Xi are so outstanding.

560
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,160
I didn't do anything wicked,

561
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,020
but my life is filled with misery.

562
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,880
I lost my daughter when she was just a teenager.

563
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,340
Now, I only have one son left.

564
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm worried.

565
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I do whatever I can to fulfill his wishes. Right?

566
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,799
He finally found a job.

567
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,420
Being the guard of a warehouse was all right.

568
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,740
If he needed more money, I would send him money.

569
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,940
I never expected him to steal.

570
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,700
I didn't bring him up well,

571
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
so he ended up in jail.

572
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,679
It's been so long.

573
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,319
I'm sure he learned his lesson. Right?

574
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,220
He's become a good man.

575
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,840
But once a man makes a mistake, everyone will despise him for it.

576
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,160
No one in our village will look out for him.

577
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,519
If anyone loses something,

578
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,619
they'll immediately think he's the culprit. Isn't that right?

579
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Well... That's likely.

580
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,039
So, my husband and I are trying to make more money

581
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,420
to pay the down payment for a house in the city.

582
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,500
He can be a driver or a grocer. He can just manage a small business.

583
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,160
He just can't stay here.

584
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,000
A'Feng, your life is too tough.

585
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,800
For your whole life, you've been living for your children.

586
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,779
Who doesn't live for their children?

587
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,200
Don't you?

588
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,339
When you were going to Qingdao, you packed so many bags.

589
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,000
That was enough to set up a shop.

590
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,499
That's because Dayang and Xiao Xi are in Qingdao.

591
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,040
So, I just...

592
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,520
I didn't tell you, so you don't know.

593
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,900
Dayang is really terrible.

594
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,439
Every time he invites us to Qingdao

595
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,699
to enjoy seafood and what not,

596
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,739
something will always crop up

597
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,260
when we are just about to leave.

598
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,380
This time, we already booked the flight tickets.

599
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,500
He said his superior sent him on a business trip.

600
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,720
What's wrong with a business trip? It's common, isn't it?

601
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,800
What do you know?

602
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,180
Dayang may need to go on business trips, but Xiao Xi doesn't have to.

603
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,639
She has never invited us over.

604
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,660
She's equally terrible.

605
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,360
She thinks it's better for you guys to visit Qingdao when her brother is around.

606
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
I've made up my mind.

607
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,020
If they invite me over again, I'll be hell-bent on refusing.

608
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,720
It's best if they don't come back either.

609
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,919
They're always sending us money

610
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:19,379
if it's a holiday.

611
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,039
Who cares about that money?

612
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,740
We'll just save it and return it to them when they're back.

613
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,340
That's true.

614
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,340
Don't drink this tea.

615
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,940
Look.

616
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,860
These are tea dregs!

617
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,219
Dump it out!

618
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,880
Drink mine.

619
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,620
Look.

620
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,920
Xiao Xi bought this tea for us.

621
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,579
It's high-grade tea. Expensive stuff.

622
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,460
Enough.

623
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,480
Why did I mention that terrible lass again?

624
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,059
It's fragrant!

625
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,800
It's good, right?

626
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,220
Look at my state.

627
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,180
What's there to film?

628
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,900
Are you guys tired?

629
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,500
Nope.

630
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,860
Will you come to pick plums tomorrow?

631
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,780
Kill me.

632
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,600
I won't come even if you kill me.

633
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,939
Mr. Hu!

634
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,980
He teaches us to sing!

635
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,960
Mr. Hu!

636
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,420
Hello, kiddos!

637
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,300
<i>Nice to meet you, Mr. Hu!</i>

638
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,800
Nice to meet you.

639
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,020
<i>See you, Mr. Hu!</i>

640
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,719
See you, kiddos!

641
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,179
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

642
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,080
They're so adorable.

643
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,999
Impressive, Mr. Hu.

644
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,360
You're a real teacher now.

645
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,499
In a few days, I'll apply for a proper job there.

646
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,000
A man like you? Dream on.

647
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,580
I can't join you tomorrow.

648
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,159
I have to survey a tea plantation in Fujian.

649
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,940
Have you found a partner?

650
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,119
A college classmate. I was roommates with this guy.

651
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,720
He doesn't mind my lack of money.

652
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,559
You're so annoying, but he didn't despise you.

653
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,239
You should be nice to him.

654
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,200
What's that supposed to mean?

655
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,640
As the saying goes, "A son never thinks his mother is ugly."

656
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,419
"A dog never detests its home, however shabby it is."

657
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:32,280
As the saying goes, "You're uselessly verbose."

658
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,420
A man like you will never get a full-time job.

659
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,080
But I have my students.

660
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,920
Morning, Damai.

661
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,000
Mr. Ma, you're up so early.

662
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,500
Aren't you leaving today?

663
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,960
Yes. I got up early to meditate and clear my mind.

664
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,060
I saw the lights on in your room.

665
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,840
You didn't sleep?

666
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,019
I was exhausted after the harvesting yesterday,

667
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,220
so I crashed once we came back.

668
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,000
I woke up around 3 a.m., then I kept writing.

669
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,520
How has it been going?

670
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,200
My serialization is about to end.

671
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,420
You'll be able to take a proper break.

672
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,360
I can't.

673
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Are you in a rush to get a new job?

674
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,840
It's not about looking for jobs.

675
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,600
I've decided to start a new novel.

676
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,740
Have you really made your choice?

677
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,760
Yes.

678
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,060
I think I still enjoy writing novels.

679
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,159
At times, it may feel like agony,

680
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,600
but pain is the fuel of creativity.

681
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,760
It's really hard to produce something excellent.

682
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,999
Besides, it seems like

683
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:23,119
it's hard no matter what one strives for.

684
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,760
In a proper job, I'll have to be worried about meeting the KPI.

685
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,840
So, it's fine.

686
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,040
You're right.

687
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,760
Never choose the easy path.

688
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,920
Choose the path you want to tread.

689
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,760
That's why I'm learning from you, Mr. Ma.

690
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,180
Look at you.

691
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,919
You've had successful start-ups, but you've also had failures.

692
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:50,160
You made a lot of money, but you have to start from zero again.

693
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,759
Yet, you didn't give up.

694
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:55,340
You had the courage to start on your journey again.

695
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,780
I... I'm easily bothered by the world.

696
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,560
Besides, I'm a very utilitarian person.

697
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,940
Every single day, I'm worried about uncertainties in the future.

698
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,039
People like you are fighting arduous battles.

699
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm already worn out from battling with myself.

700
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,020
It's really unbecoming.

701
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,340
How is that unbecoming?

702
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,700
On the battlefield,

703
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,360
everyone is equally worn out. Right?

704
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,520
This isn't important.

705
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,700
What matters is the ability to get back on your feet at the end.

706
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,960
Only those who get back up are real warriors.

707
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,220
So,

708
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,840
we should learn from each other.

709
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,050
Though the wind is roaring,

710
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,940
the sun will always rise.

711
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,520
We will only face good days to come.

712
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,979
- Good morning.
- Morning!

713
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,840
Is that Mr. Hu? Are you coming along?

714
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,099
I have nothing else to do.

715
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,080
I'm joining for a free lunch.

716
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,319
Let's go.

717
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,040
Na Na bought buns for us this morning.

718
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,619
- What's wrong?
- Oh, I've lost my arms.

719
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,900
Girls... are weak.

720
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,100
Mr. Hu is joining to be a clown.

721
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,999
- Let's go.
- I'll ask Xie Zhiyao if he's joining us.

722
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,200
There's no need to ask him.

723
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,380
He headed to the Old Town with Xiao Huang.

724
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,590
The owner of that unfinished homestay is back,

725
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,420
but he doesn't dare to come here.

726
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
That's for sure.

727
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,960
- That homestay will probably fall through.
- I bet.

728
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,119
What's going to happen to it?

729
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,200
They just need to find someone to take over.

730
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,440
Hurry up,

731
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,480
<i>[Thatched House]</i>
or we'll reach at lunchtime.
