Please give me your blessing

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
so I wouldn't say anything

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,510
that will upset her.

54
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,000
I want you to have a taste

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,800
of waiting eagerly.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,080
We should exchange our roles.

Mr. Gu.

63
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,080
Ms. Cheng Yu

64
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,760
just gave me a call.

65
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,760
She is willing

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
to give us a second chance

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,920
to redesign the project for her

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
but on the condition

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
that the wall

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
must be kept.

71
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
It's the same request as before.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,080
Indeed.

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,560
Not to mention

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
we proposed so many designs.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
What's the difference now?

76
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
The difference is that

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
she appointed

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,040
Jiang Xiao Ning to be the architect.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,040
Me?

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Why?

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,520
According to her,

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
only those who have suffered know how to heal.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
I...

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Mr. Gu.

85
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,280
This is a serious matter.

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
You said it earlier.

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
She's even not qualified to be

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,680
an assistant.

89
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
She can't handle the job.

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Jiang Xiao Ning.

91
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
You caused this mess.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
You earned the opportunity yourself.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,240
So tell me,

94
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,760
can you do this job?

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Can I...

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll do whatever I can.

97
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
If you have any questions,

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
feel free to ask for guidance

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
from other architects.

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Boss.

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,840
But I...

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm not asking you to finish the whole project.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
I only want you to give me an idea for the design.

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,040
I'll try my best.

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,840
Very well.

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Carry on.

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,560
It may only be a draft,

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
but you still need to be cautious.

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,000
Feel free to ask anything.

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,160
Sure.

112
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,760
Xiao Ning.

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Cheng Dong is right.

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,280
Keep it up.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,840
Maybe you'll come up

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
with something remarkable.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,880
Thank you.

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
I'll do my best.

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,760
All the best.

120
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,160
All the best.

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
Good luck.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,960
All right.

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
It seems like bad luck

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,120
doesn't always haunt you.

125
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,600
Work hard.

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,520
You only contacted me

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
because of

128
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
what Jiang Xiao Ning told you?

129
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,760
What else could it be?

130
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
I thought you finally saw

131
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
the greatness in me.

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
Shall we keep this going?

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
What did she say about me?

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,640
She told me

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
you are a rich second generation who is pretty nice.

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,800
That's all?

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,240
It's true that I'm pretty nice.

138
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,040
As for the rich second generation...

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
Not really.

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,600
I worked hard

141
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560
to start my own business.

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,040
My dad's money

143
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
has nothing to do with me.

144
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
The two of us...

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
never get along since I was a child.

146
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
He never needs me anyway.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
He has others to serve him.

148
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
Do you have a sibling?

149
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,400
I wish I had.

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,120
My family

151
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,960
is a little complicated.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
I'll explain more another day.

153
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
In short,

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
I hate his money.

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,240
I don't want to be shackled by money

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
like my mother.

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,000
You can either finish the story

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,560
or say nothing at all.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
Telling only parts of it

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
is awkward.

161
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,600
It's just a typical family drama.

162
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Their marriage is dead already,

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,400
but they won't get a divorce.

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,400
I guess it was their pride.

165
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
I asked my mother

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,080
why she didn't get a divorce.

167
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
Do you know what she told me?

168
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,000
If she divorces,

169
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,920
she won't get

170
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,520
as much money as she can now.

171
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
I feel like

172
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,030
money can be

173
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
so meaningless sometimes.

174
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
I refuse to take a penny from them

175
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840
and I insist on starting my own business.

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,560
My car is not bad, right?

177
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,640
It's a second-hand car. I've only bought it

178
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,000
for the sake of doing business.

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,200
That's all of my story.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
Shouldn't you tell me your stories?

181
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
You have a strong personality.

182
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Your parents

183
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,440
must love you a lot.

184
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,560
My parents

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,280
got a divorce

186
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
when I was very young.

187
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
They soon formed

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
their own new families.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,080
So I

190
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
was tossed over from one home

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,760
to another by my parents.

192
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,760
They were both my homes

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
but none of them felt like it.

194
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,480
As soon as I could afford it,

195
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
I moved out.

196
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Come on.

197
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,520
To my hard work

198
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,520
and your independence.

199
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Cheers.

200
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
For full disclosure,

201
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
I only came here

202
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,320
to thank you on Xiao Ning's behalf.

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
This meal is on me.

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
I don't care about the reason.

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
As long as you're willing to see me,

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm okay with

207
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,640
any bad excuse.

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
Xiao Ning.

209
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm getting off work. Bye.

210
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,120
You fell asleep?

211
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,880
Is this

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,440
the best you can offer?

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm stuck.

214
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,520
It does seem like it.

215
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Boss.

216
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,400
May I ask you something?

217
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,120
♪The birds standing in pair on the tree♪

218
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Where is the designated driver?

219
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Driver?

220
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Drive...

221
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,640
Get on the car.

222
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Come with me

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
if you want to live.

224
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,160
Why should I go with you?

225
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,720
Stop talking if you want to keep your limbs.

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,080
You'll be safe here.

227
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,440
You paid for the meal just now.

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
This man?

229
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,840
Leave him to me.

230
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,080
Seriously?

231
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
I...

232
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,040
Are you okay?

233
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,920
I see.

234
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
Now it makes sense.

235
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,280
I see now why she said that.

236
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
What did she say?

237
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,520
She told me

238
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,600
maybe you are the only one

239
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,840
who knows how to heal her wound.

240
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,480
I wish

241
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
I could be that amazing.

242
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Tell me.

243
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,080
What is stopping you?

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,160
My concept is

245
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,480
that the wall is a dimension

246
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
different from our reality.

247
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,520
It's a world of memories

248
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
for Ms. Cheng.

249
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,040
The memories are precious.

250
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
So I want to protect it.

251
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,280
Then I got stuck.

252
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,360
I have no idea how to display

253
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
the other dimension.

254
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
How should I

255
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,200
protect it?

256
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,240
Wait here.

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Is this a gift for me?

258
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Not a chance.

259
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,360
Open it.

260
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,520
This is beautiful.

261
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,680
I got it as a gift

262
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,160
from a hotel in Switzerland.

263
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,960
It was winter.

264
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,640
The whole mountain was covered in white snow.

265
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,720
Just like this snow globe.

266
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
I was staying at a place

267
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,720
known as Rose Town.

268
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,760
The time I spent there

269
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
was very happy.

270
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
So this snow globe

271
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
reminds you of that wonderful memory.

272
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Indeed.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
I get it now!

274
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
The glass of this snow globe

275
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,440
is shielding your precious memory.

276
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,240
We could use

277
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,000
a glass shield

278
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
to keep the wall

279
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,200
safe from any harm.

280
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
You're smart.

281
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
Glass is a kind material

282
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,680
that is clear as water.

283
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
It's there but not very noticeable.

284
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,480
Just like memories.

285
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
I find that

286
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,560
you do have a gift for designing.

287
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,640
Boss.

288
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm so fortunate to have met you.

289
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I mean,

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,200
thank you

291
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,360
for offering me this job.

292
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,680
I never thought

293
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,080
there would be an opportunity for me

294
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,760
to be so close to my dream.

295
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,960
I always thought I have bad luck.

296
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,320
It felt like

297
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,240
nothing good would ever happen to me

298
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,800
and it was my fate.

299
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,640
Happiness is not something you're born with,

300
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,360
but earned with effort.

301
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,640
A crow

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,080
will never become an eagle.

303
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,040
I always fail

304
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
and always have bad luck.

305
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,360
My classmates avoided me.

306
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
They thought my bad luck

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
was infectious.

308
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Crows are

309
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
one of the smartest birds in the world.

310
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
They would place walnuts

311
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,280
on the road

312
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,120
and wait for a car to crush the nut

313
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,000
so they can eat it.

314
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Crows are very loyal.

315
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,280
They only stay with one partner for life.

316
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
They spend their entire life

317
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
defending their territory

318
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
and their partner.

319
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,600
Really?

320
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,560
I didn't know crows were so great.

321
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,960
So

322
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,680
don't be bothered by others' opinions.

323
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,800
Remember

324
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,880
not to look down on yourself.

325
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,560
Thank you, Boss.

326
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,920
Who could it be at this hour?

327
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,040
I ordered some food.

328
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,320
You must be starving.

329
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,400
You're the best, Boss.

330
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,800
I don't want my employee

331
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
to work overtime on an empty stomach.

332
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,200
Go get the food.

333
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,080
We'll work

334
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,000
as we eat.

335
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
If you acted sooner,

337
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
I wouldn't be injured.

338
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,400
You were the one acting tough.

339
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm a man.

340
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,840
I should protect you.

341
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
You deserve some credit.

342
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,000
At least, you survived

343
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,720
until I took off my heels.

344
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,160
Yan Yan.

345
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
From now on,

346
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,800
don't get into fights again.

347
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Why not?

348
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
I'll be jealous

349
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,760
when you touch other men.

350
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,280
Not even while I'm beating them?

351
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,440
Promise me

352
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,760
never to get into a fight again.

353
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,960
If you need a punching bag,

354
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
you can punch me.

355
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,760

Ms. Cheng.

371
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,000
Miss Jiang.

372
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,360
Thank you.

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,400
I must thank you

374
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,400
for what you've told my husband.

375
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
You're young,

376
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
but I think

377
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
your mind is clearer than mine.

378
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,040
Not at all.

379
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm lost

380
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,240
most of the time.

381
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,720
Come.

382
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,360
Do you see the sun?

383
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,840
I remember that one day

384
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
my son said this to me,

385
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,840
"Mother,

386
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
I drew a sun for you.

387
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,120
From now on,

388
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,080
you'll never feel cold again

389
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,880
and you'll never fall sick again.

390
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,400
This sun

391
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,600
will always keep you warm

392
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
with its light."

393
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,720
I was having a cold that day.

394
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,080
He gave me this sun

395
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
as a gift.

396
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,440
These memories

397
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
are very precious to you.

398
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,040
They are worth cherishing.

399
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,640
So for our design plan,

400
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
not only are we

401
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,200
keeping the wall,

402
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,440
but we're also giving it

403
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,680
a protective cover

404
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
to keep it safe forever.

405
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
Miss Jiang.

406
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,000
We appreciate

407
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,280
your thoughtful planning.

408
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,880
However,

409
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,160
is a simple glass shield

410
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
the only element in your design?

411
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,280
We can add on some decorations.

412
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,240
We can turn it into a snow globe

413
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,840
with snow,

414
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,880
a castle,

415
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,000
and music.

416
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,200
Miss Jiang.

417
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,080
It sounds

418
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,760
more like an idea.

419
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,480
Do you

420
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,880
have a specific design?

421
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
Specific design?

422
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Ms. Cheng,

423
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,160
allow me

424
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
to introduce the specifics.

425
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
For the design of your art gallery,

426
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,200
we are planning to implement

427
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,080
advanced AR technology.

428
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
It won't be

429
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
just a glass-covered world.

430
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,000
We can

431
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
replicate the image of your son

432
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,600
with the materials you provide.

433
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
We can recreate the memories

434
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
left on this wall.

435
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,880
In other words,

436
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,360
you will be able to see

437
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,800
your memories from the past

438
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
any time you want.

439
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,360
We'll put up a glass screen wall

440
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,120
at the front.

441
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,920
The lighting effect

442
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,000
will create a hologram,

443
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,740
creating a surreal presentation.

444
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,980

445
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,260

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,140

449
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,720
No matter what dispute we had before,

450
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
I must thank you.

451
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
You make my dream come true.

452
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
Thank you.

453
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
Thank you for your trust.

454
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
Thank you

455
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,640
for sharing your experience

456
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,560
with us.

457
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,640
It's an honor.

458
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,080
The honor is mine.

459
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,400
Very well.

460
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,960
We should get going.

461
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Thank you.

462
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
Have a nice day.

463
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
We finally persuaded them.

464
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,800
Boss.

465
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
Thank you.

466
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,280
Don't mention it.

467
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Boss.

468
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
Here's your snow globe.

469
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
It's yours now.

470
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
You did a good job.

471
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,360
Take this as your reward.

472
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,840
But this is too valuable.

473
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
I can't take this.

474
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
It's not that expensive.

475
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,440
Just a gift from the hotel.

476
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,800
How fortunate of you.

477
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
You keep getting gifts.

478
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Pack it up. It's yours now.

479
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
Thank you, Boss.

480
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,720
Am I more magnificent than the view here?

481
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
The view?

482
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
The view is no match for your elegance.

483
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,560
Stop fawning over me.

484
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Boss.

485
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
Are you going to fire me?

486
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,400
You haven't paid

487
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,360
the medical bills

488
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,680
for your aunt.

489
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,560
I can't possibly

490
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
let you go so easily.

491
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,800
Boss,

492
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,880
you know?

493
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
There is an issue with you.

494
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,360
What is it?

495
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,840
You're cold on the outside, soft on the inside.

496
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm not soft on the inside.

497
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,840
You just can't see it.

498
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,360
Let's go.

499
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,680
The sun is about to go away.

500
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,160
The sun is never going away.

501
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
You just can't see it sometimes.

502
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,600
Earth's rotation

503
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
blocks your line of sight

504
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,360
but the sun is always there.

505
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Whether you like it or not,

506
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,360
the sun will rise the next morning.

507
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
Don't always look at the negative side.

508
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,000
Just like my parents,

509
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,160
they are never gone.

510
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,800
They are always in here.

511
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,040
If you can't change your life,

512
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,360
then make the present days

513
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,000
happy ones.

514
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,520
Why are you telling me this?

515
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,800
Because I once saw

516
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,280
the light in your eyes.

517
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
But it didn't last long.

518
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
I think

519
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,000
you're a man of stories.

520
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,240
I saw the light

521
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,480
in your eyes.

522
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,080
It's the kind of happiness

523
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,840
that I wish

524

will never disappear.

525
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,320
I don't want you to lose that light.

526
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,800
Did I say too much just now?

527
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,960
Not at all.

528
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,200
You're right.

529
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,320
Life is short.

530
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,920
Why not

531
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,840
make it a happy one?

532
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
The view here is nice.

533
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,360

534
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,560

You must be Mr. Gu.

Don't apologize to me.

The files are on your desk.

581
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,840
Okay.

582
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,680
Who gave you the flowers? It's pretty.

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,840
You bought them?

585
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
What's the flower for?

586
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,280
Is this for

587
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
an important client?

I can go get some.

590
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,520
No.

591
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,880
I bought them for myself.

592
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Is Jiang Xiao Ning here?

593
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,560
She is.

594
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,240
Send her to my office.

595
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,600
Cheng Dong.

596
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,440
You two

597
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,680
will be in charge of this project.

598
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,240
Your focus is...

599
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
Whom are those flowers for?

600
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,040
No idea.

601
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,400
I was worried that drinking coffee
on an empty stomach

602
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,800
might cause a stomachache,

603
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,440
so I brought you some snacks.

604
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,200
Xiao Ning, how thoughtful of you.

605
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,680
I didn't have time for breakfast.

606
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,800
I'm starving.

607
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,360
Dong.

608
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,240
Give me the meat jerky.

609
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,040
I need to replenish my energy.

610
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,880
Thanks, Xiao Ning.

611
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
You're becoming more attentive.

612
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,160
I learned from the best.

613
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,520
Xiao Ning.

614
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,800
Our boss

615
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,880
has more trust in you now.

616

00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,320
don't forget me.

618
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,320
I've never thought about

619
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,360
something so far away.

620
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,640
No way.

621
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,560
By the way,

622
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,560
leave the trivial matters

623
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,040
to us.

624
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,160

625
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,440
Don't forget us.

626
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,000
Sister Man Lin.

627
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,080
Have some coffee.

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Mr. Gu asked for you.

629
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,440
Okay.

630
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,240
Good morning, Boss.

631
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,440
You asked for me?

632
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,440
Trim the flowers for me

633
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,440
and put them in a vase.

634
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
Yes, right away.

635
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,560
Boss.

636
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,520
Why are you interest in flowers suddenly?

637
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,120
Since I can't change my life,

638
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
I must find a way

639
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,240
to make my life

640
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,680
somewhat happier.

641
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,720
You're making fun of me.

642
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,440
I need you to buy everyone

643
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
a bouquet of flowers.

644
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,840
Is it a tough task?

645
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,200
No problem.

646
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I'll get it done now.

647
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,520
Mr. Gu bought everyone flowers.

648
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,360
Pick the ones you like.

649
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,440
I'm taking this.

650
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
Come on, pick a flower.

651
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
Mr. Gu really bought us flowers?

652
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Is this really happening?

653
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Pick a flower.

654
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,240
Pick yours now.

655
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,120
I want this.

656
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,200
What's wrong with Boss?

657
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,520
How should I know?

658
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,600
Why is he giving everyone flowers all of a sudden?

659
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Is he in love?

660
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,040
Jiang Xiao Ning?

661
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,960
Yes, Jiang Xiao Ning.

662
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,080
Nothing is impossible.

663
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,280
Did you finish your work

664
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,520
and have nothing to do?

665
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,920
Take it.

666
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
Sister Man Lin, pick a flower.

667
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,160
Hello?

668
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Gu, hello.

669
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,520
How may I help you?

670
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Order some plants for me.

671
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,440
Okay, no problem.

672
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,880
What plants do you want?

673
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
You may ask

674
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,640
the florist we used to work with.

675
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,040
Ask for his opinion.

676
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,800
I want my room

677
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,240
to be more lively.

678
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,920
Okay, consider it done.

679
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,840
Should I send them to the office?

680
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,920
Yes.

681
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,360
I'll need some for my home too.

682
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,560
Okay.

683
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,600
You can count on me.

684
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,800
Mr. Gu, bye.

685
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,480
Hello?

686
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,600
Gu!

687
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,120
Your data seems promising lately.

688
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,040
I want to know

689
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,800
if you're feeling any changes.

690
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,280
Nothing special in particular.

691
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,440
Perhaps it's because

692
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm not as busy lately.

693
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,560
There is less pressure.

694
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,320
I've told you

695
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,800
not to work too hard.

696
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
It helps a lot.

697
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,360
Other than work,

698
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,190
have you experienced

699
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,710
anything memorable?

700
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,440
Nothing special.

701
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,000
Maybe...

702
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,520
I feel a little happier lately.

703
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,710
Technically,

704
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,080
happiness will increase

705
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,600
your blood flow,

706
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,040
which would increase the need for oxygen

707
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,840
and the load on your heart.

708
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,840
But this is odd.

709
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,040
However,

710
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,440
happiness brings positive results.

711
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,320
Continue being happy.

712
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

713
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,080
Charging.

714
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,840
Mr. Gu.

715
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Come in.

716
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,840
There are

717
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,320
some issues at the resort.

718
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,880
What's wrong?

719
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,560
It's nothing major.

720
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
We made adjustments

721
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
to the plans,

722
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,000
but it involves partial relocation.

723
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
The progress will be delayed.

724
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,240
Which means...

725
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,960
Judging by the pace,

726
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,160
we won't make it in time

727
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
for the Jin An Award nomination.

728
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,640
We'll have to wait for another two years.

729
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,840
(Waiting for another year)

730
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
(might not be a setback.)

731
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,760
(But it must not be later than that.)

732
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,040
It's rare to see architects

733
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,840
who are

734
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,560
so obsessed with one award like you.

735
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Everyone's life

736
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,080
is a different story.

737
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,920
We don't have to be so focused

738
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,200
on winning the award.

739
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
Why not leave it in fate's hand?

740
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,320
I've been waiting to win this award.

741
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,320
Consider it

742
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
my finish line.

743
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
You are still too young

744
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
to be thinking about the finish line.

745
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,360
Are you not going to live

746
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,600
after winning this award?

747
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,440
This one

748
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
is all I ever need.

749
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,320
Very well.

750
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,000
However,

751
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,120
I've always admired your persistence.

752
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
By the way,

753
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,360
what's with the sudden interest

754
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,000
in plants and flowers?

755
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
I don't know either.

756
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,760
Maybe I'm hoping

757
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,640
to bring some light

758
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,280
to the darkness in my life.

759
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
As long as it makes you happy.

760
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
(However,)

761
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,200
(happiness brings positive results.)

762
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,240
(Continue being happy.)

763
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,640
The resort project

764
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,240
is over for the time being.

765
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
Thank you for the hard work.

766
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,000
Tomorrow,

767
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,880
all of you

768
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,080
will have  two-day team-building event.

769
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,400
Thank you, Boss!

770
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,160
As for the destination,

771
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,160
that's up to you.

772
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,920
Okay!

773
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,880
Thank you, Boss!

774
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,840
My goodness, he was smiling!

775
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,760
What is going on?

776
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,840
Is this really happening?

777
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,720
Is he in love?

778
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,920
Jia Jia.

779
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Your lipstick

780
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,360
is smudged.

781
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Check it out.

782
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,640
Jiang Xiao Ning.

783
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,560
Sister Man Lin.

784
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,960
I don't think you'll be able to join us.

785
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,200
You haven't finished your work.

786
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
What work?

787
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
The presentation for

788
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,880
our gallery project.

789
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,560
Not to mention

790
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,240
the project statement assigned to you

791
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
is really urgent.

792
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,440
Okay.

793
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,360
No problem.

794
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,240
Xiao Ning.

795
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,960
Can't you just

796
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,720
finish the work before you come back from the trip?

797
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,760
Is that alright?

798
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,080
Wang Kai.

799
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,960
I said no and you dare said yes?

800
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,640
Are you standing against me

801
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,280
or are you defending Jiang Xiao Ning?

802
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,640
Jiang Xiao Ning.

803
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,080
Can you finish it or not?

804
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,000
I can do it.

805
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,240
Thanks, Brother Kai.

806
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,120
Don't mention it.

807
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,400
It's no big deal.

808
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
I can't stand

809
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,280
her autocratic manner.

810
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,880
This is my job.

811
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,480
Don't worry.

812
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,960
Okay.

813
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,440
Keep it on.

814
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,920
Brother Xu.

815
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,000
Why do you insist that we talk in person?

816
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,040
You just got back from your business trip,

817
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,160
you should get some rest.

818
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,840
I brought

819
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,600
some souvenirs.

820
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,080
Give them to Grandma and Aunty.

821
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,080
Thank you, Brother Xu.

822
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,240
By the way,

823
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
one more thing.

824
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,520
What is this?

825
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,800
A small present.

826
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
I'll take the souvenirs,

827
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
but I can't accept this.

828
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,960
Xiao Ning.

829
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,920
I would be upset

830
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
if you turned me down.

831
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,960
I'll be mad if you give this to me.

832
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,000
Don't worry. It's cheap.

833
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,840
It's not expensive.

834
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,480
Let me drive you home.

835
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:42,920
You're not

836
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,640
as nice as you were.

837
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,560
I'll help you put it on.

838
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,080
It's done.

839
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,160
It looks good on you.

840
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,760
Thank you, Brother Xu.

841
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
I left something in the office.

842
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,280
You can go back first.

843
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,080
How is it?

844
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,280
Look, you're pretty with it.

845
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
(Where have you been lately?)

846
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,240
(You disappeared without a word.)

847
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,320
(Yan Yan.)

848
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,760
(I miss you.)

849
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,760
Love-struck again?

850
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,440
What?

851
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Why are you drinking on your own?

852
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,600
You haven't contacted me in a while.

853
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,080
I'm busy.

854
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,280
Busy with what?

855
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm busy spending time with my girlfriend.

856
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,560
You have a girlfriend?

857
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,560
Who's the lucky girl?

858
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,200
My perfect lady.

859
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,640
Fate brought her to me.

860
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,160
My true love and my buster.

861
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,160
I'll spend

862
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,680
the rest of my life with her.

863
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,560
You're crazy.

864
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,320
Bye.

865
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,520
One more, please.

866
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
(Are you asleep?)

867
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,280
(I'm still awake.)

868
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,960
(I'm thinking)

869
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,840
(about what food I should prepare for you.)

870
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,840
(The food there might not fit your appetite.)

871
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
