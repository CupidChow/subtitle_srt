=Episode 33=

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,040
You've started building

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
your house of love together already?

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
Mr. Xu, what are you doing here?

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
You seem to have a lot of free time.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,600
There are some bricks over there.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,680
Help us move them.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,880
So cold?

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,840
If it weren't for my big mouth,

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,120
how can you two

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
be this lovey-dovey right now?

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
Thank you.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,759
What are you doing here, Mr. Xu?

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Chuan.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
Something came up at the studio.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,720
The landmark project proposal

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
needs to be amended.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,560
Okay.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
I'll head to the office after I'm done here.

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,240
Actually, no need.

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
I found someone and got it done already.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,680
Who?

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,840
Su Man Lin.

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
Sister Man Lin's back?

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,320
You two finally

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
got back together.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
I didn't want others

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
to bother you.

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,160
So I asked her

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
to come back to help out.

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,680
Helped you buy

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
some precious time together.

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,720
The amendments

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,600
have been sent to your email.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Take a look at night when you have time.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
If you have time,

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
drop by the office tomorrow.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,680
After all,

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
you're the lead designer on that project.

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
You can't not care.

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
Mr. Xu.

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,520
If you've already solved the problem,

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
why bother coming here?

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
You could have just called.

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm here to see Xiao Ning, alright?

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Of course. Thanks, Mr. Xu.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm here to drop something off for you.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
Someone

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,640
forced me to lie to you to make you sign.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,640
His will.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,440
Take a look.

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,880
Don't get angry and don't quarrel.

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,760
A will?

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't do anything like this again, okay?

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
I don't need you to

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
make all these plans for me.

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
I just want you

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,880
to include me in your future plans.

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
Of course you're in

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
my future plans.

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,760
Rules are rules.

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
Not even occasionally?

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
No.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,840
I need to think for

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
your health.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Just once.

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,640
No.

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,080
Let's cuddle.

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,840
Good morning.

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Didn't I tell you

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
to not come pick me up anymore?

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,120
Why?

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
How can I let my girlfriend

93
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
drive me around every day?

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
Aside from being your girlfriend,

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm also your employee,

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,320
your assistant.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Driving is my job.

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
To make me have no qualms

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
about earning money,

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,040
please order me around

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
as much as you can.

102
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,840
This way,

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
if I get paid less,

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,920
I can bad-mouth you.

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,800
Let's walk to work today.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Can you?

107
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,200
Not every day.

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,040
Just today.

109
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
What do you mean?

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
Starting tomorrow,

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,880
if there are no special circumstances,

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,840
I don't plan on going back to work.

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
I want to spend more time

114
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
on other things.

115
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,080
Like spending time with my parents,

116
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,480
spending time with you.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Sure.

118
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Then what about the studio?

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
You're the soul of the studio.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,640
You can't keep making

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,800
Mr. Xu act on your behalf.

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Then it won't be "Chuan Design Studio".

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,320
Then I can change it into "Ran Design Studio".

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,160
These things

125
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
aren't important to me anymore.

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,360
I've been working so hard for ten years.

127
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
It's not unreasonable

128
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,720
to take a break.

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Okay.

130
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,000
Then I'll go with you.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Let's go.

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,560
But the person I just said

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
who doesn't have to work

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,360
is me.

135
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,280
You still have to go to work.

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Do I really?

137
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Of course.

138
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
You don't like working?

139
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
I do. A lot.

140
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,880
That's it.

141
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
Who's going to pay my bills if you don't work?

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Everyone,

143
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,280
listen up.

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,640
Mr. Xu just informed me

145
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
Mr. Gu is coming back to the studio today.

146
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Everybody, get to work.

147
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,800
Hurry.

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Move.

149
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,840
That's so great.

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm having a hard time making a decision.

151
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
What are you doing? Get to work.

152
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760
Boss is back.

153
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
What are you scared of?

154
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Xiao Ning must be

155
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,480
coming back with him.

156
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
How can you be so sure?

157
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,800
Maybe the negotiation went wrong

158
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,720
and they went their separate ways.

159
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Shut your mouth.

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,000
Good morning.

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,040
Oh my gosh.

162
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,160
I thought it was Boss who came back.

163
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,080
So it's you, Xiao Ning.

164
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,160
Should be Mrs. Boss.

165
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,120
Xiao Ning,

166
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
you're finally back.

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,480
It was so boring

168
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
without you here.

169
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,320
As long as you're here,

170
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
we don't have to look at

171
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
Mr. Gu's ghostly face every day.

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
If it weren't...

173
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,600
If it weren't for

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
my infinite adoration

175
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,480
and admiration for Mr. Gu,

176
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,200
he's literally the beacon that lights the way
in my life.

177
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,400
I've always been wondering

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
how could a person

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,400
be this super-duper exceptional.

180
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm just...

181
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,440
Hi, Mr. Gu.

182
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Morning.

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,800
Morning.

184
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,600
Looks pretty good.

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,800
It can be sent off right away

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,200
after I make some amendments.

187
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,000
In other words,

188
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,520
my job here is done.

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,200
To be honest,

190
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,320
I'm really happy to be able to have

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,120
this opportunity to make things up.

192
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
You're ready to go to your new job?

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
Thank you for giving me

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
this chance to make up for my mistakes.

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,480
And thank you for

196
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,840
sending my resume

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
to that company overseas.

198
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,200
They're willing to hire you

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,000
because you have the right qualifications.

200
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
A new company, a new environment,

201
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,240
a new life.

202
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,160
I hope I can also have a new beginning.

203
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Good luck.

204
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm going to

205
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,040
have dinner with Jiang Xiao Ning tonight.

206
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,720
Gu Chuan. Take care of yourself.

207
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,360
You don't look so well.

208
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,040
Thank you.

209
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
It was me who brought you to this company.

210
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Who would have thought

211
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,640
you'd be the one to send me off today.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,919
Sister Man Lin.

213
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,520
Thank you so much.

214
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
You've always been my role model

215
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
and you've taught me so much.

216
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
I've taught you so much,

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,760
but I've failed myself.

218
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
I used to think

219
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
the reason Gu Chuan didn't like me

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
is that I wasn't outstanding enough,

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,760
not good enough for him.

222
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
So I kept trying harder and harder.

223
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
But to what end?

224
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
You know how things went.

225
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,600
I still lost to you.

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't say that.

227
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,000
You're brilliant.

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
One day, I hope you can

229
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,840
meet someone

230
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,880
who can make you happy

231
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,680
even during your saddest moments.

232
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,720
Now I know

233
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,400
why he fell for you.

234
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
You're like those

235
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,000
female leads in dramas.

236
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,600
Although you were

237
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,040
a little annoying in the beginning,

238
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
as time goes on,

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
you can't really get people to dislike you.

240
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
This is probably your charm.

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
This is the first time I've heard you compliment me.

242
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,240
You're indeed

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
more mature than when

244
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
you first came to the studio.

245
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,560
So that's why I keep

246
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,600
wanting to thank you.

247
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,480
It's me who should thank you.

248
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Why?

249
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
If you didn't come into the picture,

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
I would've stayed by Gu Chuan's side

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,600
like I've always done.

252
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,720
Because I believed that

253
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
as long as I waited for him,

254
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,960
he'd be mine eventually.

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,400
But you made me realize that

256
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
no matter how hard I tried,

257
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,880
how long I waited,

258
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,000
the results would be the same.

259
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,680
He wouldn't fall for me.

260
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,600
You'll meet someone who you like

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
and likes you back for sure.

262
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,480
Who knows. I'll just let it be.

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,800
But I came here today

264
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
to tell you something.

265
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Jiang Xiang Ning,

266
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
I wish you happiness.

267
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Sister Man Lin, thank you.

268
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
How many bookings have you gotten tonight?

269
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,480
I haven't gotten any yet.

270
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
I have a feeling I'm going to
get bookings tonight.

271
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
At least one.

272
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,640
Isn't it hard for a girl like you

273
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
to be a designated driver?

274
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,080
It's okay. As long as you get used to it.

275
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,760
Still not here.

276
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
Right.

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm hungry.

278
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Hungry.

279
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,000
You guys take your time.

280
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,240
I've already paid the bill.

281
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
Once Xiao Ning gets here,

282
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,880
we'll leave first.

283
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,720
Mr. Gu, why are you in such a rush?

284
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,480
Once Xiao Ning gets here,

285
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,520
you should have something to eat before leaving.

286
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,240
Exactly.

287
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,400
Sorry, everyone.

288
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm late.

289
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,880
Xiao Ning, come on.

290
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
Xiao Ning, we've been waiting for you.

291
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
We couldn't start without you.

292
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm sorry.

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,920
Now that everyone's here,

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,680
let's...

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,040
let's drink to

296
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,240
Boss and Xiao Ning's

297
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
sweet comeback.

298
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,520
Thank you.

299
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,840
Cheers. Thank you.

300
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,120
Come on, give it to me.

301
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
I have to drink to that.

302
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,200
You can't drink.

303
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
This drink is to everyone.

304
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,520
Thank you for all your hard work these years.

305
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,880
Thank you.

306
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
Thank you, Boss.

307
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Bottoms up.

308
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,120
Alright.

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
I'll leave with Xiao Ning first.

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
Her exam is coming up.

311
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I have to tutor her.

312
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,400
You're tutoring her personally?

313
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes.

314
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,400
We'll leave first then.

315
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,720
Okay.

316
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,760
Bye, Boss.

317
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
You guys take your time. Enjoy.

318
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,360
Bye-bye, Xiao Ning.

319
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,160
Bye-bye.

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Bye-bye.

321
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
Why do I feel like

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Boss is acting weird today?

323
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,440
I always thought Boss

324
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,880
would end up with Su Man Lin.

325
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,600
I didn't expect it to be Jiang Xiao Ning.

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,680
Are you that slow?

327
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,040
I knew a long time ago.

328
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,480
Mainly because neither of them said anything,

329
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,800
so I couldn't really gossip about it.

330
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,520
Being at the company for so long,

331
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,200
I've witnessed enough public displays
of affection.

332
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
When will I finally meet

333
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,360
my Prince Charming?

334
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,160
What are you looking at?

335
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,160
Cheng Dong.

336
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
What? I can't?

337
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,040
No.

338
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,320
You can't look at him.

339
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,080
Come with me.

340
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Hurry.

341
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm eating.

342
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,320
Where to?

343
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,680
Jia Jia, could you save some face

344
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,040
for me in front of our co-workers?

345
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
What's wrong with me looking at handsome guys?

346
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
You can't.

347
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
Fine. Then tell me

348
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,720
why looking at Cheng Dong is wrong.

349
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,720
Look, you're

350
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,520
a single lady.

351
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,240
Ogling like that

352
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,960
isn't good for your image.

353
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,480
Wang Kai, you're a chicken.

354
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
How am I chicken?

355
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,520
In every way.

356
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,800
You coward.

357
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,680
You like me.

358
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Why can't you just say that directly?

359
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
Always beating around the bush.

360
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,080
Aren't you tired?

361
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,920
There are so many people at the office.

362
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
Look at Jiang Xiao Ning.

363
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,480
She made a public confession.

364
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,600
What are you afraid of?

365
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Do you like me or not?

366
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,600
I...

367
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,600
Say it.

368
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,800
I...

369
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,840
Are you telling me or not?

370
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,720
Ouch.

371
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,160
I like you.

372
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,560
Then kiss me.

373
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,120
No.

374
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,400
Wang Kai.

375
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,040
No, no, no.

376
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,080
The timing isn't right.

377
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,880
This setting isn't very fitting.

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
But can you feel

379
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,760
my burning heart?

380
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Feel my heartbeat.

381
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,280
Feel it.

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
Okay, I got it.

383
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,680
I know you felt it.

384
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Let's go eat.

385
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,320
I didn't feel it.

386
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,920
Let's go eat.

387
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,560
Let's go eat, okay?

388
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
Let's go eat. Eat.

389
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,480
This setting is really not right.

390
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
Really couldn't do it.

391
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,560
No.

392
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm serious.

393
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,520
Before the tutoring session,

394
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,320
let's deal with

395
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,240
this first.

396
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Xu Cheng Ran lied to me.

397
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,960
I didn't take a look at these carefully
before signing them.

398
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,480
I'll ask our legal department

399
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,400
to take a look at it

400
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,080
to see how we can

401
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,120
rescind these agreements.

402
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
Back then, I was scared,

403
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,920
in case...

404
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,000
There is no "in case".

405
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
Starting now,

406
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
you just need to think about

407
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,760
how you're going to live happily every day.

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
From now on, each of your days

409
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,960
must have me in them.

410
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,600
Also,

411
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,240
don't work too hard.

412
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't do any housework either.

413
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,000
I got it.

414
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Get to studying.

415
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,120
Do you agree with what I said?

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,920
I do.

417
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,839
Okay. Teacher.

418
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
You can start your lesson.

419
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
First, I have a question for you.

420
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,920
The minimum clearance of the upper and

421
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
lower aisles of a stairs landing

422
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,520
is 2 meters.

423
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,960
The minimum

424
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,480
headroom clearance for stairs is 2.2 meters.

425
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Was that statement

426
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
correct or incorrect?

427
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,400
Correct.

428
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,920
Correct?

429
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
Incorrect?

430
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,600
Incorrect?

431
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,080
Incorrect.

432
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,400
Are you just randomly guessing?

433
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,320
I know the answer.

434
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
You asked the question so suddenly,

435
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,680
so I doubted myself.

436
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,880
Ask another question.

437
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,760
Think carefully

438
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,320
about the question I just asked you.

439
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Have you read this section?

440
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,360
This section.

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,480
I finished the entire book.

442
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,040
How about this?

443
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
Not yet.

444
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Looks like you're in a bad mood.

445
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,200
Did you ask me to come drink with you?

446
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,400
Not to drink.

447
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,560
Something better.

448
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,280
You're really something.

449
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,400
The good things you talk about

450
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,120
never end up happening.

451
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,080
You don't need to invest anything this time.

452
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
Just need some physical strength.

453
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,960
Then tell me.

454
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
The thing is...

455
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,840
some money came into my branch.

456
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,240
I want to move this money

457
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,080
to Zhi Mu Design's account.

458
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,360
Help me find a way

459
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,680
to cash it out.

460
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
I'll give you 20 percent afterwards.

461
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,720
How much?

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,760
Thirty million.

463
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,880
That much?

464
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,440
Whose is it?

465
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,920
It's Xu Guo Xiang's for now,

466
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600
but it'll be mine later.

467
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
You dare touch his money?

468
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,040
Aren't you scared he's going to kill you?

469
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Zheng, relax.

470
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
I have something on him.

471
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,640
He wouldn't dare to touch me.

472
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,320
Plus, I've done

473
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
so much for him over the years.

474
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,640
If there were problems, I would've
gone to jail already.

475
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
I deserve this money.

476
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't you worry.

477
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll take responsibility if something
were to happen.

478
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,760
Thirty percent should be enough, right?

479
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
Alright, I'll do it.

480
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
But I'm telling you right now,

481
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,680
if something were to happen, you would
have to deal with it.

482
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,720
Don't worry.

483
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
Looking forward to working with you again.

484
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,880
Director Xu.

485
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,480
Director Xu.

486
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,000
Xiao Xu. Why is it taking so long?

487
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,560
It has been more than a week already.

488
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,480
How come the money still hasn't been cashed out?

489
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,080
Didn't you ask me to be more careful?

490
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm being thorough.

491
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
Don't want to get caught.

492
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,960
No matter how thorough you're being,
it should've been done already.

493
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
It didn't take this long last time.

494
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,800
Am I doing it or are you?

495
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,080
You can do it then.

496
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,320
Director Xu.

497
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
Director Xu. It's still going to take a few more days.

498
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
Xiao Xu.

499
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,440
Although we're not related by blood,

500
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,320
we've been living together for more than ten years.

501
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,800
You should know that

502
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
I think of you as my own son.

503
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Of course, I do.

504
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,120
You've always been so good to me.

505
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,760
So, think about it.

506
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
Why do I ask you to transfer

507
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,200
that much money?

508
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,600
It's because I trust you.

509
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,960
Xiao Xu.

510
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
You can't let me down.

511
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,120
I won't, Director Xu.

512
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,640
I won't let you down.

513
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,880
You've treated me so well.

514
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
That's good.

515
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,200
That's good.

516
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,960
Go on.

517
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,120
This isn't normal.

518
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,840
I think something has been

519
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,080
going on with this kid as well.

520
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
Keep an eye on him.

521
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,440
Find out what's going on.

522
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,440
Okay, right away.

523
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,200
Xiao Mi, is Xu Cheng Ran in?

524
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,360
Yes.

525
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,640
He has been

526
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,560
working overtime for several nights.

527
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,720
I know.

528
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,760
I'm going to go in to see him.

529
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
How about I give him a heads-up first?

530
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,920
That's alright.

531
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,960
Once he's done with work,

532
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
we'll go home together.

533
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,200
You've worked hard.

534
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,160
Thank you.

535
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,960
Wifey.

536
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,400
What are you doing here?

537
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,640
Wifey brought Hubby food.

538
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
Is that a problem?

539
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,480
Wifey.

540
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,560
I thought you didn't want anyone

541
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,080
to know about our relationship.

542
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,800
You're not afraid that someone will see us?

543
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
We're official and legal.

544
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,640
What's there to be scared of?

545
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,720
But before, you...

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,520
No more "but"s.

547
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
From today on,

548
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,320
I want to

549
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,320
be with you openly.

550
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
You've finally come around.

551
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,400
So cute.

552
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Xu Cheng Ran.

553
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,600
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,200
I didn't want you to make

555
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,040
our relationship public

556
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,360
because I was overthinking everything,

557
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,840
not because you're not worthwhile.

558
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Seeing Gu Chuan and Jiang Xiao Ning

559
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,400
getting back together

560
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
made me think that

561
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,840
I should cherish

562
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
every single day I get to spend with you.

563
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,600
Wifey is right.

564
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
You should cherish me.

565
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,440
Let's go home right now.

566
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,920
So you could make it up to me.

567
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520
What's wrong with you?

568
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,760
I just gave you an inch

569
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,120
and now you want to take a mile?

570
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,680
Oh, right. Wifey.

571
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,600
I want you to come to a press conference

572
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,720
being held in a few days.

573
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,160
No, I'm just

574
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,080
a department manager.

575
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,320
What manager?

576
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
You're my wife.

577
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,520
You have to come.

578
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,600
I don't want you to miss

579
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
your husband's shining moment.

580
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,760
Get back to work.

581
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
Have it while it's hot.

582
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm leaving.

583
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,360
What work?

584
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,320
Didn't I say

585
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,200
we're going home and you're making things up to me?

586
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,600
Let's go.

587
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,960
(Chairman's Office)

588
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,760
No need to work overtime today.

589
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,880
Go home early, everyone.

590
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,520
My wife came to pick me up.

591
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm leaving now.

592
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
See you all tomorrow.

593
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
Nice going, Xu Cheng Ran.

594
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
So many female employees here.

595
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
All wearing short skirts.

596
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,800
It smells so good, Wifey.

597
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,720
What did you make?

598
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,420
(Indoor Plant Decor)

599
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,440
Isn't there a lot to do?

600
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,680
What are we doing at a nursery?

601
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,720
To buy some

602
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,240
flowers for the yard.

603
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,080
Then this is not a part of

604
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,080
architectural design.

605
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,560
It's landscape design.

606
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,160
These are pretty nice.

607
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,920
(Everything seems the same.)

608
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
(Yet, everything seems different.)

609
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
(I'm standing right next to him,)

610
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,920
(but I have to distance myself from him at all times.)

611
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,600
(Our hearts)

612
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,480
(have never been this closer together.)

613
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,640
(But like he said,)

614
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
(our future)

615
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,800
(has never been so unclear)

616
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
(and uncertain.)

617
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
(Although I don't know)

618
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,720
(how we can keep going,)

619
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,080
(as long as I'm by his side,)

620
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,760
(no matter in what way,)

621
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,640
(I'll feel at ease.)

622
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,560
Do you think

623
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,960
Grandma will like this?

624
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,200
She will.

625
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
What were you thinking?

626
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,040
Nothing.

627
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,720
I was wondering whether we have to buy a bunch?

628
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,040
Of course.

629
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
How will we bring everything back?

630
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,520
They do delivery.

631
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,920
Let's keep looking.

632
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,440
We have a pretty wide

633
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,080
variety of plants.

634
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,440
For example, these flamingo flowers over here

635
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,720
imply the blossoming of fortune.

636
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
You could consider buying several.

637
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,480
I've already taken out my share.

638
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,720
The rest

639
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,880
has been transferred to your account.

640
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
I've received it, Zheng.

641
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,200
Thanks.

642
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
Tomorrow, I'll be

643
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,840
away for a while.

644
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,480
I understand.

645
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,240
It's the right move to stay away for a while.

646
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,240
Come back when it's clear.

647
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,720
You're not leaving?

648
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
Why would I leave?

649
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
I have nothing to be afraid of.

650
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Here. Enjoy your trip.

651
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,320
I've read the new proposal.

652
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,520
It's great. I'm very satisfied with it.

653
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,520
As long as all the board members are satisfied.

654
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,160
Actually,

655
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
we're not against this plan.

656
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,720
As long as the expenditures are reasonable,

657
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
there's nothing else wrong with it, right?

658
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,720
You're right.

659
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,240
The current spending plan

660
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,040
was revised

661
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,280
according to the suggestions put forward

662
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,560
by the board members at the last meeting.

663
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,400
I promise to implement it to a tee.

664
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
Good. Great.

665
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,160
Great.

666
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Sure enough, Cheng Ran

667
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
is becoming more and more mature.

668
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,720
Like father, like son.

669
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,640
We're all very pleased that

670
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,080
you're able to take over so soon.

671
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
From now on,

672
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
the group is in your hands.

673
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,880
I'll do my very best.

674
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,120
Oh, right.

675
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
There will be a press conference in a few days.

676
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,480
I invited many journalist friends

677
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,320
to help promote us.

678
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,240
It'll also be live-streamed on the Internet.

679
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
This will be a great opportunity

680
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,480
to build our company's image.

681
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,120
I hope all the board members

682
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,120
can attend.

683
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,400
Such a great opportunity.

684
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
We've got to attend, right?

685
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,320
Exactly.

686
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,560
Alright.

687
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,080
Let me summarize.

688
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,080
We'll all go back you up.

689
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,440
How's that?

690
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,960
Alright?

691
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,840
Sure.

692
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,560
Then, thank you all

693
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,000
in advance.

694
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,600
Okay.

695
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,600
The time for the younger generation has come.

696
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,400
Young and promising indeed.

697
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,520
Yes.

698
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,680
Let me.

699
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,680
Just sit here.

700
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,760
Don't do anything.

701
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,680
Don't touch anything.

702
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Leave everything to me.

703
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,760
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

704
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,680
Let me do it.

705
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,320
I said let me...

706
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,680
Gu Chuan.

707
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,880
Gu Chuan.

708
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,920
What's wrong?

709
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,960
Help me to the charging room.

710
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,640
Okay.

711
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
Come on. Be careful.

712
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,200
Careful.

713
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,480
How do you feel?

714
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,880
Be careful.

715
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Charging.

716
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,400
Charging interrupted.

717
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
What's happening?

718
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Why is it happening?

719
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Charging.

720
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
Charging interrupted.

721
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,040
Gu Chuan.

722
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,320
Gu Chuan. Wake up. Gu Chuan.

723
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,560
Don't do this to me.

724
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,920
Gu Chuan.

725
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,400
Gu Chuan. Wake up. Gu Chuan.

726
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,480
Gu Chuan. You're going to be okay. Gu Chuan.

727
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,680
Gu Chuan.

728
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Charge. Gu Chuan.

729
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,040
Gu Chuan. You'll be okay.

730
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,040
It'll be okay. Gu Chuan.

731
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,840
Charge.

732
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,720
Charge.

733
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Charge.

734
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,400
Charge.

735
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,000
Charging.

736
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,280
You almost scared me to death, Gu Chuan.

737
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
I thought you were leaving

738
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,040
me by myself again.

739
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm fine. Stop crying.

740
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm not crying.

741
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,400
Safe Mode?

742
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,480
Yes. This way, the mechanical heart

743
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,960
will work at minimum capacity,

744
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,280
only maintaining the most basic functions.

745
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,720
But,

746
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,720
it will affect the blood flow.

747
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,880
For example,

748
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,520
it won't

749
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
respond to

750
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,400
human emotions.

751
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,560
The person

752
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,160
will become kind of dull and slow.

753
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,800
But at least,

754
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,200
it'll allow the person to live a little longer.

755
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,920
Wait.

756
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,560
Why do you have to

757
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,040
have this Safe Mode?

758
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,840
To prolong one's life.

759
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,800
This way, at least you'll have enough time

760
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
to say goodbye to this world.

761
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,400
You won't leave the world suddenly.

762
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,120
In other words,

763
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,760
if I'm in the Safe Mode,

764
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,880
that means it's reminding me that

765
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,160
I don't have much time left?

766
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,480
Right.

767
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,480
You can think of it that way.

768
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,520
This...

769
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,800
You're up.

770
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,280
Why are you in a daze?

771
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,880
Let's eat.

772
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,480
Do you remember

773
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
the first time I cooked for you?

774
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
I do.

775
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,480
Back then, I hoped

776
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,080
you could live a warmer and more emotional life.

777
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,760
What about now?

778
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,000
Now,

779
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,120
I want you to be healthy and happy.

780
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
I will.

781
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Eat while it's still hot.

782
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,080
How is it?

783
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,960
It's good.

784
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
Then have some more.

Nothing.

790

I just like looking at you.

791
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360

Director Xu.

807
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,680
Director Xu, you asked for me?

808
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Tang Xu.

809
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,000
You dare to touch my money?

810
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,800
Do you have a death wish?

811
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
Or do you think I'm getting old?

812
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,600
All these years,

813
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,920
I think I've done a lot for you.

814
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,080
Even if the work I've done doesn't get recognized,

815
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,240
the time and effort I put in cannot be denied.

816
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
So I think

817
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,440
I deserve that money.

818
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,680
Tang Xu, so you're saying that

819
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,760
you're keeping this money

820
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,480
no matter what?

821
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
Why? Can't I?

822
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,000
Do you think you should?

823
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,360
Tang Xu.

824
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,480
What you've said is all bollocks.

825
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,640
I've supported you for so many years and

826
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
treated you like my own son.

827
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,120
This is how you repay me?

828
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,720
Don't bother with the pretty words.

829
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Who are you trying to fool?

830
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,320
Answer me.

831
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,400
Will you let Xu Cheng Ran

832
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,800
do something illegal with you?

833
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,400
If what you've said is true,

834
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,320
the two of us are the same to you.

835
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,840
Fine.

836
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,440
I'll transfer the money to him right now.

837
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
Let him be your pawn

838
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,800
for once.

839
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,120
You really are an ingrate.

840
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,920
Ungrateful bastard.

841
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,480
Tang Xu, I'm telling you.

842
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,520
Don't play tricks with me.

843
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,480
Give me back the money right now.

844
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,960
Otherwise, not only will I not spare you,

845
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,560
I won't spare Tang Zheng Cheng either.

846
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
If you dare to lay a finger on him,

847
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,480
I'll make sure all the evidence

848
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
I have on you get out.

849
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,760
You dare to challenge me?

850
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,160
Anyway, I'll drag you down with me.

851
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,000
I know too much about you.

852
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,720
Tang Xu.

853
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,200
If I can be so easily

854
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,080
manipulated by you,

855
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,240
I should get rid of my last name, Xu.

856
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,800
Go check as you wish.

857
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,080
But I can

858
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,960
tell you right now that

859
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,920
the only person who will be

860
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
found guilty is you.

861
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,520
You have three days

862
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
to give me back my money

863
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,880
and get lost.

864
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,960
(Hello.)

865
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,560
(Are you Dr. Peer's assistant,)

866
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,720
(Miss Qing Zi?)

867
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,200
(There is something very important that)

868
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,000
(I'd like to discuss with you.)

869
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,920
(I look forward to hearing back from you.)

870
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,280
(If you could give me your contact details,)

871
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,200
(I would appreciate it. Jiang Xiao Ning.)

872
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,720
Xiao Ning.

873
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,040
Go downstairs and

874
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,160
buy tomorrow's breakfast.

875
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,760
Where is she?

876
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,400
Mom.

877
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,720
What's going on with her?

878
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
What's she doing cooped up

879
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,880
in her room?

880
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,760
Studying.

881
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,720
Studying?

882
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
Ning Ning.

883
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,320
Studying hard.

884
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,200
Okay.

885
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,840
(Sorry, I just saw your email.)

886
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,600
(Here is my contact details...)

887
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
Hello?

888
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
I'm Gu Chuan's girlfriend.

889
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,840
Sorry to contact you out of the blue.

890
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
I have something very important

891
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,240
I'd like to ask you about face-to-face.

892
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm in Shanghai for a business trip.

893
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
You can come meet me.

894
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,760
You're on a business trip in Shanghai?

895
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,680
Could I go meet you?

896
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,520
Okay, great.

897
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,160
Thank you.

898
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,840
(Gu Chuan.)

899
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,800
(I know you won't give up on me.)

900
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,920
(I won't give up on you either.)

901
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,200
Hello, Boss.

902
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,920
Hello.

903
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,160
I'd like to take some time off.

904
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,080
Why?

905
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,000
I want to take Grandma

906
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,440
to get a thorough check-up.

907
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,560
Need to be

908
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,640
vigilant at all times when it comes to seniors.

909
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,520
Grandma's got more and more

910
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,520
episodes of memory loss recently.

911
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,160
Aunty has a bad back, so she can't go.

912
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,480
I'll go with you.

913
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,480
No, that's okay.

914
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,640
It's only a check-up.

915
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,440
Alright.

916
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
If you need anything,

917
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,560
feel free to let me know.

918
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,840
Okay. Thanks, Boss.

919
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,280
You're still calling me "Boss"?

920
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,480
Thanks, my boyfriend.

921
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,920
Hello. Are you Qing Zi?

922
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,080
You must be Miss Jiang.

923
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,960
Please have a seat.

924
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,920
Miss Jiang came by

925
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,880
to ask me

926
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,440
about the mechanical heart, right?

927
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,320
Yes.

928
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
I did some research online.

929
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,040
I want to know

930
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,320
what kind of problem

931
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
is Gu Chuan's mechanical heart having.

932
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,720
I found these symptoms,

933
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,200
but they don't seem to be the same.

934
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
So I want...

935
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,560
Stop looking.

936
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
Mr. Gu's problem

937
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,200
is rare,

938
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,480
not common.

939
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Even when Dr. Peer

940
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,640
was alive,

941
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
he couldn't solve the problem.

942
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,960
What you can find on the Internet

943
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,360
is even less useful.

944
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,080
Is there another way?

945
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,000
Can't it be replaced with a biological heart?

946
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,680
Mr. Gu has been using

947
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,880
a mechanical heart for ten years.

948
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,080
If he were to switch to

949
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,000
a biological heart now,

950
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,520
his survival rate will be very low.
