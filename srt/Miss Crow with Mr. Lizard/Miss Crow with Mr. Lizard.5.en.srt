Mr. Gu,

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,360
did my drawing

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,520
really bring you inspiration?

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
It did help.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm so happy!

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,080
To think that the flower I drew

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
could bring you inspiration.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,040
Not only the flower you drew

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,720
but also your attitude towards life.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,280
I didn't know

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
I could be of such use.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
That's the highest praise

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
I could possibly receive.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
But you suddenly

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
said so much to me,

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
I need some time to digest everything.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,680
Mr. Gu.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
From now on,

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
you can call me Boss.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
Why?

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,000
Before...

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
That was before.

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,520
Didn't you say that

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,400
bosses

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,080
always have a straight face?

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,360
In the future, I hope

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
you'll constantly remind me

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
to not always have a straight face,

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
to be happier.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,800
Yes, Boss.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,200
Also...

53
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,360
Boss, please go on.

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,480
Your drawing is

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,920
really ugly.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,560
I was just drawing casually.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,960
The drawing is ugly, but it's the
thought that counts.

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Boss.

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,480
Signing?

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
That means we've sealed the deal?

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes.

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,920

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,040

Yes, yes, yes!

72

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,560
Are you setting Xiao Ning up for trouble?

177
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
We are us,

178
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
Jiang Xiao Ning is Jiang Xiao Ning.

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
It's different.

180
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,240
Boss,

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm really grateful to you and Man Lin.

182
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Here's to you.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
I don't drink.

184
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,520
It's okay, I'll drink.

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
She finished her drink.

186
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah.

187
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,080
One more thing.

188
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,880
I'd like to ask for your forgiveness.

189
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
What?

190
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
Could you stand up?

191
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,280
I was drinking for liquid courage.

192
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
All my words of gratitude

193
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
are expressed in this hug.

194
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Thank you, Boss.

195
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,560
What is going on?

196
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,440
You called me here

197
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,200
to watch this?

198
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Public confession, a hug filled with love?

199
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,320
Thank you, Man Lin,

200
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,320
thank you,

201
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,160
thank you.

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,960
Xiao Ning must be drunk.

203
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
She drank too much, too much.

204
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's drink to the hug of love.

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,880
Cheers, cheers.

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,960
Let's drink to the hug of love.
Cheers, cheers.

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,600
Cheers.

208
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,520
Cheers, cheers.

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,480
Cheers.

210
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
You and Jiang Xiao Ning.

211
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Don't!

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,920
I know what you're thinking.

213
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,840
There is nothing between me and her.

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,160
You went to meet a big shot like Mr. Qin,

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,840
and you only brought her with you.

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,200
That has got to be the first time in years?

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,040
I just wanted her to know that

218
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
the problems from before

219
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,320
have nothing to do with her.

220
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,840
Chuan,

221
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
if you feel something, just go with it.

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,799
Your eyes say you're taking it seriously.

223
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,480
Everyone is enjoying themselves,

224
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,039
are you sure you want to leave now?

225
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
Yes, I'll leave first.

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,280
Alright.

227
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
Call a designated driver then.

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,800
I won't drop you off.

229
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm going to drop Man Lin off later.

230
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,920
That old pervert He Sheng

231
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
has been after her for a while.

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,640
Now that he has been fired,

233
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
who knows what he'll do?

234
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll drop Man Lin off,

235
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,360
just to make sure she's safe.

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
Alright, I'm leaving it to you.

237
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
Boss! Boss!

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
Boss!

239
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll leave you to it.

240
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,160
Boss.

241
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,040
Wait for me,

242
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
I'll go get the car right now.

243
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
You drank.

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
You want to go to jail for drunk driving?

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,520
Boss.

246
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,280
I'm sorry,

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
I shouldn't have drunk.

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm leaving now.

249
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
See you at the office tomorrow.

250
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
Bye-bye.

251
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
What about giving you a lift?

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,720
It's about to rain.

253
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Boss, I'm pretty sober.

254
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,160
I'm not drunk.

255
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,720
I know which bus to take.

256
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,360
I'm not drunk, not drunk.

257
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,720
Alright.

258
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,280
Boss.

259
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,160
Boss.

260
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,360
You're the boss.

261
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,560
Boss.

262
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,240
I wouldn't have drunk if I had known.

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Could've earned some extra money as a designated driver.

264
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,360
Even now, you're still

265
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
thinking about earning money.

266
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,120
You're really something.

267
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,680
Yes, Boss.

268
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Boss,

269
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,720
you look

270
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,880
kind of handsome.

271
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,440
You really are drunk.

272
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,280
You smiled!

273
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah, you should smile more often.

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,000
You look like a mannequin when you don't smile.

275
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
Okay, okay, okay.

276
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
You're drunk,

277
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,280
so everything you say is right.

278
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
Not drunk.

279
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,640
Not drunk.

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,040
We're here?

281
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,040
Okay.

282
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,880
Thank you for driving me home, Boss.

283
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,760
Are you sure you can get home by yourself alright

284
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,440
in this state?

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,280
I'll be fine.

286
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,160
Don't worry, Boss.

287
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
It's just through here.

288
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
You go home and rest.

289
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
Let me know when you get home.

290
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay.

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Bye, Boss.

292
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,880
You go first.

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm going then.

294
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
Go home.

295
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
I'll be fine.

296
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,720
Bye, Boss.

297
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Bye.

298
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,040
Kind of drunk.

299
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,760
Hopefully, I didn't do anything stupid.

300
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,480
No,

301
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
I can't go home like this.

302
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
Can't let Grandma smell

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,000
the alcohol.

304
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
Let me walk it off

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,240
before going home.

306
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Zhao Yan.

307
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
Why are you here?

308
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
To discuss our collaboration

309
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,320
with Manager Wei

310
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,680
and to treat you to dinner.

311
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm on a diet. I'm not eating.

312
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,480
Speak to Manager Wei directly

313
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,640
about the collaboration.

314
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Stop resisting. You need a man.

315
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Can you get a mirror

316
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
to look at yourself?

317
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
Whether or not I need a man

318
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
has nothing to do with you.

319
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
Let go of me.

320
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,640
Give me a chance,

321
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
and give yourself

322
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,960
a chance.

323
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
Let go, you filthy woman!

324
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,520
Cursing me out?

325
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
I should be okay now.

326
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,680
Boss?

327
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,520
Hey Jiang Xiao Ning,

328
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,640
are you home yet?

329
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
I... am...

330
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,440
home.

331
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Don't worry, Boss.

332
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,920
I'm fine.

333
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,480
What's that sound?

334
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,440
It's nothing, Boss.

335
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,880
Jiang Xiao Ning,

336
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
tell me the truth.

337
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,920
Are you not home yet?

338
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,440
Boss,

339
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,160
I didn't lie to you on purpose.

340
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
I was scared that Grandma

341
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,360
would smell the alcohol on me.

342
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
I wanted to get some air

343
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,200
and get rid of the alcohol smell.

344
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Hurry.

345
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,160
Boss,

346
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,840
I met someone even drunker than me.

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Compared to him,

348
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm considered sober.

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,480
Hi,

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,160
have some water.

351
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Thank you.

352
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,480
You're welcome.

353
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
He Sheng?

354
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
He Sheng?

355
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,000
Little Miss Designated Driver.

356
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,800
You… What are you doing!

357
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,840
It's really you.

358
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,840
What a coincidence.

359
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
I've been looking for you desperately

360
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,360
but to no avail.

361
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,880
Who knew you would

362
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
come to me.

363
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,880
Give me back my phone.

364
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,400
I don't know you.

365
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,040
You've drunk too much.

366
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,360
I've drunk too much?

367
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,640
Could I have found you if I didn't drink too much?

368
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,320
I...

369
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Let me tell you, Little Miss Designated Driver.

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,080
You're really something.

371
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
You caused me to lose my job.

372
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,640
Now the company

373
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,920
wants to search my past records.

374
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,280
Today, I'll show you

375
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,120
who you can mess with

376
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,400
and who you should never mess with

377
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
in your lifetime.

378
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,960
Let go of me.

379
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,080
-You dare to hit me?
-What's wrong with you?

380
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Let go of me.

381
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Let go of me.

382
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,240
Let's go.

383
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,220
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

384
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,000
Move it.

385
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Mr. He.

386
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
-Let's go.
-What are you doing?

387
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
You'll find out soon enough.

388
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,560
Move it.

389
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,120
Let's go.

390
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,040
Let go of me.

391
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Let go of you?

392
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,320
You wish.

393
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,520
Let go of me.

394
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,160
Move it.

395
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,600
Mr. He.

396
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,680
Mr. He.

397
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
Mr. He.

398
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,480
Mr. He, what are you doing! Mr. He!

399
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:23,840
What am I doing?

400
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,280
You'll find out soon.

401
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,680
What are you doing?

402
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,240
Mr. He.

403
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,240
Mr. He.

404
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,000
Little Miss Designated Driver

405
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,600
What do you think you're doing?

406
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,120
Boss.

407
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,000
Gu,

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,840
I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you.

409
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,680
Stop...stop...

410
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,360
stop fighting!

411
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,640
Stop fighting, stop fighting! Stop...

412
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,680
Boss!

413
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,000
Stop fighting!

414
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Stop, stop fighting!

415
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,800
To hell with you.

416
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,319
-I'm going to kill you.
-Boss!

417

Little Miss Designated Driver.

418
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,240

I'm sorry.

I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

453
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm sorry, Boss.

454
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,880
Jiang Xiao Ning,

455
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
you talk too much.

456
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm sorry, Boss.

457
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know what to do.

458
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm sorry.

459
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,840
Mr. Xu!

460
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,760
-Mr. Xu!
- Xiao Ning.

461
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
-Boss.
-Chuan.

462
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,040
What happened?

463
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
How did this happen?

464
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
He Sheng drank too much.

465
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
He bumped into me and wanted to take revenge.

466
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,160
This piece of trash

467
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
dared to do something like that.

468
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,800
But thankfully,

469
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,720
Boss came to my rescue on time.

470
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,680
Chuan,

471
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,640
are you okay?

472
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm fine.

473
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,280
Xiao Ning and I

474
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,920
will go to the hospital to get patched up first.

475
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,160
We'll leave He Sheng to you.

476
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,240
(Surgical department)

477
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,920
Boss,

478
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,000
where did you go?

479
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,720
Has your wound been bandaged?

480
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
Yes, it has.

481
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,880
That's good.

482
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,960
The doctor prescribed some medication.

483
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,880
I'll go and get it.

484
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,200
You can rest here for a while.

485
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,480
Okay.

486
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,280
Tell me, what exactly happened?

487
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,400
This guy's name is He Sheng.

488
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,280
He drank too much

489
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,320
and assaulted my friend.

490
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't know what happened but

491
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,120
then he fainted.

492
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm guessing

493
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,760
he has done too many bad things.

494
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,720
It's karma.

495
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Check this person's records.

496
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
He was indeed electrocuted.

497
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
In this thunderstorm,

498
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,040
especially outside,

499
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,200
in an open area.

500
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
He got electrocuted.

501
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,720
The IV helped,

502
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,800
he'll wake up soon.

503
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,920
Thank you.

504
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,240
No worries.

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,840
Where's your friend?

506
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
Injured.

507
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,080
Receiving treatment now.

508
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,640
Miss Officer,

509
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,520
you need to ensure justice

510
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,960
is served to evil people like him.

511
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
Mind your manners.

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Don't electrocute me.

513
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,600
Don't...

514
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
Don't electrocute me.

515
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,400
Sir.

516
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,120
Don't electrocute me.

517
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
Sir.

518
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,120
Sir...

519
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,480
Sir.

520
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
Let me ask you,

521
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,640
what happened?

522
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,720
Police?

523
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,160
P… Police?

524
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,240
Officer.

525
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,080
I...

526
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,880
Officer,

527
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
let… let me tell you.

528
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,400
You need to believe me.

529
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
Everything I'm saying is true.

530
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,480
That person releases electricity.

531
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,360
That guy released electricity and
electrocuted me.

532
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,880
He electrocuted me twice.

533
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,840
I was scared to death. I'm telling you,

534
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,240
everything I'm saying is true.

535
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
It was so scary.

536
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:07,920
Sir,

537
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,440
do you remember how much you drank?

538
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,080
No,

539
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm telling you, Officer,

540
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,280
listen to me.

541
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,680
Have you seen the comics about

542
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Pikachu?

543
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,600
Let me tell you,

544
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,840
he's Pikachu.

545
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,160
He electrocuted me.

546
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,840
He...

547
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,640
Movies work too. The Flash.

548
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,880
He's the Flash.

549
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Let go.

550
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,760
That's enough, He Sheng.

551
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,520
How much have you drunk?

552
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
You reek of alcohol.

553
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,640
You

554
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,720
assaulted someone

555
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,600
and now you're telling lies.

556
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,640
Lying to the police.

557
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,080
Just you wait,

558
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,280
you're going to be punished
to the full extent of the law.

559
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
He's lying.

560
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,360
Listen,

561
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,960
his friend Gu Chuan

562
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
is so scary.

563
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,800
Officer,

564
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,720
-you must…
-Stop being so loud!

565
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,200
This is a hospital.

566
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,160
Be quiet.

567
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,320
You're too much.

568
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,960
We've verified his identity.

569
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,160
His name is He Sheng.

570
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,360
He's involved in a financial crime case

571
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,920
and two sexual harassment cases.

572
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,440
He's on bail pending trial.

573
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

574
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh no, oh no.

575
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,360
My head hurts, I feel awful.

576
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,960
I feel awful, I feel awful.

577
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,760
I don't know anything.

578
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm telling you,

579
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,560
stop pretending.

580
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,960
How about this.

581
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,160
Watch over him.

582
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,080
When he's sober,

583
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,080
bring him to the station for questioning.

584
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,680
Okay.

585
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,800
You.

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,320
Get in touch with your friend.

587
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,160
We need to

588
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,800
verify the situation

589
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,440
with the other two witnesses.

590
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,600
They're here in this hospital.

591
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
Is this your friend's?

592
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes.

593
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay, let's go.

594
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,120
My head hurts.

595
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,080
Let me sleep a little longer, just a little longer.

596
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,200
I feel awful.

597
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
He Sheng had too much to drink.

598
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,520
I gave him a bottle of water to drink.

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,200
I didn't have time to react,

600
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
then he snatched my phone away.

601
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
He blamed me for causing him to lose his job

602
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
and dragged me off by force.

603
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Luckily, Boss arrived just in time.

604
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
He even used the beer bottle to attack us.

605
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,520
My mind just went blank.

606
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,000
It was

607
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,000
raining heavily then.

608
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,200
The thunder was very loud.

609
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
There was a lot of lightning.

610
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,440
Then He Sheng fainted.

611
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
Boss and I both got injured.

612
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,120
And then,

613
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,920
we came to the hospital

614
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,880
to get our wounds treated.

615
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,600
So according to you,

616
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,080
he first obstructed you

617
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
at the entrance of your community.

618
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,840
Yes.

619
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,240
I think I more or less understand
the situation now.

620
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,360
Go back and rest well

621
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,800
tonight.

622
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280
We'll search the

623
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
surveillance records at the entrance
of your community

624
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
to verify what you said.

625
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,800
As for He Sheng,

626
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,200
I'll wait until he's sober

627
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,600
to continue with my questioning.

628
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,000
We may reach out to you

629
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,280
for your assistance and cooperation

630
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,360
in the future.

631
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
I’ll definitely cooperate.

632
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,440
Even if they don't cooperate,

633
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,920
I'll make sure they cooperate.

634
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,800
Okay,

635
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,120
I'll be taking my leave.

636
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,040
Let me see you off.

637
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
It's okay, thank you.

638
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,760
I have the police car.

639
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,280
At least, let me walk you to the hospital entrance.

640
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,120
Boss,

641
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,560
are you okay?

642
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,560
You don't look too good.

643
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Drive me home.

644
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,760
Not waiting for Mr. Xu?

645
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,680
Let's not wait.

646
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,680
Okay.

647
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,840
I already said you didn't have to see me off.

648
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,760
I insist.

649
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,080
Sorry that you had come here so late at night.

650
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,360
Plus, there are a lot of weirdos out there nowadays.

651
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,880
A pretty police officer like you

652
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,360
should be careful out there.

653
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,560
We may contact you

654
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,880
if we need anything else in the future.

655
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,480
Okay.

656
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,520
Also, ma'am,

657
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,520
that He Sheng

658
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,600
has always been a drunkard.

659
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,560
Lying is in his nature.

660
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,320
Make sure you're not

661
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,200
fooled by him.

662
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Thank you for your reminder.

663
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,440
Goodbye.

664
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,160
Bye-bye.

665
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,920
Come out.

666
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm telling you.

667
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Growing up,

668
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,600
even my parents haven’t ever hit me.

669
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,840
You're too violent.

670
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm telling you,

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,880
if the test results show that

672
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,520
something is wrong with me,

673
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,600
I'm so going to make you pay.

674
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,360
And

675
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,080
even if you had to hit me,

676
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,080
you didn't have to hit me so hard.

677
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,520
Let’s say you had to hit me this hard,

678
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,520
you didn't have to hit me on the face.

679
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,520
Listen,

680
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
if I don't get any women in the future...

681
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,160
No,

682
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,120
if my face is ruined,

683
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
what am I supposed to do?

684
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,200
Don't come near me.

685
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,160
A grown man whining and weeping like that,

686
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
what an embarrassment.

687
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,600
Wait, who are you?

688
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
What has this got to do with you?

689
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,440
My mouth is my own,

690
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
I can say what I want.

691
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,280
Is it your business?

692
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,520
Do you believe I'll hit you?

693
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
You want to hit me?

694
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,200
You can't even win a fight with her

695
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,440
and you want to fight me?

696
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,120
I wouldn't mind

697
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,560
compensating you for your injuries
along with this pretty lady.

698
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
But can your body...

699
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Are you going to get tested for your injuries?

700
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:30,800
Yes.

701
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,480
Just you wait.

702
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,560
Do you still remember...

703
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,480
Boss,

704
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
be careful.

705
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm fine.

706
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,320
You can go home now.

707
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,680
Are you sure?

708
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,920
But

709
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm still worried about your condition.

710
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,280
How about I wait a while?

711
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,840
Okay, up to you.

712
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
But don't disturb me.

didn't even tell me before leaving.

727
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,080
I'm hungry.

728
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Buy me something to eat.

729
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,080
Then starve to death.

730
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,920
How about I use the money meant
to pay for your tests

731
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
for your funeral?

732
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,760
No, you...

733
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,960
What was wrong

734
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,760
with my taste?

735
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,680
How did I fall for you?

736
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,360
Looking at you,

737
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
who would want you?

738
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
Me.

739
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
You do have bad taste.

740
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,840
You don't even fancy

741
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,400
such a pretty lady.

742
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,280
Get your hand off me.

743
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm helping you.

744
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't need it.

745
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,560
Serves you right.

746
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
If you touch me again,

747
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
you'll end up like him.

748
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,360
And you,

749
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,400
are you going to get tested or not?

750
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,720
I don't have time to waste on you.

751
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,400
No, no, no.

752
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
-Not testing.
-Me!

753
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,840
I want an examination of my wounds.

754
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,160
Trying to pull a fast one?

755
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,760
No.

756
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,800
If it's not convenient for you today,

757
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,040
I'll make an appointment with you.

758
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,360
Let's add each other on WeChat.

759
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Do you want to scan me or I scan you?

760
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
Do you want me to kick you?

761
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,680
Yes.

762
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,600
As long as it's something you're giving me,

763
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
I want it.

764
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,920
What's the situation?

765
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
Who called the police.

766
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,960
Officer.

767
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,400
Why is it you again?

768
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Hello, Grandma.

769
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
Xiao Ning.

770
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,280
It's so late, why aren't you home yet?

771
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,040
I'm at the office, working on a project.

772
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,480
We were notified that we need to
work overtime last-minute.

773
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,040
Go to sleep,

774
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
don't wait up for me.

775
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
Burning the midnight oil is bad for your health.

776
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,160
Take care of your health.

777
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
Don't worry, Grandma.

778
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Sleep early.

779
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,360
I'm hanging up.

780
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,040
Boss.

781
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,120
Boss, are you okay?

782
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,440
Boss.

783
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,040
If there's anything,

784
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,520
call me anytime. I'm downstairs.

785
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Take it easy.

786
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,520
So you're sure you want to settle?

787
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes.

788
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,320
It wasn't me who called the police
in the first place.

789
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
What's the situation with you?

790
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,360
Officer,

791
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,480
as long as she's willing to compensate,

792
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,960
I can resolve matters peacefully.

793
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,160
Officer,

794
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,760
can I call the police for workplace
sexual harassment?

795
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Zhao Yan,

796
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,360
don't push it, you!

797
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,560
I initially didn't want to

798
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,720
use public resources

799
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,600
and bring trouble to the police.

800
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,320
There was a reason why I hit you.

801
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,280
If we're really going to haggle over every ounce,

802
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,800
it's not certain who should be compensated.

803
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,640
Fine.

804
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,760
Since the police are here today.

805
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,840
Let's forget it.

806
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,680
Are you okay?

807
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm fine, thank you.

808
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,840
Then I'll get going.

809
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Take care.

810
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Stay away from this person.

811
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,239
Stay safe.

812
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,760
How about I drive you home?

813
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,520
That won't be necessary.

814
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,360
Why are you smiling like that?

815
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,360
I'll never forget

816
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,560
what you did to me earlier.

817
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,760
You want revenge?

818
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,639
I'll take you on any time.

819
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,639
You seriously humiliated me,

820
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,719
but somehow, I kind of liked it.

821
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,280
Anyway, it's

822
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,080
a magical feeling.

823
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,960
I've never felt that way before.

824
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,480
I don't add strangers on WeChat.

825
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,040
You hit me.

826
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,520
It wouldn't hurt

827
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,239
to send me a red pocket.

828
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,400
This way, we can write off

829
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,239
whatever happened between us.

830
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,840
Plus,

831
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,680
after you add me,

832
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,920
you can delete me.

833
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,200
You hitting me is a fact.

834
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,760
A red pocket is not too much to ask for, right?

835
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,500
(Zhao Yan's red pocket)

836
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
(Delete contact)

837
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,720
Done.

838
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,440
Want me to hit you again?

839
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,400
Sure.

840
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
If you want to.

841
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,440
Weirdo.

842
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,400
Look,

843
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,280
now that

844
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,280
we're starting over,

845
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,320
shouldn't we

846
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
re-introduce ourselves?

847
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,960
Hello, Zhao Yan.

848
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,040
I'm Xu Cheng Ran.

849
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,560
How did you know my name?

850
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,120
I heard that person

851
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,800
call you by your name.

852
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,120
I'm not interested in getting to know you.

853
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,760
Don't follow me.

854

868
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,000
(Dr. P, Mobile)

869
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,120
Hello?

870
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,320
Gu,

871
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
what happened?

872
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,320
I received a warning that says

873
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,840
your heart is discharging a high
amount of electricity.

874
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
It was an accident.

875
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,720
Doctor,

876
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,240
why did I lose consciousness

877
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,160
for around ten seconds?

878
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,760
Does it have to do with the discharge?

879
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,240
No, no, no.

880
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,560
That's a protective mechanism

881
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,760
in case of an overload.

882
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,840
When the mechanical heart

883
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,000
discharges too much electricity,

884
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,160
the system will take

885
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,400
around ten seconds to reboot

886
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,520
in order to protect the device.

887
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Backup power will also be
activated simultaneously.

888
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,240
But you need to be careful.

889
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,400
The reboot is very dangerous.

890
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,760
If it takes too long to reboot,

891
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,920
brain hypoxia

892
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,760
will put your life in danger.

893
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,360
Okay,

894
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,320
I got it.

895
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,440
Gu,

896
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,520
are you in love?

897
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,120
No.

898
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,600
Gu,

899
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,440
before I resolve these issues,

900
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,880
make sure you keep

901
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,760
your emotions under control.

902
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Falling in love

903
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
will cause excitement

904
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
and elevate your heart rate.

905
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,600
Your mechanical heart will discharge electricity

906
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
and malfunction.

907
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,280
Holding hands,

908
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
hugging,

909
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,840
kissing,

910
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,440
intimate physical contact...

911
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,560
Every single fluctuation in your
emotions will cause

912
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,600
fluctuations in your heart function.

913
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,480
So, falling in love

914
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
is a very dangerous thing for you.

915
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:39,920
Stop fighting!

916
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,040
Boss!

917
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,440
Boss!

918
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,120
Gu, are you still there?

919
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,840
Gu?

920
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,880
I'm listening.

921
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,880
Don't be so pessimistic.

922
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,320
Give me some more time,

923
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,440
I'll find a solution.

924
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,280
A solution?

925
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,640
You've been saying that

926
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,600
for ten years.

927
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,440
Where is the solution?

928
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,400
I've heard enough.

929
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,600
I'm hanging up.

930
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,240
