You're still here.

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
The dimensions are off

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
and the proportions are wrong.

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400

you used too much glue.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,400
seeing

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,480
something this sloppy.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,520
What should I do now?

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,360
What else can we do?

55

(Self-heating HotPot, mushroom beef claypot rice)

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
Boss,

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,280
sorry about

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
what just happened.

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
I thought I measured it

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,080
very precisely.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,640
I didn't expect you to

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,840
identify the problem in the blink of an eye.

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,400
The construction industry is a matter
closely tied to life safety.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
There's no room for error

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
in any aspect,

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,840
including the models.

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Got it.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,200
I will make sure to

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,960
learn from you, Boss.

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Redo it tomorrow.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,520
Show it to me after you're done.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,400
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,520
Boss,

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
let me drive you home.

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,360
Sure.

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
There's something on your face.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,960
This side.

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
(No way.)

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
(I didn't touch the elevator.)

81
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,080
(No way,)

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,280
(not again!)

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
(Data is normal.)

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,800
(There shouldn't be any electric discharge.)

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
(Is the watch no longer accurate?)

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,440

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
(scenario like this.)

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,200
Boss,

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,480
Why do you apologize?

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
I don't know.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm always out of luck

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,440
and it seems like it's affecting you now.

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,920
Don't apologize if you haven't
done something wrong.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,880
What's wrong with the elevator?

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
It's malfunctioning.

99
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,200
It's locked.

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,040
But don't worry.

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
We'll send someone now.

102
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,620
♪Pretend that you're happy♪

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Scared?

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
A little.

105
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
Boss, are you alright?

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm good.

107
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm used to it.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,640
The quality of this elevator is this bad?

109
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,840
It's not the elevator's problem.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,280
It's just I

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,520
run into problems like this all the time.

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
For me, it's just Mercury retrograde.

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
Happens 365 days a year. I'm used to it.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
It lasts super long.

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't know outstanding people like you

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,520
would be out of luck too.

117
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Have you heard of

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,240
Festinger's theory?

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,120
What theory?

120
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
Festinger is an

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,040
American social psychologist.

122
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,880
He has a

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
famous theory,

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
called the Festinger theory.

125
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,480
It states that 10 percent

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
of things that happen in life

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,640
are caused by what happened

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,200
to you.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
The other 90 percent

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
depends on how you react

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
to the 10 percent of things

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,240
that happened to you.

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
It's just saying that no matter how hard
you try to avoid it

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
or to prevent it,

136
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
bad things will always happen.

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
You have no control over

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,320
that 10 percent.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,200
The other 90 percent

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,640
all depends on your

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
mentality and actions.

142
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
So,

143
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,600
bad things will always happen.

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Don't think that your bad luck

145
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
drags other people down.

146
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
I think I understand now.

147
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,400
Actually,

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,800
I want to bring happiness

149
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,600
to the people around me too.

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
But I always

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,160
seem to bring bad luck to them.

152
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,280
That's why I'm a little upset.

153
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,720
What's your definition of happiness?

154
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Happiness...

155
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,800
When I was young,

156
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
wearing pretty princess dresses

157
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,760
was happiness.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,760
But now,

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
as long as I can earn enough money

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
to cover next month's living expenses,

161
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll be very happy.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,040
My aunt

163
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,080
had lots of plans.

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,760
However, after her back injury,

165
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
she told me that

166
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,880
good health

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,760
is happiness beyond what one could wish for.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Definitely.

169
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
Good health

170
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
is happiness beyond what one could wish for.

171
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Boss,

172
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,760
what's your definition of happiness?

173
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
Maybe winning the Jin An Award.

174
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
I know that award!

175
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,560
Many architects dream of winning it.

176
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
Is it because winning that award

177
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,400
will make you famous

178
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
and punch a ticket to the international market?

179
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I'll retire after I win the award.

180
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Maybe

181
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,760
getting myself ready to leave the industry.

182
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
How can you do that!

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
You are so

184
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
gifted and talented.

185
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
Others can only dream of

186
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
your gift and talent!

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,880
I appreciate you

188
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,760
trying to flatter me,

189
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,160
even in a moment like this.

190
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't care.

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
You can't retire.

192
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
Who will I assist at work after you retire?

193
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
You're so talented.

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
If I don't absorb some of

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,120
your talent from you,

196
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm not quitting.

197
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't retire!

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,280
Fine.

199
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,920
Make sure to

200
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,280
always be my assistant,

201
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
no matter where I go.

202
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
Anyone in there?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,760
Yes!

204
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
Come, you two.

205
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Quickly.

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
You can go first.

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Boss, you go first.

208
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
Just go, hurry.

209
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,840
It's ok.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Just pull me out

211
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
with a rope later.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,960
Step on here.

213
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,400
No, definitely not.

214
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,160
My conscience will feel condemned.

215
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,600
How can an employee step on her boss.

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,560
Hurry up.

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Boss,

218
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
give me your hand.

219
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,880
Come on.

220
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
Give me your hand.

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Big brother,

222
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,520
I wished for

223
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,160
mom and dad to wake up soon

224
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
and for you to be safe and sound.

225
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,520
We'll get out of here together.

226
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,560
You're Mr. Gu, right?

227
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
Weird.

228
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,880
Why do I get this familiar feeling

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,640
every time I hold her hand?

230
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,480
Boss,

231
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,960
are you okay?

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm fine.

233
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
What do you think

234
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,120
is the significance of

235
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,760
architectural design?

236
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,600
My dad used to be

237
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
an architect.

238
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,360
But he only designed

239
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
residential buildings.

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
He used to always take me to

241
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
the buildings that he designed

242
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,040
and tell me

243
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
that he was the one who designed this

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
and that.

245
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,400
After that,

246
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,440
whenever I pass by those buildings

247
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,280
and see the people inside, I'd think that

248
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,960
my dad is really awesome.

249
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,680
Because the buildings he designed

250
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
allowed so many people to own a home.

251
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
Maybe this is the meaning

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,560
of doing architectural design.

253
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,360
Is your dad

254
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,840
still doing this?

255
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,600
He is no longer with us.

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
My mom and dad

257
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
passed away

258
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,840
when I was 14.

259
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,240
It's okay.

261
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,800
I don't mind bringing this up.

262
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
It has been many years.

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
I have fully accepted it.

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
The reason that

265
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't bring it up is because

266
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,440
I don't want other people to feel sorry for me,

267
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,320
to pity me.

268
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Both for life and for work,

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
I want to prove myself

270
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,480
with my ability.

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,960
You did it.

272
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,440
A very good friend of mine

273
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,200
said that too!

274
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,000
Boss,

275
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm going to leave now.

276
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,600
Be safe.

277
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,640
Boss,

278
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,360
thank you!

279
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
What for?

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,760
(Boss,)

281
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
(I wanted to say)

282
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,480
(thank you)

283
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
(for what you said in the elevator.)

284
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,720
(This was the first time)

285
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,320
(that I felt like having bad luck)

286
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,280
(isn't all that troublesome.)

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
(I'll follow)

288
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,040
(what Fetinsger said)

289
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
(and adjust my mindset.)

290
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,880
(But Boss,)

291
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
(you can't retire!)

292
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,560
(It's Festinger.)

293
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,160
Hello, doctor.

294
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
I was just going to call you.

295
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,200
All of a sudden, I feel this chest pain

296
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
and I have trouble breathing.

297
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,560
What's wrong?

298
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Is there anything

299
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,680
I can do to help?

300
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,280
Seems like the person at work today

301
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,800
is a different doctor.

302
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,760
Are you talking about

303
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
my alternate identity?

304
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,080
My doctor told me that

305
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,560
geniuses are just like me.

306
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm a genius after all.

307
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Let's get down to business.

308
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,560
Ever since the last update,

309
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
I feel like my heart

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
has become more unstable.

311
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,080
Did you run into

312
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,680
a dangerous situation?

313
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,600
I experienced excessive discharge.

314
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,840
Really?

315
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,200
You finally

316
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,720
had a crush on someone?

317
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
Your heart had been very stable

318
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,960
for the past ten years,

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,240
but the data had become strange

320
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,160
very recently.

321
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
Did you meet someone

322
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,760
very special?

323
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,800
Why are you happy about it?

324
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
I remember you telling me

325
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
to not have a person like that in my life.

326
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,120
Forget what he said.

327
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,760
Just listen to me.

328
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,120
If you've really met

329
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,400
this special someone,

330
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
make sure to tell me.

331
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
If,

332
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,160
I'm saying if,

333
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I really find this person.

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,600
Is there any way

335
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,000
to stabilize my data?

336
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

337
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,840
Then why would I tell you?

338
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
I can change the color

339
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,600
of the built-in light of your mechanical heart

340
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
to pink.

341
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,600
This way it fits your mood better.

342
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
Are you kidding me?

343
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,640
Okay, okay, calm down.

344
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,520
I'll try to come up with ideas to help.

345
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
My ideas and the other person's ideas

346
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,000
are different.

347
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
Gu Chuan,

348
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,440
life is short.

349
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
This heart

350
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
is there for you to survive.

351
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,800
But living and surviving

352
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
are different.

353
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
Do you understand?

354
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,480
I don't want to give you false hope,

355
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,880
but I'll try my best.

356
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,240
Improving your mechanical heart

357
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,960
is the most important thing in my life.

358
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,200
Cool.

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Thank you,

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,880
thank you.

361
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
You have to understand that

362
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,880
I am not only a doctor,

363
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm also a scientist.

364
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,800
I know.

365
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,720
The really crazy ones.

366
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,880
Saving lives is my job.

367
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm happy that you are alive.

368
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
But I don't want you to

369
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
become handicapped too early.

370
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
You have to love and protect yourself.

371
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,200
There are some things

372
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,760
that you really can't say for sure.

373
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,560
Everyone wants me to live.

374
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm the only one who doesn't.

375
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,120
Ning Ning, sit down.

376
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,400
Get some rest.

377
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,520
Everything has been painted.

378
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,280
It only cost me a few hundred yuan.

379
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,600
You're so good at saving money.

380
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
You're talking like

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
a couple hundred yuan isn't money.

382
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
It's not money,

383
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,400
it's my life.

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,640
Thank you for buying all this delicious food.

385
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,040
Come on.

386
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,040
Cheers!

387
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,360
Is there anyone in your company

388
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,280
called Xu Cheng Ran?

389
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,760
He's a partner of my boss.

390
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,120
He's not an architect. He's an investor.

391
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,360
Do you know each other?

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,160
He's not a good person.

393
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
Stay away from him.

394
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Really?

395
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,720
I think Mr. Xu is really nice.

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
He's always smiley

397
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,760
and looks very easy-going.

398
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,480
Is he trying to ask you out on a date?

399
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Let's get tipsy.

400
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,640
Tell me about it.

401
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,900
What happened?

402
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:32,960
What exactly happened?

403
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,040
Kind of.

404
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,600
But trust me,

405
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
he promised me that

406
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
he won't bother you.

407
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
Also you know what,

408
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,480
every time he comes near me,

409
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
my brain just goes...

410
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,280
You know what this is?

411
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,640
My playboy radar!

412
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,040
My playboy radar

413
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,320
is never wrong.

414
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,560
Your ex-boyfriend was a player.

415
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,800
How did you not notice?

416
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
I got this radar

417
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
because of him.

418
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
And this Xu Cheng Ran

419
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,640
just looks like one of those

420
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,680
playboys playing around.

421
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
He's also super greasy.

422
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,920
What you're saying makes sense to me.

423
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't think Mr. Xu is greasy.

424
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,320
I think he's nice.

425
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,000
What's wrong with you, Jiang Xiao Ning?

426
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,360
Why are you speaking for him?

427
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
Whose side are you on?

428
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,880
No, I'm definitely on your side.

429
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,640
On your side.

430
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,680
But I think it's normal for him

431
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,400
to like you.

432
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,360
If I were a guy,

433
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,200
I'd like you too.

434
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,960
You're gorgeous and have a fun personality.

435
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,320
And have a nice figure!

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,080
Why do I feel like

437
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,720
you're hinting at something?

438
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,160
Maybe my body is nothing like yours,

439
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,880
but

440
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm still a girl!

441
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
Do you want some

442
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
papaya milk?

443
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
It stimulates growth.

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,960
I checked.

445
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,520
It's a myth. It doesn't work.

446
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,680
You really looked it up?

447
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,640
Look at you!

448
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
But to be honest,

449
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
I'm very interested in

450
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
the relationship between you and your boss.

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,560
Maybe let him stimulate

452
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,440
your female hormones?

453
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,840
Stop.

454
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,040
Don't think about my boss

455
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
in your dirty way.

456
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
He's the swan.

457
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm at most a toad.

458
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm not dreaming about this.

459
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,280
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

460
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,600
There's nothing wrong with having
a crush on someone.

461
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,600
Falling in love with someone isn't wrong.

462
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
There's also nothing wrong with trying to
get someone to date you.

463
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
What's wrong is,

464
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
once we start giving

465
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,480
and don't see results,

466
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,520
all we do is complain

467
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
or blame ourselves.

468
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,200
For someone like your boss,

469
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,520
even if you get hurt

470
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,440
and don't get anything in return,

471
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I think it's worth it.

472
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,560
Because he will change your life.

473
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,560
Change my life?

474
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,080
From being a girl to being a woman.

475
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,120
Cheers.

476
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,000
Boss.

477
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Mr. Xu?

478
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,400
Mr. Xu,

479
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
did you not sleep well?

480
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
Why didn't Yan Yan

481
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,080
answer my call?

482
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,320
She doesn't

483
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,480
reply at all.

484
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,480
Sister Yan Yan

485
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,280
is very passive.

486
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
I want to see her.

487
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,680
Without seeing her,

488
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
I can't eat and sleep.

489
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm getting thinner and weaker.

490
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,440
I'm just not okay anymore!

491
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,120
But this is

492
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,080
between the two of you.

493
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,360
Ask her out!

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Me?

495
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,880
Who else?

496
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,240
I can't, even if I want to!

497
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
But Mr. Xu,

498
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,200
as someone on her side,

499
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
I have to be responsible for her happiness.

500
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
Do you like her?

501
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
I've already become this sad,

502
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
it can't be fake.

503
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,920
Will you treat her well?

504
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes!

505
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,920
I certainly and definitely will!

506
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,480
Xiao Ning,

507
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,440
I beg you.

508
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,640
Help me out this one time.

509
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
I just want to see her again.

510
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
Regardless of how it goes,

511
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,880
I'll give up.

512
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,480
(Jiang Xiao Ning: Food stall tonight?)

513
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,920
(Zhao Yan: Okay, see you at our usual spot.)

514
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
I sent you the

515
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,440
location of the food stall.

516
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
You must...

517
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
Jiang Xiao Ning.

518
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,520
From now on,

519
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,560
you are my best friend,

520
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
one of my best friends.

521
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,600
If Gu Chuan ever does something to you,

522
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,080
I'll be on your side.

523
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,760
Okay, tell me.

524
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
Do you think how I was just now

525
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
will move her?

526
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,120
You moved me.

527
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:46,820

528
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,460
(Chuan Design Studios)

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,760
Brother Kai.

530
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,360
Xiao Ning.

531
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,160
What did Mr. Xu want from you?

532
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,720
Not me, he was looking for Mr. Gu.

533
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,480
Where's Mr. Gu?

534
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't know.

535
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
He texted me this morning

536
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
and told me I don't need to pick him up.

537
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,960
He might be resting at home.

538
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,800
I called him more than 10 times.

539
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,440
He never picked up.

540
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,480
How about you go and check on him?

541
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,880
Me?

542
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
Definitely not me.

543
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
You're his assistant.

544
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,400
Sure, I'll go now.

545
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,480
Xiao Ning.

546
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,800
Get him some food

547
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,600
on the way there.

548
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,880
Mr. Gu's fridge

549
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,560
needs to be stocked.

550
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,400
Sure!

551
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,240
Boss.

552
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,720
Did I not tell you

553
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,840
to not come and pick me up today?

554
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,680
Brother Kai said he called you a bunch of times

555
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,440
and you never picked up.

556
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
He wanted me to check whether you're home or not.

557
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,440
He also said that

558
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,840
your fridge needs to be stocked.

559
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
You seem to have a lot of free time.

560
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you still remember that model from yesterday?

561
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,760
Aunty, I’m really sorry.

562
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
Our company is currently busy with

563
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
an exhibition center project.

564
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,080
I wasn't able to find the time

565
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,800
to spend with you.

566
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,760
Doesn't matter.

567
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
We don't need to see each other.

568
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,080
Gu!

569
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay,

570
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,000
go and do the check-in first.

571
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Come, Man Lin.

572
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,520
Is Uncle okay?

573
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Is he not happy?

574
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
He's okay. He's always like that.

575
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
I have no one else to talk to about this,

576
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,680
except for you.

577
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,320
Aunty, just say it. it's fine.

578
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,320
Our Chuan

579
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,280
has been living a lonely life these past years.

580
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,520
He doesn't get along well with others.

581
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,400
He doesn't have any other friends

582
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,960
besides

583
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,040
you and Cheng Ran.

584
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm worried that

585
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,040
this isn't a long-term solution.

586
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,880
As time passes,

587
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,840
he will develop

588
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
mental health problems.

589
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,400
I understand.

590
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
We'll spend more time

591
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,280
with him.

592
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,240
That would be great.

593
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,000
That way,

594
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
we don't have to worry as much.

595
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,280
What I really want to say is that

596
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,760
he finally found a girl

597
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,840
that he likes.

598
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,520
A girl that he likes?

599
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
Yes.

600
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,680
He told us that

601
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,080
she is his assistant.

602
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,080
He's my child.

603
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,960
I know him better than anyone.

604
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,280
Even Chuan himself probably isn't aware of

605
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,800
how much he likes her.

606
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,840
Is her name Jiang Xiao Ning?

607
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
Yes, that's the name.

608
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
Right, you guys work in the same company.

609
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,040
Are you close with her?

610
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,840
We're okay.

611
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,680
To be honest,

612
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,280
we don't expect anything from him.

613
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,760
We just want him to be happy.

614
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,320
Now that he has this girl

615
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,360
by his side,

616
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,720
we can stop worrying.

617
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,880
I hope that

618
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
Cheng Ran and you, as friends,

619
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,600
can take good care of them.

620
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
Just pretend that you don't know anything

621
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,000
and let him do his thing.

622
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,080
As for what will happen in the future

623
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,200
and whether they can be together,

624
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,360
it just depends on them.

625
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
Man Lin, is that okay?

626
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Of course.

627
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Aunty, don't worry.

628
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
Thank you so much.

629
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
I'll see you the next time we come back.

630
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,080
Bye, Aunty.

631
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,680
Okay.

632
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,200
Just stay there.

633
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,140
(Cao Peng Peng)

634
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,680
All the dishes are ready!

635
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,840
Someone is already sitting here.

636
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,880
Am I not a person?

637
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,480
Are you?

638
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,720
Why so aggressive?

639
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,800
I know you can beat me up.

640
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,720
But you don't have to

641
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,360
start it this early.

642
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,280
Then why aren't you gone by now?

643
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Who will sit with you if I leave?

644
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,560
Jiang Xiao Ning isn't coming anyway.

645
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,760
So you asked Jiang Xiao Ning

646
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,960
to ask me out.

647
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,040
I had no choice.

648
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,440
This is a public space.

649
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,360
If someone calls the police,

650
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,360
I can't resolve it this time.

651
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,200
What did I tell you yesterday?

652
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,720
Jiang Xiao Ning is my friend.

653
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,840
You cannot harass her.

654
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,560
Are you deaf

655
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,040
or just can't understand it?

656
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,960
I did not harass her.

657
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,040
I just begged her

658
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,880
to ask you out for me.

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,800
It's finished, Boss.

660
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
This,

661
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
this,

662
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,000
this,

663
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
and this

664
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
are still a little rough.

665
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
Give me the ruler.

666
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,160
Since

667
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
you lied to get me to come here,

668
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,280
let's talk

669
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,200
everything out.

670
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,480
What I'm about to say

671
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,360
maybe a little too straightforward.

672
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,440
I have seen

673
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
a lot of people like you.

674
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
They disappear

675
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,240
the day after

676
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,920
we sleep together.

677
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,560
The word responsibility

678
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,720
is nonexistent

679
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,160
in your dictionary.

680
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm serious about you.

681
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,000
What are you serious about?

682
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,920
Do you actually know me?

683
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,200
I can start to get to know you.

684
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,840
No, I mean,

685
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,240
you're experienced.

686
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,720
Why not go find those

687
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,640
that you can pick up easily?

688
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,080
Do I look like I'm easily fooled?

689
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,320
I admit that

690
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,360
I do have some

691
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,440
past experience.

692
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,720
But those were all

693
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,000
just a flash in the pan.

694
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,720
To me,

695
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
guys like you

696
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,280
are a flash in the pan.

697
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
But you're different.

698
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,720
You're the

699
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
most special flash.

700
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
Why do you say that?

701
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,320
Because you are a bastard.

702
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,040
You dared to

703
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,960
harass my best friend Jiang Xiao Ning.

704
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,760
Do others dare?

705
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,360
Don't put our names together.

706
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,280
You are worse than them.

707
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,680
No other girls

708
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,680
have talked to me like this.

709
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,360
Because I

710
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,320
can see through you.

711
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,320
I can't even say that

712
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,920
I know myself.

713
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,720
Why do you say that

714
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,640
you can see through me?

715
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
In my opinion,

716
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,480
the reason that you're rejecting me

717
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,640
this fast

718
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,520
is that you're scared.

719
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't egg me on.

720
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
You're afraid of answering my calls.

721
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,480
You're afraid to see me.

722
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,280
It's because you're afraid that

723
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,200
you'll fall for me.

724
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
You're afraid that you will fall in love with me.

725
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,920
Don't try to over-interpret things.

726
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,880
You

727
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
are not capable of doing that,

728
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,760
at least to me.

729
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,720
Are you willing to try?

730
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,480
Of course,

731
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,800
but not with you.

732
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,560
Tell me where you work

733
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,240
and where you live.

734
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
I'll use all my heart

735
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,320
to move you.

736
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,920
Do you remember the guy

737
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,360
at the hospital?

738
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm not afraid of getting beaten up.

739
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,040
I'm just scared that I won't be able to see you.

740
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,520
Oh my gosh,

741
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,240
I almost got fooled.

742
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm being very genuine.

743
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,200
You don't have to tell me.

744
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,320
I can go ask Jiang Xiao Ning.

745
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,440
How dare you.

746
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
I dare to do anything for you.

747
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
I will warn you one last time.

748
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Jiang Xiao Ning is my friend.

749
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
If you harass her again,

750
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,440
I won't be okay with you.

751
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,680
I won't harass her, I'll harass you.

752
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,720
No, I like you.

753
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,520
Thank you.

754
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,120
I like myself too.

755
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,760
What do you not like about me?

756
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,480
Tell me, I can change.

757
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,560
What do you like about me?

758
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,040
I'll change.

759
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Everything.

760
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,200
Nice.

761
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,880
This meal is on you.

762
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,080
I won't give up on you, Yan Yan.

763
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,920
She's immune to my tactics.

764
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,160
This girl is definitely my type.

765
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,560
Nice.

766
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
Although it's still rough,

767
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,920
it's better than yesterday.

768
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,480
Also, there aren't any errors.

769
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,600
I'll give you a 60 on this,

770
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,600
a passing grade.

771
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,520
Thank you, Boss.

772
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,840
Thank you, Boss.

773
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
What were you going to do?

774
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,600
I...

775
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,360
I was...

776
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,240
What was I going to do?

777
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,520
I wanted to say that

778
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,000
you're right!

779
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,320
As long as you're focused,

780
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
you can do better!

781
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,720
So you're saying that

782
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,880
you weren't focused yesterday.

783
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,400
Right!

784
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,560
No.

785
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,360
I meant,

786
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm a little more focused today.

787
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,280
Phone, Boss.

788
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
Jiang Xiao Ning,

789
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,040
you're dead to me.

790
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
It's late.

791
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
You should go.

792
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,240
Thank you, Boss.

793
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
I'll leave now.

794
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,680
Thank you, teacher.

795
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,480
No.

796
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,520
Boss, thank you for teaching me how to build models.

797
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,240
I'll leave now.

798
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,000
See you tomorrow, Boss.

799
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,480
My dear sister,

800
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,080
I'm sorry,

801
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,840
I won't do that again.

802
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,000
I was just

803
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,920
blinded by profit.

804
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,000
Forgive me, please.

805
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,920
Traitor.

806
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm done with you from now on.

807
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,160
Please don't.

808
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,600
You’re such a great person,

809
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,720
please forgive me.

810
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,920
You can't punish yourself

811
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
for other people's mistakes.

812
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,200
I guess you haven't eaten.

813
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,040
I bought your favorite barbeque

814
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,400
and RIO.

815
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,440
Eat something.

816
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,200
Orange Oolong tea, the newest flavor.

817
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,040
I don't have an appetite when I'm angry.

818
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,080
Don't be.

819
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,440
There's nothing that can't be solved

820
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,600
by drinks and barbeque.

821
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,560
If one doesn't do it, then two.

822
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,840
I meant the drinks.

823
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm telling you.

824
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
If it's not because I'm afraid that

825
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,560
he'll give you a hard time at work,

826
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,480
I would've...

827
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
I know, I know.

828
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,320
Cool down, please.

829
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,560
I know you're doing this for me.

830
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,240
But when Mr. Xu

831
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,880
came to me for help,

832
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,120
he was very sincere and genuine.

833
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,360
I was moved

834
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,280
by his genuineness.

835
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,280
What genuineness?

836
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,200
A person

837
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
who doesn't even know me,

838
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,800
tells me that he likes me.

839
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm telling you, he must be a playboy.

840
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,240
Maybe he just likes your

841
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,200
appearance

842
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,920
and thinks that you're nice,

843
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,720
so he wants to get to know you.

844
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

845
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,120
Xiao Ning, sober up.

846
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,199
Remember,

847
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
if a man

848
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,080
tells you

849
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,400
he likes you

850
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,239
without even getting to know you,

851
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,239
he will like someone else

852
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,760
under the same circumstances,

853
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,400
immediately.

854
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,360
This is the playboy routine.

855
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
I don't think that's always the case.

856
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,400
I think you're too stubborn.

857
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,400
You can't stay inside all the time because

858
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,679
you're afraid of getting hit by a car.

859
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm not afraid of getting hit by a car.

860
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm just refusing a complicated life

861
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,280
with my deep understanding

862
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,120
of what people are truly like.

863
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,040
I can do whatever I want by myself.

864
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,639
That's nice.

865
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,920
Two people are just too troublesome.

866
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,159
I don't think you're celibate.

867
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
You're just afraid of being disappointed

868
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
after getting your hopes up.

869
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,760
Xiao Ning.

870
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,320
You haven't dated anyone.

871
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,719
You don't know

872
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,760
how exhausting it is to be in a relationship.

873
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,560
So I'm warning you,

874
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,239
never fall for someone

875
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,600
so easily

876
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,200
and give him all you have,

877
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,920
like a flying moth darting into the fire.

878
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,720
When times are good,

879
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,080
it's really sweet.

880
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,920
But after that,

881
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,120
it is also the same person

882
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,640
who will cause you all the torture and sadness.

883
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,560
Did you not say that

884
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,360
loving a good person

885
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,320
is worth the pain?

886
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,920
I...

887
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
I was talking about

888
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,520
your boss.

889
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,480
Was I talking about

890
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,360
Xu...

891
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,800
Xu Cheng Ran.

892
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,720
Xu Cheng Ran?

893
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,280
You think I got drunk after one sip?

894
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,120
I want the sliced potato.

895
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,120
Of course.

896
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,720
Please.

897
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,560
Where's your drink?

898
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Here.

899
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,360
Eat more.

900
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,280
I'm telling you,

901
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,200
I almost starved to death today.

902
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,760
I didn't take even one bite

903
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
of any of the dishes on the table.

904
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,880
I made him pay.

905
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,600
Brilliant!

906
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,040
Hey, beauty!

907
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,400
Why are you so late?

908
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,080
I've been so bored. Can't take it any longer.

909
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,680
You've been here for so long,

910
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
but you can't wait just a little longer?

911
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,680
No, I can't.

912
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,720
Does it look nice?

913
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
Yes!

914
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,880
Guess who's here!

915
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,600
Who?

916
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Take a look for yourself.

917
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,840
Xiao Mai.

918
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
Mom!

919
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,400
Why are you here?

920
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,680
You should be resting at home.

921
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,880
Everything is still on there.

922
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,720
Why did you have to come to live here

923
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
when everything is good?

924
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,800
Such a waste of money.

925
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,640
Mom,

926
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,600
am I your daughter or not?

927
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,840
Of course, you are!

928
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,200
You being my daughter

929
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,080
is the reason I treat everyone the same way.

930
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,680
Your brother finally

931
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,000
became an architect.

932
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,640
He just bought a house

933
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,840
and now he has to

934
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
save up for Xiao Ning's university tuition.

935
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,040
Okay, okay, Mom.

936
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,920
Let's go home, alright?

937
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,360
Let's pack up and go home.

938
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,240
Let's go.

939
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,360
We're going home in a car.

940
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Mom, what car?

941
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,360
Aren't you trying to save money?

942
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,840
Let's take the bus.

943
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Aunty,

944
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,680
I borrowed a friend's car.

945
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,440
Aunty.

946
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Thank you, Mister.

947
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,120
Let's get in the car.

948
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:20,880
This way.

949
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,760
Let's go, Grandma.

950
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,960
Let me help you.

951
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,400
Jiang Xiao Ning,

952
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,960
is this the friend you were referring to?

953
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,320
Aunty,

954
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,040
Brother Xu knew you were being discharged today.

955
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,320
He came to pick Grandma and me up

956
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,440
very early in the morning.

957
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Also,

958
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
Both Grandma and you aren't in great shape,

959
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm afraid that I can't take good care of both of you.

960
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,360
Xiao Ning,

961
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,640
it's very fortunate that

962
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,760
Aunty has recovered well.

963
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,680
Let's go.

964
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,760
Aunty.

965
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,120
Let's talk about it when we get home.

966
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,600
Let's go.

967
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,160
Come here.

968
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,120
Thank you, Brother Xu.

969
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,960
Slowly.

970
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Chuan!

971
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Getting this drunk this early in the morning.

972
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
It's dawn already.

973
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm so sad.

974
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,880
Karma.

975
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,080
I've never hurt anyone.

976
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,520
I've only rejected the

977
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,840
the lascivious ones.

978
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,160
Don't use these expressions if you
don't know the meaning.

979
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,120
You've only been rejected.

980
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,160
It's different.

981
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,160
I love Yan Yan.

982
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,520
Let go of me on the count of three.

983
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,120
Three.

984
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,800
After Yan Yan left last night,

985
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,240
I don't feel sleepy at all.

986
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,720
I haven't slept

987
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,360
for 48 hours.

988
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,280
Do you think

989
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,040
I'll become dumb

990
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,600
if I continue like this?

991
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,680
No, no.

992
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,600
You don't need to worry.

993
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,200
You're already dumb enough.

994
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,760
You're right.

995
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm just

996
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,800
an idiot who has fallen in love.

997
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,200
How come

998
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,160
I’m not sleepy at all?

999
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm finally

1000
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,080
enjoying a weekend off.

1001
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,440
Can't you just leave me alone?

1002
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,880
Even you're starting to dislike me.

1003
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,480
Maybe I should start

1004
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,640
doing some self-reflection.

1005
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,320
But,

1006
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,240
I have to bring my phone with me.

1007
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,600
What if Yan Yan contacts me?

1008
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,120
Hey.

1009
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,760
Hey!

1010
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,400
Asleep?

1011
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
Stop.

1012
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,200
Grandma.

1013
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,000
It's okay, I got it.

1014
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,680
Come on.

1015
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,760
We're here!

1016
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,960
My back.

1017
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,560
Here.

1018
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,360
Here.

1019
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:55,960
This way.

1020
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,880
Slowly, Grandma.

1021
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,760
Be careful.

1022
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,920
Jiang Xiao Ning,

1023
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,400
this is not our neighborhood.

1024
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,080
Aunty,

1025
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,240
this is a temporary apartment.

1026
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,040
Something happened

1027
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
while you were in the hospital.

1028
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,640
What happened?

1029
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,120
After we settle down,

1030
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,760
I'll tell you.

1031
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,400
Let's go upstairs first.

1032
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,640
This kid,

1033
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,000
so mysterious.

1034
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,640
Let's go.

1035
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,200
Mom, walk slowly.

1036
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,440
Slowly, Grandma.

1037
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,200
Go get some rest first.

1038
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,880
