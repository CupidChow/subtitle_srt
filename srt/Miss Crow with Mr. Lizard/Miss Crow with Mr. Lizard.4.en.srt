00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Have some water.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,360
Thank you, Brother Xu.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,120
How is aunt?

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,480
She is okay.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,640
But now,

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
I need to check on grandma.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
Brother Xu, thank you for helping me today.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't mention it.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,480
Xiao Ning.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,720
About your new job,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
have you encountered any difficulties?

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,040
I think your boss

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,960
is a bit arrogant and stubborn.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,160
He doesn't look easy to get along with.

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,199
No, he is not.

36
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,039
He always looks like that.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,240
But he is a kind person.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Honestly speaking,

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,200
you rejected my help.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
I feel a bit sad.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Xiao Ning.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,240
He is just an outsider.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,120
Thank you so much for helping me.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
But I don't want to rely on anyone.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Besides,

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
I borrow money from my company.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
And I could still keep the job I like.

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,880
It turned out all right.

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,840
You.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
You're just exactly the same person

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
you were as a child.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
You haven't changed at all.

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,960
Let's go.

54
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,980
(Nurse Station)

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Grandma.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,720
What?

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,040
What's going on?

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,000
Xiao Ning.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
You're here!

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,560
Look at the kitchen!

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
It's ruined!

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Grandma.

63
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
Are you hurt?

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,400
She is okay.

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
I think she got shocked.

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,880
Blame me.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I fell asleep on the sofa.

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
Maybe I was too tired from working overtime
these two days.

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,000
After putting grandma to sleep,

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I didn't hear anything.

71
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,160
Okay. Stop.

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
What's the use of talking so much?

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,560
Pay for the damages.

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
This isn't the first time.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
After paying the damages,

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
move out immediately.

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm not renting out this house.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,920
Wait.

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,600
How much?

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,440
Thirty thousand.

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,320
Not a penny less!

82
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Let me.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
It's due to me.

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,480
Stop it.

85
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,720
Let me solve this.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm not moving.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
The renting term is not due yet.

88
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
We've signed a three-year contract.

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Still a long way to go.

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,560
I will restore the house,

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
back to its original.

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
If you disagree, you can call the police.

93
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,880
The police can reason it out.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,440
You...

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,120
If you

96
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
don't restore to its original condition,

97
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,800
I won't let you get away with it.

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,240
This is just...

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Why did I fall asleep!

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,720
Xiao Ning.

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Let me find a place

102
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,720
for you to stay first.

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,560
Mr. Gu, wait for me.

104
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Wait for me.

105
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,240
Right away.

106
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Right away. Immediately.

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,960
(Today, when I heard)

108
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,960
(you talking about the proposal,)

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
(I was so excited.)

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,640
(I felt that you were shining.)

111
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,680
(Meeting you)

112
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,480
(is the start of my good luck.)

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,920
Mr. Gu, for you.

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Mr. Gu, wish you good health and happiness.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Good health and happiness.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Mr. Gu, goodbye.

117
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,280
Mr. Gu, you're so handsome.

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,400
You're my idol.

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
You're my idol boss.

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
Come, let's check.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,600
Pick it up. Pick it up.

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,680
Drop two glasses of beer?

123
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,360
What's going on with you?

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,760
What's going on with you?

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,640
Mr. Xu, add me on WeChat.

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Okay.

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,040
But my WeChat

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,960
has reached a maximum of 5,000 people.

129
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Let me see who shall I delete.

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
Mr. Xu is so popular.

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,840
Come, cheers.

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,680
You guys enjoy first.

133
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,080
Take over for me.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Come, cheers.

135
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,160
Hello.

136
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,400
Chuan, what are you doing?

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,120
What happened?

138
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,920
It keeps showing that

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,360
your heart rate is abnormal.

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm fine.

141
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,400
I just had a little exercise.

142
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
Exercise?

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm begging you, please.

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,040
Don't make me worry about you.

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Your heart's condition,

146
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
don't you know about it?

147
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,920
How could you do exercise?

148
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,640
Why you always let doctor's words

149
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,880
fall on deaf ears?

150
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
I just wanted to try.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,480
It's good that you're willing to try.

152
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
But you also have to consider

153
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,280
the actual situation.

154
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,720
If anything happens to you,

155
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,520
what about the company?

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,320
What about me?

157
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,280
I've bothered you.

159
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,360
Are you Gu Chuan?

160
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Why are you talking to me like this?

161
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
This is not the Gu Chuan I know.

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay, I'm going to hang up.

163
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Slow down, watch the step.

164
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,120
Brother Xu.

165
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,440
This place stayed the same

166
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
when I was a kid.

167
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
Xiao Ning.

168
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Whose house is this?

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,800
This is my old house.

170
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
You can stay here.

171
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
Xiao Ning.

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Did we turn off the burner in the kitchen?

173
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,720
We've been out for too long.

174
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,520
Let's go home.

175
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,760
Yes, it's off.

176
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's get you into the room and rest.

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,840
Okay?

178
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,480
Come.

179
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll turn off it.

180
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,280
I'll make you delicious food later.

181
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,040
Slow down.

183
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,960
Have some rest.

184
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
This is my study room.

185
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
You can do whatever you want.

186
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,840
Make yourself at home.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
Okay, Brother Xu. Thank you.

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,400
Brother Xu.

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
It's okay.

190
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
I know.

191
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
You don't want to see it.

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
No, I don't want to.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
Last time, when I was here,

194
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,400
I never thought about

195
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,240
that so many things

196
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
would happen to me.

197
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,480
I just feel a bit regretful.

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,160
The better the past was,

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,920
the more trance I'm feeling now.

200
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Are you unhappy

201
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,880
living in that home?

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm all right.

203
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Actually, it's not that bad.

204
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,600
You see, after all,

205
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm in a quite high position now.

206
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,600
Okay.

207
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
Go to bed early.

208
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll come to visit you again another day.

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Sure, thank you.

210
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,960
Harassing phone calls in the early morning.

211
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,680
So persistent.

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
No investment, not purchasing any land.

213
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,240
No interviews with journalists.

214
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Support gender equality.

215
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
Not supporting 996 working hour system.

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Any more questions?

217
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,840
Cheng Ran.

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm assistant Liu.

219
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Assistant Liu.

220
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
I thought it's telemarketing.

221
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,800
What happened?

222
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,960
Director Xu is hospitalized.

223
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't you worry.

224
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,200
I've spoken to the neighbor.

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,200
They'll help to look after grandma.

226
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,880
As for you, just rest well.

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,160
Don't think of anything at all.

228
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Early in the morning,

229
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
you've done so many things.

230
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
How early do you have to get up?

231
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
Last night,

232
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,520
so many things happened too.

233
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,520
It's okay, just don't worry about it.

234
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,960
My company has paid the medical expenses for you.

235
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll pay them back slowly.

236
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't be too frugal on yourself.

237
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,840
I have enough money.

238
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,160
Once I get better,

239
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,360
I must personally

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
thank your boss.

241
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
You've had so many jobs before.

242
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,960
None of the bosses treated you well.

243
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
You've met a kind boss.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Our boss

245
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,880
not only is kind-hearted and handsome

246
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,720
but also very talented.

247
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,320
How old is he?

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,280
Does he have a girlfriend?

249
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Aunt, what are you thinking?

250
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
Wake up.

251
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,960
It's not like those TV shows that

252
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
grandma watched.

253
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,840
He paid for your medical expenses.

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
Don't be a scourge to him.

255
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,000
I was just asking.

256
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
Why are you so nervous?

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
You better stop having such thinking.

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Look at him and what he's got.

259
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
What do I have?

260
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes, correct.

261
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,160
You?

262
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
Except for your poor educational background,

263
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
your height,

264
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
and your financial situation,

265
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
you have no other shortcomings.

266
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Early in the morning,

267
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
you did comfort me well.

268
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
Okay, I'm leaving.

269
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm going to pick up my boss.

270
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,920
I've spoken to the nurse.

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,680
For lunch,

272
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll help you to order a takeaway.

273
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
The nurse will bring it for you.

274
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
You just leave like this?

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,480
Sorry to trouble you.

276
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:41,800
No worries.

277
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,160
Goodbye.

278
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Careful on your way.

279
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Okay.

280
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,520
Hi.

281
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,640
Please take good care

282
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,320
of my aunt.

283
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,040
Thank you.

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,000
No worries.

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,680
Goodbye.

286
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
Your niece is so filial.

287
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
She bought us breakfast

288
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,160
even it's early in the morning.

289
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,520
She said she got work to do

290
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,240
and she has no time to take care of you.

291
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
She asked us to help and take care of you.

292
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
What a thoughtful girl.

293
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,760
This child.

294
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,040
She is too thoughtful.

295
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,640
Okay.

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Remember to take the medicine
after finishing your meal.

297
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay. Thank you.

298
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,080
Brother.

299
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,360
Xiao Ning has grown up as a good girl.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,280
It would be nice if you were here.

301
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Sleeping?

302
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,160
After eating this tangerine,

303
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,040
I'll be going back.

304
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
You finally came.

305
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,280
You haven't been home for a long time.

306
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
You just spent all your time

307
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,560
on that lousy company.

308
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,320
What good would that do?

309
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Why should I go home?

310
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
To watch you and your godson

311
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,640
bonding?

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,280
Or to watch you

313
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,040
flirt with another woman?

314
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
The reasons I don't go home.

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,400
You know it clearly.

316
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,880
Cheng Ran.

317
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Listen to your father, come back.

318
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,920
Not only that you'll succeed in your career.

319
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,720
In the company,

320
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,560
you can win everyone's heart.

321
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Look at me now.

322
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
What if one day I'm gone

323
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,160
and leave the company in such a situation?

324
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
Have you ever thought about it?

325
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,200
What should I do?

326
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
Who shall I hand it over to?

327
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,800
Don't you

328
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
still have another son?

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
He works at your place,

330
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,080
doing well.

331
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
Why do you count on me?

332
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm not interested in fighting over ownership
of family property.

333
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm fine with the money I have right now.

334
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,680
Xu Cheng Ran.

335
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Your tantrums.

336
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
When can you tame it?

337
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,260
(Unit 106)

338
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
Why are you here?

339
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,280
Mr. Gu.

340
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,040
I'll drive you and pick you up for work.

341
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,840
Aren't your aunt still in the hospital?

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,480
I've sorted all things out for my aunt.

343
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,360
Let's go.

344
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,360
Mr. Gu.

345
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
I've bought you some fruits.

346
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,960
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

347
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,120
It doesn't matter.

348
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,320
You don't have to thank me.

349
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,640
To me, it matters.

350
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,160
You lent me money.

351
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
It proves that I can continue

352
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,560
to work in the company.

353
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
I can also keep learning from you.

354
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,960
Why didn't you finish university?

355
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,440
Because my grandma is getting old.

356
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,160
She is with Alzheimer's.

357
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
She needs someone to take care of her.

358
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,320
My aunt's health condition is not good either.

359
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
I quit study to work.

360
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,720
Fortunately, everything

361
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,480
is getting better now.

362
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Things will get better.

363
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Mr. Gu.

364
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,960
Can you smile more?

365
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,480
Don't always put on a straight face.

366
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Or, you'll be a boss always with a straight face.

367
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
Do you have a problem with me?

368
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,680
No, no.

369
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,440
Although

370
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
I only get to know you just for a short time,

371
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,800
I know that

372
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,160
you're a kind person.

373
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,680
My aunt said so too.

374
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,720
She also asked me how old are you?

375
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Do you have a girlfriend?

376
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,240
She also said that

377
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,400
to thank you for lending me the money,

378
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,880
she wants to introduce a girl to you.

379
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,720
She knows everyone

380
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,640
in our community.

381
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
What kind of girl do you like?

382
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,120
She can find you one.

383
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
Please thank her for me.

384
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,560
Look, you finally laughed.

385
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,760
Just drive.

386
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,280
Yes.

387
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,720
Director Xu.

388
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,920
Brother, you came.

389
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,480
Who is your brother?

390
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
My last name is Xu, your last name is Tang.

391
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,720
We're not related.

392
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
I just asked the doctor.

393
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
The doctor said you need to
stay for another few days.

394
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,240
Then, you can leave.

395
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
After discharging from the hospital,

396
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,240
you'll need to be on a light diet.

397
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
You're not allowed to drink for the time being.

398
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,880
Okay.

399
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm leaving.

400
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm just an outsider.

401
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,760
I don't want to bother the bonding

402
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
between the father and his son.

403
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,360
Deputy Director Xu.

404
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,160
Regarding your employees,

405
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Jiang Guang Da and Tang Zheng Cheng

406
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,720
for misuse of public funds,

407
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
committing the occupational crime,

408
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,240
can you reveal some details?

409
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,560
As the deputy director of the company,

410
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,680
are you completely unaware of this?

411
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,839
This kind of thing happened

412
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,599
under your nose.

413
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Would you

414
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,079
tender your resignation?

415
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,760
I heard that Jiang Guang Da had a car accident

416
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,560
while trying to abscond.

417
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,240
Is this true?

418
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,460
(Xu Cheng Ran, 19 years old)

419
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
This is my home.

420
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,319
Dad.

421
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,560
Goodbye, teacher.

422
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,720
Goodbye, teacher.

423
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Let me introduce him to you.

424
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
This is my son, Xu Cheng Ran.

425
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
This is Tang Xu.

426
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
(Tang Xu, 17 years old)
Something happened to his family.

427
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,800
(Tang Xu, 17 years old)
For the time being,

428
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,840
he'll stay at our place for a while.

429
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,440
You two.

430
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,040
You're elder brother.

431
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
You'll call him Brother Ran Ran from now on.

432
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,680
(Tang Xu, 18 years old) (Xu Cheng Ran, 20 years old)
Worth celebrating!

433
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,800
(Tang Xu, 18 years old) (Xu Cheng Ran, 20 years old)

434
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,880
Just turned eighteen years old.

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,040
Started your own business as soon as
you go to the university.

436
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,160
Most importantly, it's profitable.

437
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Come. It's worth celebrating.

438
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,600
Come, let's have a toast.

439
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,120
Jia Jia.

440
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Why are you munching every day?

441
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
Eating snacks makes me feel good.

442
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
All packages are sent?

443
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Yes, Xian Ning helped me send it.

444
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
You can't just

445
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,400
leave everything to Xiao Ning.

446
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,480
I tell you,

447
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,320
Xiao Ning's biggest mistake

448
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,000
is to have met you.

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't.

450
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,120
I like Xiao Ning so much.

451
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,520
Does she like you?

452
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,880
Yes, she does.

453
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,840
I like every colleague

454
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,720
in the company.

455
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,320
See.

456
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,040
That's because Xiao Ning is a thoughtful girl.

457
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,840
Brother Dong.

458
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,600
Brother Dong.

459
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
Can I borrow your design

460
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,600
and have a look?

461
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Can you understand it?

462
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,520
Of course.

463
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
I studied design at university.

464
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,920
Oh sure.

465
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,640
Thank you.

466
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,400
Sister Man Lin.

467
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,280
You were at the construction site, right?

468
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,120
It must be a hard day.

469
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,840
Let me get a glass of water for you.

470
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay, thank you.

471
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
-Oh right.
-Jiang Xiao Ning.

472
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,400
Come over here.

473
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,720
Tell him you won't.

474
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
You'll be very busy with Mr. Gu's matter

475
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,560
this afternoon.

476
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,600
Brother Kai.

477
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,640
Can you wait for some time?

478
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,480
I'll come over later.

479
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,240
Jiang Xiao Ning.

480
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,040
Becoming so daring now?

481
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,320
Who is in charge of you?

482
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,800
It's not you anyway.

483
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,640
This is a design company.

484
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,720
The designer has a say in everything.

485
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,520
Understand?

486
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't understand.

487
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,480
Do I have to

488
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,080
kneel down and bow to you?

489
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
Then please kneel down and bow now.

490
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Based on the performance in the company,

491
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,840
even if you kneel down and bow,
it won't be good enough.

492
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,480
Then I'll burn some joss paper for you.

493
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,040
What do you say?

494
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,960
Look, guys.

495
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,720
Sister Man Lin, Brother Kai.

496
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
If there is anything, just tell me.

497
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,840
That's it.

498
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
I'll work overtime today.

499
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,520
I'll be off after completing everything.

500
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,440
The weather is hot.

501
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,840
Let's not argue and destroy the harmony.

502
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
If you have anything, just tell me.

503
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
Don't be angry, okay?

504
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Don't argue.

505
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,120
Sister Man Lin.

506
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
This is for you.

507
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,040
These are all the similar

508
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
architectural styles that I could get.

509
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
The content is a bit overloaded.

510
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
It might take a while to load.

511
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,120
When you open it,

512
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,880
it might take some time.

513
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,800
Okay. Thank you.

514
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
What's the matter? Is there anything else?

515
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,520
Thank you for helping me last night.

516
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,320
This gift is for you.

517
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,720
It may not that expensive.

518
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,360
But it's a token of my gratitude.

519
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
I chose it specifically to express gratitude.
And it suits you.

520
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
It matches you.

521
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,760
No need, it was Mr. Gu who helped you.

522
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,240
I can't accept it.

523
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,720
Please just accept it.

524
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,680
You don't know

525
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,720
how moved I was.

526
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Since I've bought it.

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,520
Okay then, thank you.

528
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,560
Oh yes.

529
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,680
Regarding that resort project,

530
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,720
is there anything else

531
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,640
I can help?

532
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,840
No, no need. Mr. Gu is in charge of it.

533
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,120
It seems like we failed.

534
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
Failed.

535
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,840
Is it because of me?

536
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,800
There're many reasons that a project failed.

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
It's impossible due to

538
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,120
you alone.

539
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,880
You don't have to carry any emotional burden.

540
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,840
Go and do your job.

541
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,280
Thank you.

542
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,760
Mr. Gu.

543
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,440
This document requires your signature.

544
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

545
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,880
That resort project...

546
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
You're not a designer.

547
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why are you saying sorry?

548
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,760
Do you have any idea

549
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,960
regarding the resort project?

550
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,920
I...

551
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,520
What idea could I have?

552
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,120
At that moment, I was so shocked

553
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,000
by this thought.

554
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,840
Just say whatever you want.

555
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,840
I won't deduct your salary.

556
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm going to say now.

557
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,040
I think that this project

558
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,320
is very good.

559
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,600
However,

560
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
it's just that Chinese people and

561
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
people from other countries

562
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,200
have different aesthetics.

563
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,160
The containers are placed there.

564
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,000
Indeed,

565
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
it's very avant-garde.

566
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,160
It can be an iconic building.

567
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,960
However, I guess

568
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,000
people of my aunt's age

569
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,640
wouldn't admire it.

570
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,760
They might find it boring.

571
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
So,

572
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
shall we color every container

573
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
differently?

574
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
I thought the same too.

575
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,320
Look.

576
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,800
I was teaching one's grandmother to suck eggs.

577
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,880
I'll go out now.

578
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

579
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,040
I fell asleep.

580
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,160
Have you finished?

581
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,200
I'll get you home now.

582
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,760
You've done a lot of things today.

583
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm productive.

584
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,040
It's time to get off work. Let's go.

585
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Have you tried fishing before?

586
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Yes.

587
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,600
Let's go.

588
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,040
Mr. Gu.

589
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,000
It's so dark now.

590
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
We can't see anything in the water.

591
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,320
We can't see anything,

592
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,240
but we can feel.

593
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,360
When I was young,

594
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,160
my father used to take me fishing.

595
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,120
I was under the sun for a few hours

596
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,600
and my skin was peeling.

597
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,880
When I got home, my mother

598
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,560
scolded me for two hours.

599
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
She said I was ugly already.

600
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,520
With the sunburn, I was tanned and ugly.

601
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
I kept wondering

602
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,520
what's so fun about fishing?

603
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
With money, we can buy fish.

604
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
Could it be

605
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
because the wild ones taste better?

606
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Mr. Gu.

607
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,640
Have you ever thought that

608
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
Jiang Zi Ya's fishing

609
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,360
could be a performance art

610
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,440
in modern days?

611
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,600
If this is on the Internet,

612
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
it will be regarded as a publicity stunt for sure.

613
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Can you stop talking?

614
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
You scared fish away.

615
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,800
But, there are only two of us

616
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,280
at this place.

617
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
If I stop talking,

618
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,840
it will be very desolate.

619
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,960
Creating and designing are lonely.

620
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
If you want to

621
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,720
be a designer,

622
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,720
you must learn to think silently.

623
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,120
Have I

624
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
disturbed your train of thought?

625
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,480
What do you think?

626
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,040
Fish!

627
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,320
A fish!

628
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,080
(Gu,)

629
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,920

630
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,200

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,320
Your aunt is sick, right?

648
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,080
Take this and make some soup

649
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,040
to help her recover.

650
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,400
This is your overtime pay.

651
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,360
This fish is for my overtime pay?

652
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,880
No, no way.

653
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
Mr. Gu, if the fishbone

654
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,000
gets stuck at the throat, it will be uncomfortable.

655
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,560
We never eat fish.

656
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,440
As for the overtime pay,

657
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,080
I prefer money.

658
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,560
There's no fish

659
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,720
on my menu tomorrow.

660
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
Why is my life

661
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,240
filled with suffering?

662
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Since you worked overtime today,

663
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,280
you don't have to pick me up tomorrow.

664
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,800
Yes, Mr. Gu!

665
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
Thanks for your hard work.

666
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,080
You're back.

667
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
You haven't had your dinner yet, have you?

668
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,960
It's already there.

669
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,960
I was waiting for you.

670
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,400
Self-heating hot pot?

671
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,840
Get some rest first.

672
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,920
Eat something.

673
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,840
Come.

674
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,800
What do you say?

675
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,280
Some initial positive effects.

676
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,600
Be careful, it's hot.

677
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Thank you.

678
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,560
What is that?

679
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,400
Like I told you in WeChat,

680
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,000
Mr. Gu asked me to go fishing with him.

681
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,040
So that's the bucket.

682
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
Your boss is great.

683
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,920
He has a work-life balance.

684
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,640
He's a nice person,

685
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
but he looks a bit weird.

686
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,000
Weird?

687
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,840
Tell me more.

688
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,440
I'll help you take him down.

689
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,960
Why are you like my aunt?

690
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
We are not

691
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,080
having that kind of relationship.

692
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Haven't I been

693
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,600
just like your aunt?

694
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Taking him down means

695
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
not allowing him to bully you

696
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,440
at work.

697
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
What were you thinking?

698
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,560
Do you like him?

699
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,040
Yan Yan.

700
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
Are you jealous?

701
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,440
Are you afraid that I would ditch you

702
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,400
if I'm into a guy?

703
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,120
You better be.

704
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
I'm afraid you'd stick to me and disturb me

705
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,880
when I'm flirting with guys.

706
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,320
Annoying.

707
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,240
Hello?

708
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,520
Chuan.

709
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,240
Don't go to the office tomorrow.

710
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Just work at home.

711
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,600
The weather forecast stated that
it will rain tomorrow.

712
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
I've got a lot to do at the studio,

713
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,080
I must be there tomorrow.

714
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
The loss of you being absent for a day

715
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
is way lesser than the loss of

716
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,160
you malfunctioning the elevators.

717
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Do you want to make everyone

718
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,200
in the building

719
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,880
climb the stairs again?

720
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
Uncle and aunt have exhorted me

721
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,240
that your condition will be worse

722
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,120
when there is rain and storm

723
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,320
due to the electric current in the air.

724
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay, listen to me. Don't go to the office.

725
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,920
I'll still be around.

726
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,880
As long as I'm around...

727
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
You are my biggest worry.

728
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
If I'm not around for a day,

729
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,480
you'll bring the bar to the office.

730
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,480
You've misunderstood me.

731
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,360
After all, I invested in this company too.

732
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,320
Why don't

733
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,800
we be absent together?

734
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,840
Go out and find something fun that you can do.

735
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,720
What else can you do now?

736
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
You can't flirt with girls,

737
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
can't drink, and can't race cars.

738
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,320
Let's go to an amusement park.

739
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,640
Let's ride the merry-go-round

740
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,160
and Ferris wheel.

741
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,160
How romantic.

742
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,440
All right, enough.

743
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm going to hang up.

744
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
If I don't see you

745
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,560
in the office tomorrow,

746
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,720
I will tell Qi Hong

747
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,200
to deduct all your salary

748
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,160
for this month.

749
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,400
Oh right.

750
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,480
Nobody is coming to pick me up tomorrow.

751
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,520
You should come and pick me up.

752
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,720
Hello?

753
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm the boss, aren't I?

754
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
Does a boss get a salary deduction as well?

755
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,960
What's the point of

756
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,960
being a boss then?

757
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,320
My call even got hung up by

758
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,520
a person without conscience.

759
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,840
You won't even hang up the cleaner's call.

760
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
How dare you hang up my call.

761
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
I neither have love

762
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,440
nor happiness.

763
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,800
What is this life that I'm having?

764
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,120
Ugh.

765
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm starving to death.

766
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
With people like your boss,

767
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,440
you must always have one thing in mind.

768
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,440
What is it?

769
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,480
That is,

770
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
be yourself.

771
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,880
Think about it.

772
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,800
As the boss of such a big company,

773
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,640
hasn't he met many different employees?

774
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,480
Why did he choose you?

775
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,360
Is it because you're capable?

776
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,360
We have a common answer for this, right?

777
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
You're quite smart,

778
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,960
but you're still a rookie

779
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,960
in this field.

780
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,240
So there must be some highlights in you

781
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,680
that attracted him and

782
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
made him choose you.

783
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,600
All you have to do is

784
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,040
to learn more and be less confused.

785
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,880
Just be yourself.

786
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
Perfect.

787
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
I just don't get it.

788
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
Why do I feel that

789
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,080
I'm a person without any strength?

790
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
You don't have to

791
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,720
belittle yourself.

792
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,520
Do you know what's your

793
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,440
greatest strength to me?

794
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
You're very sincere,

795
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,680
unlike those

796
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,440
hypocritical girls.

797
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,360
They are so annoying. So hypocritical.

798
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,120
In addition, you're

799
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,840
quite unlucky,

800
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,000
but

801
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
you have a positive mind.

802
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
Whenever you encounter a problem,

803
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,400
you always take it positively.

804
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,280
If I were you,

805
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,400
I would be so mad

806
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,720
and I would resign.

807
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,800
When my parents were still around,

808
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,320
they gave me sufficient love.

809
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,400
My grandma and aunt did too.

810
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,240
Whenever I think about the fact that

811
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
there are still people who love me,

812
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,400
I won't feel

813
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,520
that unbearable anymore.

814
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,160
You have love in you.

815
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,640
You're nice to everyone.

816
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,240
This is something good.

817
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
However, there are people

818
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,560
who will make use of you and bully you

819
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,880
because they know you will do it.

820
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,400
I don't have anything.

821
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,440
What can they get from me?

822
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,240
I'm not...

823
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,120
Alright, enough.

824
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,680
Hurry up and eat.

825
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,640
We still got walls to paint.

826
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,920
I can also enjoy

827
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
the feeling of instructing people.

828
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,640
Yes, ma'am!

829
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Give me a bite.

830
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,200
Be careful, it's hot.

831
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,480
Is it tasty?

832
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,640
Yes.

833
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
It's too hot.

834
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
You've been hanging up my calls.

835
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
That girl...

836
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Why didn't Jiang Xiao Ning pick you up?

837
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,880
She's neglecting her duty.

838
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Why did she

839
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,120
stop sending you to work suddenly?

840
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,200
Did you scold her?

841
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Don't blame me.

842
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,360
Don't blame her either.

843
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
I told her not to come.

844
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,280
You're being protective.

845
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,720
Did something happen?

846
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,240
Nothing.

847
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,760
She worked overnight last night.

848
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,720
You shouldn't

849
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,440
keep a straight face all the time.

850
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
You're scaring people away.

851
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,560
It will be nice if you smile more.

852
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,200
Why does everyone say that?

853
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
Who else said that?

854
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,080
Jiang Xiao Ning said that too.

855
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,960
Did she?

856
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
This Jiang Xiao Ning is making me surprised.

857
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,080
Why?

858
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,920
I have a feeling that

859
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,440
you won't fire her.

860
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Why?

861
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,440
It's my instinct.

862
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,640
She's probably

863
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,160
the one that I've been looking for.

864
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Tell you what.

865
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,560
Don't you ever

866
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,840
do anything bad to my employees.

867
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
I didn't mean that.

868
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
You're so annoying.

869
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,719
You're affecting my happy driving mood.

870
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Thanks, Brother Xu.

871
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,360
I'll go to work then.

872
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,840
Okay.

873
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,840
Good morning, Mr. Xu and Mr. Gu!

874
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:37,679
Godson?

875
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
I don't think it's appropriate for you
to call me that.

876
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,960
My father's godson.

877
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,880
Is that okay?

878
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,920
He's the godson

879
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,960
that I told you.

880
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
Why are you here at our office?

881
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,120
What are you here for?

882
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,040
Good morning, Mr. Xu.

883
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,679
Is the world so small?

884
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,600
You're fighting with me

885
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,880
over my father and the company.

886
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,560
In the future, you might be

887
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,280
fighting for the property with me.

888
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
Now, you even send a spy

889
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,480
to our company.

890
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,680
I can't ignore this anymore.

891
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,720
You can say anything.

892
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm not a spy.

893
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,000
I passed an official interview.

894
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,160
I'm also here to drive Xiao Ning to work.

895
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,640
Driving my employees to work

896
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,320
is not allowed either.

897
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,320
It affects her work.

898
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,520
Did you hear him?

899
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Do not drive her to work anymore.

900
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,760
Brother, do you have to do that?

901
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,200
Don't call me brother, I can't take it.

902
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,360
Dear bosses,

903
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,480
it's quite late now.

904
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,320
Let's go to work.

905
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Our salary will be deducted if we are late.

906
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,160
Out of the four people here, you're the only one

907
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,840
who might get a salary deduction.

908
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
I'll leave then.

909
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,920
Brother Xu, I'll leave now.

910
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,360
Xiao Ning.

911
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,560
Call me when you get off work.

912
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,440
Okay.

913
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,520
Jiang Xiao Ning.

914
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Are you still on probation now?

915
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,240
Yes.

916
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,360
The company's rule stated that

917
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,920
one must not be in a relationship
during probation.

918
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,000
Otherwise, he or she will be fired.

919
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,640
I've never heard of this rule.

920
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,480
There is one now.

921
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,640
Mr. Xu, do you agree?

922
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,280
Totally.

923
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Good.

924
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,040
The Board of Directors has approved.

925
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,360
I understand.

926
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,760
One must not be in a relationship
during probation.

927
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,560
Do not be in contact frequently

928
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,080
with irrelevant personnel.

929
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,080
Who is considered irrelevant personnel?

930
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,840
One who is not our employee.

931
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,920
A male.

932
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,480
Single.

933
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,160
Similar age.

934
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,120
Tall.

935
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,000
Who has his hair styled.

936
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,880
Who wears a wind coat.

937
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,520
Whose surname is Tang.

938
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,320
That's gone too far.

939
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,920
You're right. That's specific enough.

940
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,800
That's about it.

941
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,920
Brother Xu,

942
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,640
please leave now.

943
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,080
Brother.

944
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,600
No matter how you see me,

945
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,840
we are brothers after all.

946
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Today, I would like to

947
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,600
ask a favor from you.

948
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
Please let Jiang Xiao Ning leave.

949
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't want to see her

950
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,760
suffering every day.

951
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,200
I'm begging you.

952
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,720
I want her to be in a better place.

953
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
This is also my first time begging you

954
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,680
in ten years.

955
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,920
Brother Xu.

956
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,920
He's right.

957
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,080
It's really his first time begging me.

958
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,240
However,

959
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,000
why should I agree?

960
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,240
Chuan.

961
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
Someone is poaching your employee in front of you.

962
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't you want to say something?

963
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

964
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Do you want to leave?

965
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,040
No.

966
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,240
Did you hear her?

967
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,040
She doesn't want to.

968
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,000
Dear bosses,

969
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
since I've chosen this job,

970
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,680
I won't be distracted.

971
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,480
I like my current boss very much

972
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,760
and my current company as well.

973
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,960
I will work hard.

974
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,120
Why do you flatter

975
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,160
Gu Chuan so much?

976
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,120
But I like it very much.

977
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
The world used to have no roads,

978
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
just because of

979
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,640
legs like you,

980
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,680
there is a road for Chuan now.

981
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,240
Work hard.

982
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,880
I'll give you a raise.

983
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,560
Thank you, Mr. Xu!

984
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
Brother Xu, please leave now.

985
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
Come on. Go!

986
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Be careful.

987
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,480
Boss.

988
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,080
See you later.

989
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,800
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

990
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,200
What an unalloyed success.

991
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,120
What?

992
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,240
Just do it.

993
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,360
Call me when you get off work.

994
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,360
Boss.

995
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,760
It's lunchtime now.

996
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,240
Have some soup first.

997
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,480
Here you go.

998
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,200
This is the fish that you caught.

999
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,880
I woke up early today to stew it.

1000
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Not only does it contain

1001
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,040
your own hard work,

1002
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,960
but also your subordinate's

1003
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,800
love and respect.

1004
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,800
Give it a try.

1005
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,680
(Boss,)

1006
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,960
(since you've had the fish soup,)

1007
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,440
(you can't substitute it with the overtime pay.)

1008
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,000
How is it?

1009
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,880
Not bad.

1010
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll go out first.

1011
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,520
Boss.

1012
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,840
Mr. Gu.

1013
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,680
Can you please smile more?

1014
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,240
Don't keep a straight face all the time.

1015
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,320
Or you'll be a boss always with a straight face.

1016
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,240
Let's go.

1017
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,560
Drive to Mr. Qin's office.

1018
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,640
Mr. Gu.

1019
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
Is it about the resort's project?

1020
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
Do you need me to come along?

1021
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,480
No, just do your own stuff.

1022
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,480
Mr. Gu.

1023
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,400
You're here.

1024
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:25,960
Mr. Qin.

1025
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,880
I've told you

1026
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,840
what happened

1027
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,520
over the phone.

1028
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,160
I've seen the complementary proposal.

1029
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,800
It's quite good.

1030
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,080
Take a seat.

1031
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,160
To be honest, my assistant played

1032
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,400
a big role

1033
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,080
in this proposal.

1034
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,160
We did think about

1035
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,040
the issue of the target audience

1036
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,120
that you mentioned.

1037
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,600
So, we think that when we increase

1038
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,920
more different containers,

1039
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
we can also

1040
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
paint different fields of flowers on them,

1041
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,480
which will be a stark contrast.

1042
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,640
This will eliminate

1043
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,480
your previous worry.

1044
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,920
Good.

1045
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,800
Mr. Qin.

1046
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,720
I don't want to hide anything from you.

1047
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,560
It's true that

1048
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
my assistant started working not long ago.

1049
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,840
But my studio

1050
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,440
wouldn't accept

1051
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,800
irresponsible people.

1052
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,040
I think that professionalism can be trained,

1053
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
but nothing can be done

1054
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,200
if one is irresponsible.

1055
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,200
This is also the reason

1056
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,520
why I asked you to come today.

1057
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,280
The previous price that you offered

1058
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,880
was much higher than the market price.

1059
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
I was thinking even if you're Gu Chuan,

1060
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,960
it wouldn't make me

1061
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,680
pay for it decisively.

1062
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,400
After that, I made an investigation.

1063
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,920
The person who marked up the price

1064
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,040
in between has been got rid of.

1065
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
This is how sincere

1066
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,400
I am towards this cooperation.

1067
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,440
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

1068
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,640
You were willing to be honest

1069
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,880
and you even brought the draft here.

1070
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,240
It shows that you're being sincere too.

1071
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
I hope we can have good cooperation.

1072
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,960
Sure.
