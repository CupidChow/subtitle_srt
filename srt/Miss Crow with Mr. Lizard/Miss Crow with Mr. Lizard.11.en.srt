21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Hello, Boss.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Am I that picky?

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,760
Boss, you are not picky, I am.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,480
As you assistant,

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
I have to make sure you like me.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
I like you already.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
I like what you pick.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,440
That's great.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,480
Do you have instructions for me?

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Since you're so good at picking stuff out,

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
come pick me up tomorrow morning.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,440
Help me pick out some outfits.

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,360
Isn't everyone meeting up at the office first

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,360
to take the bus together tomorrow morning?

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
We can drive ourselves there.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
Why do you suddenly need to buy clothes?

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,600
What do you need them for?

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,600
To be honest,

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
I don't have much experience

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,320
when it comes to shopping for clothes.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Everything I own

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,800
looks pretty much the same.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Are you expecting me to wear suits

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,360
during our team-building event?

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,120
Oh, that's true.

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Alright then.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
See you tomorrow morning.

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay. Go to bed early.

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
We have a long drive ahead tomorrow.

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,120
Good night.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
Hurry up and get in the car!

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,240
Get in.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
Jia Jia, remember to save me a seat.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,560
Let's go.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Hurry.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,000
Hurry up.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
Be proactive

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,760
in the team-building event.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Do we have everyone?

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,280
If we do, let's get this show on the road.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Mr. Gu isn't here yet.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,760
Mr. Gu said he's got something to do first.

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,360
Xiao Ning

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
will drive him there.

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,280
Did he say what it was?

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,400
I...

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,600
Do I dare to ask about our boss's personal business?

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
If you want to know,

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,600
call Xiao Ning

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
and find out.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Let's go.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Are you coming?

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
If not, we're leaving without you.

74
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,560
Good morning, Boss.

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,520
Morning.

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Did you sleep well?

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,240
Very well.

78
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,920
Don't worry, Boss.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,240
Long-distance driving won't be a problem.

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:51,960
Good.

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Then let's go shopping first.

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,200
You mean it?

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Of course.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
Then, what kind of clothes would you like to buy?

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,160
You can decide.

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Boss, you don't have any luggage?

87
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,600
I already

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
put everything in the trunk last night.

89
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Great.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Boss.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,240
You think these are good?

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,160
Alright,

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
I'll go try them on.

94
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
Miss.

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,880
This one

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,880
is a matching outfit

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,880
to your boyfriend's.

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
Would you like to try these on?

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,760
No.

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not a good idea.

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
Try them on.

102
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
How would you know without trying them on?

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
Looks pretty good.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,240
But this necklace...

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,280
Xu...

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,880
My friend bought it

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
for me from a business trip.

108
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
It doesn't go with this outfit.

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Really?

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,280
You're right.

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
I'll take it off then.

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,840
Now everything looks much better.

113
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,200
Okay,

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
we'll take both.

115
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Very well, Sir. This way please.

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,160
Okay.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,520

Hurry.

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Here, come on.

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Give... give it to me.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Make sure you take care of it.

135
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Go inside.

136
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
It's so pretty! Come on.

137
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
Here. Be careful.

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,880
It's even prettier over there.

139
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,240
Watch your step.

140
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
It's so pretty here.

141
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
So nice.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Let's go check it out.

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,960
Look over there. And that.

144
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
What's... what's that called?

145
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,600
Let me take your picture.

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,200
Everyone, listen up.

147
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
This is

148
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
the Lu Sen Bubble Houses

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,760
we'll be staying at.

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Choose whichever one you want.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Go get some rest first.

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,640
Leave the most spacious one for Mr. Gu.

153
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,120
We'll be having a barbeque party tonight!

154
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Wang Kai.

155
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,440
I want the one

156
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,120
closest to Mr. Gu.

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,880
I already said you can choose
whichever you want.

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,160
I have to report

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
to Mr. Gu about work whenever needed.

160
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Can't you let Mr. Gu

161
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
relax for a few days?

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Mr. Gu has been so wound up.

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
He finally agreed to

164
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,920
come out with us this one time,

165
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
yet you still want him to work?

166
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
Su Man Lin,

167
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
how ruthless you are.

168
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Jia Jia.

169
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,080
Come here.

170
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll be your next-door neighbor.

171
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,280
I've done all the possible research.

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,919
Food, entertainment, you name it.

173
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm super prepared.

174
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,880
Sure.

175
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,159
I'm okay with whatever.

176
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,240
There is a large temperature difference
between day and night.

177
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,720
Kai Kai Wang's heart-warming package,

178
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,880
only for Qiao Meng Jia.

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,320
Wow, 666!
(*A cold medicine)

180
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
You're so thoughtful.

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
I have a question.

182
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Why didn't

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
Mr. Xu come with us?

184
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,800
Mr. Xu has gone MIA recently.

185
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
It doesn't matter whether he comes or not.

186
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,960
Don't you think I'm really sweet

187
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
and really thoughtful?

188
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
You're right, thanks.

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
Sister Hong,

190
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,600
I have 666.

191
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Do you want some?

192
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,040
Dong, Dong.

193
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,720
Come take some photos for me.

194
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
Sure thing.

195
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,120
Make sure to get

196
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
the bubble house in the frame. Hurry.

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,360
I… He… I don't...

198
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Come here.

199
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
I'll charge you.

200
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,560
Cheese!

201
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Let's go.

202
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,480
Over there and over here.

203
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Time to fight for the rooms.

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Jia Jia.

205
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
No need to fight,

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
we're sharing one anyway.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,760
Sharing?

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Sh... sharing? I thought we are just neighbors?

209
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,320
This is it.

210
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,800
This one?

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480
Jia Jia, this is the one.

212
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
This is it?

213
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,960
Keep going you guys.

214
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,440
Bye.

215
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,360
Check out the ones in front.

216
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,780
(Café YELLOW)

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,980
(Xu Cheng Ran)

218
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,800
(Yan Yan,)

219
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
(are you off work?)

220
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,020
(Xu Cheng Ran)

221
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,680
This has been checked.

222
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay.

223
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,980
(Xu Cheng Ran)

224
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,620
(Xu Cheng Ran)

225
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,420
(Slide to power off)

226
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
Zhao Yan, what are you doing?

227
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
I want to work overtime.

228
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,040
Let's go have dinner together?

229
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,360
No, I'm fine.

230
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,280
I can finish this today.

231
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
This isn't urgent.

232
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,880
You can submit it later.

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
Come on, Zhao Yan.

234
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
Even Manager Wei is giving us the green light.

235
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,000
Come on.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,080
Didn't you say you were going to buy us dinner?

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,760
Exactly.

238
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,000
This won't do.

239
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,640
Zhao Yan.

240
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,440
That's not what you said

241
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,160
when you came to my office

242
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
to ask for some time off.

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,920
Right.

244
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,640
If you don't come, Manager Wei will...

245
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Alright. I'll go.

246
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,960
Let me pack up first.

247
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Oh, by the way.

248
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't take your car.

249
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
You're taking mine.

250
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
Seriously?

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
Hurry up, we'll wait for you.

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,520
Brother Kai.

253
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,240
I'll leave you to it.

254
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm gonna grab something to eat first.

255
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
Go ahead.

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,040
Won't he be full then?

257
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,920
Pass me the salt.

258
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,840
Convenient and delicious.

259
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,640
This self-heating hot pot

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,960
is a must-have for camping.

261
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,680
Boss.

262
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Boss is here.

263
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
It's a day off, why are you scared?

264
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,560
The purpose of having a team-building event is to

265
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,280
improve the relationship between Boss and us.

266
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
That's not it.

267
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,400
Look at their outfits.

268
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,720
His style did change.

269
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
Are you blind?

270
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,880
The matching black and white outfits, you idiot.

271
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,520
Brother Kai.

272
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,680
-Jia Jia. Sister Hong.
-Xiao Ning.

273
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Mr. Gu.

274
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,880
Mr. Gu.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,760
New clothes?

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,160
Looking good!

277
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
Looks good on Xiao Ning too.

278
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,920
Yes, yes.

279
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Pretty.

280
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,920
Mr. Gu.

281
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,560
Take some rest first.

282
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,520
The food will be ready right away.

283
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,200
Xiao Ning,

284
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,080
take a seat too.

285
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
It's okay, Brother Kai.

286
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,720
Let me do the cooking.

287
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,440
No way.

288
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,760
You must be tired after driving for the entire day.

289
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,480
Let me.

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Thanks, Brother Kai.

291
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,560
Over here, Xiao Ning.

292
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,520
Mr. Gu.

293
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,640
I know you're not used to eating these.

294
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,880
I asked them to pick up

295
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,680
some food for you from a restaurant.

296
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,000
It'll be delivered shortly.

297
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
No worries.

298
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,800
Let me.

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
No way.

300
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,600
It's fine.

301
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,680
There's smoke here.

302
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,760
This...

303
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Brother Kai.

304
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,920
You go take a break. I'll help Boss.

305
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Okay, okay.

306
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
You can take care of other thins.

307
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,880
It's okay.

308
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,120
Jiang Xiao Ning,

309
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,200
you still have unfinished work.

310
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Can you finish everything

311
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
by noon tomorrow?

312
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,400
Got it, Sister Man Lin.

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,680
Brother Kai.

314
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
After driving the whole day, I'm pretty tired.

315
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
Plus, I have a bunch of work to finish.

316
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,560
I'll go back first.

317
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,360
Wait, don't go.

318
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,760
Have some of Mr. Gu's meat.

319
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,440
I mean,

320
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,880
have some of the meat Mr. Gu roasted

321
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,640
before leaving.

322
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,560
I'm good.

323
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,360
You guys enjoy it.

324
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm heading back first.

325
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,000
Xiao Ning.

326
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I know you're tough on yourself,

327
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
but you can't starve yourself.

328
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Take these with you.

329
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
Let me see what else is here.

330
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,280
The cauliflower is ready.

331
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm giving this to Xiao Ning

332
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,800
so she can take it with her.

333
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Thanks.

334
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,280
Be careful. It's hot.

335
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Here's the room key.

336
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,800
Go get some rest.

337
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Thank you, Sister Hong.

338
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,400
You're welcome.

339
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,880
Go on.

340
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,920
Boss, I'm leaving.

341
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,240
Mr. Gu.

342
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,320
Mr. Gu.

343
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
You should have some rest too.

344
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,680
Let Cheng Dong do it.

345
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,040
It's alright.

346
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,160
There's no "Mr. Gu" here today.

347
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,080
We should all have fun.

348
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,440
Exactly! Have fun!

349
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,360
Everyone,

350
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,560
raise your glass.

351
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,160
Let's...

352
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Mr. Gu.

353
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
thank Mr. Gu.

354
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Mr. Gu, thank you

355
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,920
for getting us together

356
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,600
and building

357
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
such a big and lovely family.

358
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,200
To Chuan Design Studios!

359
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Cheers!

360
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,840
Cheers!

361
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
Boss.

362
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,080
What are you doing here?

363
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
You didn't finish eating, did you?

364
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,960
I can't eat that stuff.

365
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,240
Didn't you say you were going to

366
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,640
cook something delicious for me yesterday?

367
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Oh, right.

368
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,200
I made congee.

369
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,520
Boss, come in first.

370
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,440
Boss, sit anywhere you like.

371
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,640
I'll go get the congee.

372
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
Vegetable shrimp congee.

373
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
It took me one whole night to make it.

374
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,040
The temperature should be just right.

375
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Low oil and salt. Not spicy.

376
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,600
The shrimps have been deshelled as well.

377
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,800
Smells pretty good.

378
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,920
How is it?

379
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,240
Are you not going to eat?

380
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,720
This is all wrong.

381
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,280
Boss.

382
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,120
How did you know

383
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,520
what I was struggling with?

384
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Only one look is enough to tell me

385
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,640
you're stuck again.

386
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
You're the savior

387
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,120
that God has sent to help me.

388
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,240
You are so smart.

389
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,400
I just want to

390
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,320
have a bowl of congee in peace.

391
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,520
It looks much better this way.

392
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
If there's anything you don't understand,

393
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
just come ask me directly.

394
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,760
You knowing what to do is an asset to me as well.

395
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,960
Yes, sir.

396
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
Fireworks.

397
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,080
It's so beautiful.

398
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,960
Impressive.

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,400
I haven't seen fireworks

405
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
in a long time.

406
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
If you like it,

407
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,520

410
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,320
Boss,

411
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,280
look at the stars.

412
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,120
I haven't looked up just to

413
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,640
see the stars in a long time.

414
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,920
The city is developing.

415
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,520
Everyone

416
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
is so busy every day.

417
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,800
Plus, there's pollution.

418
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,240
I haven't seen a night sky like this

419
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,920
in a really long time.

420
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,080
That's why we need to cherish what we have now.

421
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
Happiness is when we are able to
look up at something.

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
True.

423
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,560
Happiness is when we are able to
look up at something.

424
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,840
Boss,

425
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,080
make a wish!

426
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,320
I don't have one.

427
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Then I'll borrow your wish.

428
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
Can you even borrow that?

429
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,560
The first wish I'd like to make

430
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,600
is that I wish my aunt, my grandma,

431
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
all of my friends,

432
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
and colleagues

433
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
good health.

434
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
Health comes first.

435
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,880
My second wish is

436
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,760
that our company earns lots and lots of money

437
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
so that I can get a raise.

438
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
You directed that part

439
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
at me, didn't you?

440
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,120
My third wish

441
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
is about something that I can't tell you.

442
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,200
I can guess it even if you don't say it.

443
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,520
You must be

444
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,960
saying something bad about me.

445
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,200
No.

446
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
No, I didn't, Boss.

447
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,000
You'd better be telling the truth.

448
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,220
♪I feel the love when you're by my side♪

449
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,600
What did you wish for?

450
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,480
I wish I could meet

451
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,520
my Mr. Right soon. You?

452
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,920
To become a billionaire.

453
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
To be richer than a country.

454
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,680
Richer than a country.

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,960
Zhao Yan, I'll go first.

456
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,200
Bye.

457
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,280
Slowly.

458
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,240
Bye, Manager Wei.

459
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,040
Xiao Yan.

460
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Our department should

461
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,680
get together more often in the future.

462
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,600
People having a great time together,

463
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,360
isn't that great?

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Alright, go home and rest.

465
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
I'm leaving now.

466
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,400
Goodbye.

467
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,600
Good night.

468
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,400
Mom.

469
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Dad.

470
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm so scared.

471
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
Don't be.

472
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
I will always be with you.

473
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,560
(Big brother.)

474
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,920
(Big brother.)

475
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,640
(Big brother.)

476
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,560
(What's wrong? Your hand is so cold.)

477
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
Don't.

478
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Don't.

479
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,640
Don't.

480
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
Don't grill the eggplants.

481
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,000
Just grill the ribs.

482
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,040
More cumin

483
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
and a little bit of chili.

484
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,440
Mr. Gu.

485
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,480
Still awake?

486
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
Um...

487
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
What's wrong?

488
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,400
I think I went to the wrong room.

489
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,600
I was going to bring you some food,

490
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,200
but no one answered.

491
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,680
So you live here?

492
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,720
No.

493
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,600
Jiang Xiao Ning lives here.

494
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,840
She's working.

495
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
I couldn't sleep,

496
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,320
so I thought I could check on her.

497
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,480
How's Jiang Xiao Ning?

498
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
Did she finish her work?

499
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,440
Is it the workload too much for her

500
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
that she needs someone to help her out?

501
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,760
It's alright.

502
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,040
You also know

503
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,200
we all have been through this phase,

504
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
working in this industry.

505
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,680
Mr. Gu...

506
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
It's nothing.

507
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
I just feel

508
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,400
that you've changed quite a lot recently.

509
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,000
You're a lot more relaxed.

510
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm happy for you.

511
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Really?

512
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,600
Thank you.

513
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,960
If there's nothing else,

514
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
I'll go back first.

515
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,240
You neither shut your door

516
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,480
nor picked up your phone.

517
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,280
You didn't think that I would worry, did you?

518
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,200
What's with your company

519
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,160
and your job?

520
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,920
Making you this drunk every day.

521
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,120
It's nice having a man

522
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,640
in the house.

523
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,240
No, no, I can't drink anymore.

524
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,240
Sorry.

525
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,040
Alright, no more drinking.

526
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
Since you're here,

527
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,680
let's talk things through.

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,920
Don't move!

529
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,800
What did you ask me?

530
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
My company?

531
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,400
How can I not know

532
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,160
what those people are thinking?

533
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I won't be tricked

534
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,760
because I've never seen them

535
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,800
as human beings.

536
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,080
And you too.

537
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,360
I won't be tricked by you either.

538
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,400
Don't laugh.

539
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,880
I'm going to beat you up if you laugh.

540
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,040
You.

541
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,520
You.

542
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,040
Do you know why I beat you?

543
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,800
Ask me.

544
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,200
Come on, ask me.

545
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,280
Why?

546
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,560
I don't know either.

547
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,600
I learned Sanda

548
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,360
because I thought

549
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,920
I could protect myself

550
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
and make myself stronger.

551
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,280
But I realized later this isn't the case.

552
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,120
In this world,

553
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,520
a lot of things

554
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
are unsolvable.

555
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,720
You don't have the ability

556
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,520
to protect yourself at all.

557
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,080
That's why you need me.

558
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,680
Do you know?

559
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,640
When I was little,

560
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,040
I just wanted to grow up faster

561
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,560
and faster.

562
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,760
That way,

563
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,520
I can live the

564
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,960
care-free life

565
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,760
and do as I please.

566
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,320
I thought I was different

567
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,360
from all the other girls

568
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,200
that I didn't need hugs

569
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,160
and protection.

570
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,760
But then I realized,

571
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,720
I'm worse than them.

572
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,920
I'm too average.

573
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,480
There is nothing special about me.

574
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,120
You are special to me.

575
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
I want to sing.

576
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840

Thank goodness Boss left already.

598
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,920
I wonder when though.

599
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,080
I hope I didn't drool.

600
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't think I did.

601
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,680
Good morning, Boss.

602
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,080
Morning.

603
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
Boss, did you sleep well last night?

604
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
Very well.

605
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,160
What about you?

606
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,120
It was great!

607
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,680
Thank goodness someone got me a blanket,

608
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,040
or I would've gotten sick for sure.

609
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,840
Let's go get some breakfast.

610
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,480
Sure.

611
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't eat enough last night.

612
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,760
Starting now,

613
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,880
you're free to do what you want.

614
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,640
I will give these

615
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,640
travel brochures to you.

616
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,440
Around here, there are theme parks,

617
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
ancient towns, scenic areas,

618
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,960
basically everything.

619
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,440
Thanks.

620
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,240
We'll meet after dinner.

621
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,280
Mr. Gu

622
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,080
will join us

623
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
and we'll have a karaoke party!

624
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,400
How's that?

625
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Cool.

626
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,280
Listen up, listen up.

627
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Don't get lost.

628
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,440
Don't get lost.

629
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,000
This is not a field trip

630
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
for elementary school students.

631
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,520
Who would get lost?

632
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,520
If your IQ

633
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
reaches half of that
of an elementary school student,

634
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,400
I wouldn't be worried.

635
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,240
Stop messing around.

636
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,880
Where do you plan to go?

637
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,520
Of course the theme park.

638
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Theme parks are so fun.

639
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,240
There's also

640
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,320
a huge Ferris wheel

641
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,120
in this theme park.

642
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,560
How romantic!

643
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,480
That's great!

644
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,440
This is for you kids.

645
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,440
I'm not going.

646
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,640
I plan on finding a quiet place

647
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,960
and enjoying the scenery.

648
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
I'll check out the bridge.

649
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,440
Bridge?

650
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
Bridge?

651
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,560
There's a bridge

652
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,720
with a long history here.

653
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,320
I've only seen it in books.

654
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm here already so why not go check it out.

655
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,040
It's not far.

656
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,560
I'll be back before dark.

657
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm going to the ancient town.

658
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,480
Maybe I could shop around.

659
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,960
Miss Su,

660
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,600
where are you going?

661
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm not sure yet.

662
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,440
Mr. Gu, where do you plan to go?

663
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll probably just walk around.

664
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,040
Xiao Ning, do you want to come with us?

665
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,240
Will there be a lot of people at the theme park?

666
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Will the queue time be long?

667
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
How far is the bridge?

668
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,160
How many years of history does it have?

669
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,800
Will there be a lot of delicious food

670
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,880
in the ancient town?

671
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,680
Is it a real ancient town

672
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,440
or just one built

673
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,480
for tourism?

674
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,720
A curious kid.

675
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,600
Jiang Xiao Ning,

676
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
come here.

677
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
You got some data wrong last night.

678
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,680
Poor Jiang Xiao Ning.

679
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,440
What mistakes did she make

680
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,200
that it has to be brought up
during the team-building event?

681
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,520
I want Mr. Gu to bring up my mistake

682
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,240
during the team-building event as well.

683
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
It means he cares.

684
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,480
Never mind.

685
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,080
It's better that he doesn't care.

686
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,080
I hope

687
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,440
he never sees me.

688
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,320
But he has to pay me regardless.

689
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,360
Miss Su,

690
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,440
what do you say?

691
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,520
Where do you want to go?

692
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
I'm a little dizzy.

693
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,040
I'm going to sleep.

694
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
Always like that.

695
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
Why are you here?

696
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
Where is this?

697
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,200
You're asking me that?

698
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
You got so drunk last night

699
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,720
that you didn't even close the door.

700
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,040
You're lucky that it was me who walked in.

701
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
What if it was a bad guy?

702
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,080
Thank you.

703
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,440
No problem.

704
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,080
I'm all good.

705
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,520
You can leave now.

706
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
I'm good too.

707
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,560
I rescheduled everything

708
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,520
to stay with you.

709
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,760
Who's your boss?

710
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,920
He got you this drunk.

711
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,520
I need to go make him pay.

712
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,360
You didn't understand me.

713
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,800
I mean

714
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,240
you can leave my home now.

715
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
I need to stay to take care of you.

716
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,920
I don't need to be taken care of.

717
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,240
You're my girlfriend.

718
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,280
Who else would I take care of?

719
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm not your girlfriend.

720
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
You are.

721
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,920
I'm not.

722
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,560
You are.

723
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,840
Between you and me,

724
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
who got drunk last night?

725
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,880
We are separate individuals.

726
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,800
There is nothing

727
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,920
between us.

728
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,320
Why do I not understand?

729
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,840
You do understand.

730
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,960
But that day,

731
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,560
we had already...

732
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,840
Just pretend you had a dream

733
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,160
and that dream came true.

734
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,200
Congratulations.

735
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,520
A dream?

736
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,280
Zhao Yan, what are you talking about?

737
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,800
Who do you think I am?

738
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,680
I have always been the one

739
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,160
to say these things to a girl.

740
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,200
Isn't that even better?

741
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
That means we are the same type of people.

742
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,480
So I don't need to explain any further.

743
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,920
I don't care.

744
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,360
You need to be responsible for me.

745
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,280
Can't you tell

746
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,160
how much I like you?

747
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,000
Can't you tell how serious I am?

748
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,600
It's my problem, alright?

749
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,440
I don't trust love

750
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,760
and I don't need love.

751
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
You've hurt me.

752
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,240
Zhao Yan, you indeed have hurt me.

753
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,840
What do you want me to tell you?

754
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,600
You want me to tell you

755
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,240
that you need to be responsible for me

756
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,200
and I'll love you for my entire life.

757
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,760
Right, I should say

758
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,760
"Oh my gosh, I love you so much.

759
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,360
Let's be together for life

760
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,120
and never leave each other,

761
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,200
please?"

762
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
How about that?

763
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,600
Anyhow, I'm not breaking up with you.

764
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
Don't ever think of getting rid of me.

765
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,200
I don't like you.

766
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,720
Give me a chance.

767
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,640
I'll make you

768
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,880
fall for me.

769
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,240
I don't want to date anyone.

770
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,000
Who said we have to date each other?

771
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
Xu Cheng Ran, your good friend,

772
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,440
is officially online from today.

773
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,400
Yan Yan,

774
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
I'll become your man sooner or later.

775
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Get out.

776
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,040
Get out of here now.

777
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,240
I'll send someone to

778
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,720
bring you the hangover soup.

779
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,080
Take care of yourself.
