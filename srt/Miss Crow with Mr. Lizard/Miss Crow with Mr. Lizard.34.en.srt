what will happen to his mechanical heart?

Safe Mode will automatically be activated.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Safe Mode?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,280
(Based on what you told me,)

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
(Mr. Gu's mechanical heart)

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080

(In other words,)

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,440
(he can't feel)

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,320
(Care instructions, Warning)
any emotions now

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
(Care instructions, Warning)
and it turns him

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,120
into a vegetable who can still talk and walk.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,040
He might not have

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
any emotions now.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
But at least,

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
it can keep him alive for a while.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,000
How long

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,800
can his mechanical heart last

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
if Safe Mode is activated?

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,600
It's hard to say.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
But all the previous cases

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,320
didn't last for more than a year.

frame is about a year.)

(you can look on the bright side.)

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480

I'm just curious.

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
Was it fun?

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,440
Or were there lingering fears

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,880
that make you wake up with a start

Then, I had to face punishment.

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,280
After going to jail,

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,720
there was endless torment.

91
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Regret and guilt.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Honestly,

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
if I were given another chance

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,640
to choose again,

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,880
I would never

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,320
take a dime of anyone's money.

97
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
I think it's nothing.

98
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
Everyone's money is just the same.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,560
What you said

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
is the feeling after being caught.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,960
If you hadn't been arrested

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,920
and no one came after you

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,440
for taking their money,

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
you wouldn't regret or feel guilty.

105
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell me.

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
If I were to follow

107
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
in your footsteps,

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,760
how fun would that be?

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
Why are you yelling?

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,760
Look, Xiao Xu.

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
Did something happen?

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,600
If there's anything,

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
you have to tell me.

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,120
You don't have to hide it from me, all right?

116
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
Yes, I know.

117
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,840
All right.

118
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
I told you. I was just saying nonsense.

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,840
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Drink up.

121
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,400

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,680
No...

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Drink up.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,640
Sir.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Sir, where are you going?

126
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Sir, who are you looking for?

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm here for Director Xu.

128
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,760
Sir, you can't go inside.

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,480
Sir.

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
Director Xu, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,000
I couldn't stop him.

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
It's so hard to get a chance to meet you.

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
Director Xu.

134
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Tang.

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,240
Long time no see.

136
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,159
Long time no see.

137
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
Is it that hard to meet me?

138
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Don't say that.

139
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,360
Here. Take a seat.

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,200
Here.

141
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,679
It was my bad.

142
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,400
Look, now that you're out,

143
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
I should have paid you a visit.

144
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
But you have to come to me instead.

145
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
It's my fault.

146
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm here to take some thing.

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
Take some thing?

148
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
What is it?

149
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm here to claim

150
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
what you should have given to me.

151
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
I didn't spend ten years in jail

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,800
for nothing.

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,120
You didn't forget

154
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
your promise, right?

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
I've kept my promise,

156
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,760
Tang.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
I raised Tang Xu

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
and gave him the best life

159
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
and the best education.

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
I made him an executive in the company.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,000
Right?

162
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,600
So...

163
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
What else I didn't do?

164
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,040
How dare you bring up Tang Xu?

165
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,240
All these years,

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
how have you treated him?

167
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,200
Did you think I couldn't tell

168
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,000
how he felt hard done by all these years?

169
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,320
Wait.

170
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
He felt hard done by?

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
It's me who feels hard done by!

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,160
Tang.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,760
If you here

174
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,760
to talk about this,

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,320
I...

176
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,960
There's nothing to

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,760
talk about between us.

178
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
So you're kicking me out?

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
Xu Guo Xiang.

180
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,080
You haven't forgotten what happened

181
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
ten years ago, right?

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,600
Do you need me to remind you?

183
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,440
Tang.

184
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Think about it.

185
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,640
You're the project manager.

186
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,760
You can't get away

187
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
with it anyway.

188
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,400
But have you thought about it?

189
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
If you're put behind bars,

190
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,840
what's going to happen to your wife and kid?

191
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,920
I heard that your wife

192
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,960
does not have a permanent job

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,480
and your son is still young.

194
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,040
How are they going to live? Have you
thought about that?

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,520
Just keep me out of it.

196
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
Even if you're put behind bars,

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
it'll just be a few years.

198
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll take care

199
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,360
of your wife and son.

200
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
I'll send your son

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
to college, to study abroad,

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,320
and even make him a shareholder.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,160
It's all on me.

204
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,040
It's just a few years.

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,360
Tang.

206
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
No problem.

207
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,560
I can promise you that.

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,760
This amount of money

209
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,520
isn't a big deal.

210
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,600
I can give you twice the amount.

211
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,280
But...

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
not anymore.

213
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,320
Because your Tang Xu

214
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
was such a disappointment. Do you know that?

215
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
But because

216
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,720
he's your son,

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,800
I let things slide.

218
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
But I have a record here.

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,960
Take a look.

220
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,880
That will get him decades of imprisonment.

221
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,380
(Jiangdong Commercial Bank, Personal account
transaction details)

222
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Xu Guo Xiang, you're a scumbag.

223
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,080
You're obviously

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,160
using Tang Xu!

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
How dare you...

226
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Let go of me!

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,480
Don't move.

228
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,120
Tang.

229
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,760
I just don't get it.

230
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,440
You're not young anymore.

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,640
Why are you still so impulsive?

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,320
And you're so brainless.

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
If I don't have something on Tang Xu,

234
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
do you think I can trust you?

235
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Listen up, Xu Guo Xiang!

236
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,960
If you dare to hurt Tang Xu,

237
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,800
I'll fight you till the end!

238
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Assistant Liu.

239
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
He's too noisy. Throw him out.

240
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,880
Move.

241
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,640
Move.

242
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,400
I won't spare you!

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
A mad dog.

244
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
What should I do?

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,480
I miss you so much and it's only been a day.

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,240
Why didn't you reply to my message yesterday?

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,960
I miss you so much

248
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
that words alone

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
can't express how I feel.

250
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,160
How was Grandma's check-up?

251
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,400
It was good.

252
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,800
As usual. It's just her dementia.

253
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,320
What's wrong?

254
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
Nothing.

255
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm just hungry.

256
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,920
What would you like to eat? I'll cook for you.

257
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,560
So you still care about me.

258
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,240
Why would you say that?

259
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,360
I used to be the one who cooked for you.

260
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,040
From now on, I'll cook for you.

261
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,920
What would you like to eat?

262
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,880
I love anything

263
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
that you make.

264
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,040
Really?

265
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
I...

266
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,520
You go first.

267
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,280
How about taking a walk

268
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,880
after dinner?

269
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Where to? Is it far?

270
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,680
Just around here.

271
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,400
Okay, I'll go with you.

272
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,400
I have something to tell you.

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
Let's eat.

274
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,840
I'll try the soup that you made.

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
(It looks like)

276
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,840
(the safe mode has been activated.)

277
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
(Is it going to end like this?)

278
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,280
(Stop trying out anything,)

279
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,920
(will you?)

280
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,360
(Let things stay the same they are)

281
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
(and it's good enough already.)

282
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,080
Why did you bring me here?

283
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
Just feel like coming here.

284
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
Did you forget this place?

285
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,360

You read this too?

You can have it if you want.

290
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,000
It's the last one in the store.

291
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Okay, I'll take it then.

292
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,240
What's wrong?

293
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,320
Nothing.

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
although you made a detour,

343
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
you believe

344
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,520
that as long as we keep walking,

345
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
we'll be able to reach our destination.

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,760
Do you still remember?

347
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,280
Gu Chuan.

348
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,400
What's wrong?

349
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,800
Stop reminiscing the past.

350
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,280
Why not?

351
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,200
I just don't want to.

352
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,400
These are

353
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
the beautiful memories we had.

354
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,840
Why can't we reminisce about it?

355
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
Perhaps, if I try harder,

356
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,320
I'll be able to...

357
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,400
What?

358
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,720
So the safe mode can be deactivated?

359
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,960
How did you know?

360
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
I went to see Qing Zi.

361
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,120
You wanted to see me?

362
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,120
Why did you do that?

363
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,560
What did I do?

364
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,160
Why did you embezzle public funds?

365
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,440
Xiao Xu.

366
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,080
Have you forgotten

367
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,560
why I was put in jail for ten years?

368
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Who told you that?

369
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,160
Did you go to see Xu Guo Xiang?

370
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,400
Xiao Xu.

371
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,640
How could you do that?

372
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,040
It's a crime. You'll be jailed.

373
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,680
You're still young.

374
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
You can't go down the wrong path!

375
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,600
Look.

376
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,560
Look what our family turned into

377
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
because of my imprisonment.

378
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Dad, don't worry.

379
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,080
I didn't embezzle public funds.

380
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,280
What is it then?

381
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
I took Xu Guo Xiang's dirty money

382
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,360
that can't be known by the public.

383
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,200
He set up a company

384
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,080
in my name

385
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
a long time ago

386
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,600
to help him

387
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,840
launder money from unknown sources.

388
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,520
Since he's

389
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
treating me this way,

390
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll just go along with it

391
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,200
and cause him unspeakable sufferings.

392
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Karma.

393
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Karma!

394
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,820
(Jiangdong Commercial Bank)

395
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,640
(These are useless now.)

396
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,840
(It won't pose a threat)

397
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,280
(to Xu Guo Xiang anymore.)

398
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,440
Sorry for meeting Qing Zi

399
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,520
without telling you first.

400
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,600
She told you everything?

401
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,440
Yes.

402
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,840
So let's stop trying, all right?

403
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm afraid to hold your hands,

404
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,640
hug you,

405
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,840
or look you into the eyes

406
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,840
because I'm scared that

407
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,280
anything could happen to you.

408
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
I just want you to be safe.

409
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,440
To wait for death?

410
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
Qing Zi said

411
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
at least

412
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,640
things can remain as they are for some time.

413
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,320
Maybe during this period of time,

414
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,120
other labs might come up

415
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,480
with new solutions.

416
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,520
Look on the bright side.

417
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,800
Since Qing Zi has told you everything,

418
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm sure you know

419
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,160
it will not last more than a year

420
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,880
after the safe mode is activated.

421
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,320
I don't want to live like a machine,

422
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,400
being unable to feel happiness or pain,

423
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,960
or have the feeling of loving someone
and being loved.

424
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,240
I don't want to live a life

425
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
without hope

426
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,800
and emotion like before.

427
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,080
Also,

428
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,840
the most unbearable thing

429
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,560
is not being able

430
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,000
to love you.

431
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,480
Stop.

432
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,320
Look, just like now.

433
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
I can feel

434
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,360
the warmth of your body.

435
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,840
But I don't feel anything in my heart.

436
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I know. I get it.

437
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,000
But still, I hope

438
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
that I can buy more time

439
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,600
with you.

440
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,720
Not just for me.

441
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
The same goes for your parents,

442
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,240
Mr. Xu,

443
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,200
and our colleagues at Chuan Design Studio.

444
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
I shouldn't have said these to you.

446
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,040
How's your heart now?

447
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,960
It's fine.

448
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,760
Don't worry.

449
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
There won't be any electricity discharge anymore.

450
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,620
(Reindeer Group's New Fiscal Year Public
Welfare Plan Press Conference)

451
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm Xu Cheng Ran,

453
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,280
the CEO

454
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,000
of Reindeer Group.

455
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,480
Today, on behalf

456
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,440
of the Reindeer Group,

457
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm announcing

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,760
the group's public welfare plan
for the new fiscal year

459
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,120
and also

460
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,520
our overall plan for the next 10 years.

461
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,920
We are serious about doing charity.

462
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,400
What I'm about to say today

463
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,720
is a promise to be kept.

464
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
We'll walk the talk.

465
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
Isn't the plan

466
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,160
only for the new fiscal year?

467
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,480
He'd better not talk drivel.

468
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
There are so many journalists

469
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,520
and live broadcasts.

470
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,080
What are we going to do?

471
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,280
It was one of those spur-of-the-moment enthusiasms.

472
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,920
As long as it's not out of line,

473
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,640
I think

474
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,200
it won't hurt. It's fine.

475
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,600
Ten years ago, from Dongjiang Real Estate

476
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,120
to the Reindeer Group today.

477
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
We have gone through a lot of things

478
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,440
and many trials and hardships.

479
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Because of your companionship,

480
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,600
Reindeer Group

481
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
is able to come this far.

482
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,560
We have always had the idea

483
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,920
of giving back to the society

484
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,920
and repaying society.

485
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,040
Therefore, the group publicly promises

486
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
to donate 4 percent

487
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
of the group's annual income

488
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
to charities every year

489
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
in the future.

490
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,440
That's just nonsense.

491
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,800
It is clearly stated

492
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,760
in the plan as 0.5 percent.

493
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,080
That's right. Quickly stop him.

494
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,880
Cheng Ran.

495
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
You've made a mistake.

496
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,720
It's written in the plan

497
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,120
as 0.5 percent.

498
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,120
No.

499
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,280
It's 4 percent.

500
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,760
The detailed donation plan

501
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
is right here.

502
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,360
As the CEO

503
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,160
of the group,

504
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
I'll not make a baseless statement.

505
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,640
Like I said earlier,

506
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:54,688
Reindeer Group

507
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,800
is serious about doing charity.

508
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,080
We'll honor our words

509
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,680
and walk the talk.

510
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
Nice one!

511
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,440
Awesome!

512
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,440
We have done

513
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
all the measurements here.

514
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,360
For buildings by the lake,

515
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
the first thing to consider

516
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
is the anti-corrosion problem.

517
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
The climate around here

518
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,880
is always humid.

519
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,880
It's a big challenge

520
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
when it comes to the wall and the roof.

521
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,800
So we must follow

522
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,560
the design plan strictly.

523
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,040
You cannot change the materials.

524
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,920
All right.

525
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,080
Get out of the way!

526
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,144
Jiang Xiao Ning!

527
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,160
Are you all right?

528
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,320
Help!

529
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,160
How is she?

530
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,360
Is she all right?

531
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
- Call the ambulance!
- What do we do?

532
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Hurry!

533
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,240
All right.

534
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,860
(Outpatient)

535
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,440
Cheng Dong.

536
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Boss, you're here.

537
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,640
Where's Jiang Xiao Ning? How is she?

538
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
It was too dangerous just now.

539
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,640
Jiang Xiao Ning pushed me away,

540
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,240
but...

541
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,640
She...

542
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960

559
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,600
(Hi, Mr. Gu.)

560
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,040
(How can I help you?)

561
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,400
Do you have knowledge about the safe mode?

562
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,600
Yes.

563
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,600
Is there any way

564
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,480
to exit Safe Mode

565
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,040
and return to Normal Mode?

566
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,160
By restoring the initial settings,

567
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,240
the mechanical heart

568
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,200
can be reset to the normal mode.

569
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,440
But that is only a change

570
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,240
in the software.

571
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,880
The hardware problem still exists.

572
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
In simpler words?

573
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,240
In other words,

574
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,560
the safe mode allows you

575
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
to live for another year.

576
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,800
The normal mode

577
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,040
may only last you a month.

578
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,040
(In short, your remaining time)

579
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,040
(will be greatly shortened.)

580
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,120
Okay.

581
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
Help me restore to Normal Mode.

582
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,720
(Mr. Gu.)

583
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,920
(Are you sure you want to do that?)

584
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,960
Was my explanation

585
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,720
not clear earlier?

586
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,960
Do you need me

587
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
to repeat it for you?

588
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,480
Although the time left

589
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,400
will be shortened,

590
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,080
at least, I won't be like how I am now.

591
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,440
My current situation

592
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,560
is not different from being dead.

This charity project

598
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,560
is good for the image

599
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,400
of the group.

600
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,880
But this investment ratio

601
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
is too big, don't you think?

602
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,520
So much money is squandered

603
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,199
every year.

604
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,239
Tell me.

605
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,960
What will

606
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,920
the shareholders think?

607
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,639
You should consider

608
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,560
our feelings!

609
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,440
I think

610
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,080
I have fully considered

611
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
the feelings of all the directors.

612
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,440
I've taken a stand on this

613
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,360
at the press conference.

614
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,679
If you can accept it,

615
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,600
I'll stay

616
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
to clean up your mess.

617
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,440
If not,

618
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,840
you can dismiss me with immediate effect

619
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
and declare that

620
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
the last press conference was invalid.

621
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,880
I'll no longer

622
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,040
be the CEO of this company.

623
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,840

what you have done carefully.

627
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,000
The previous charitable donations

628
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,520
were all fake.

629

you were so willful.

Yes.

654
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,560
The most willful thing I have done

655
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
is pursuing you.

656
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
The more you play hard to get,

657
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
the more intense I get

658
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,960
and I just had to marry you.

659
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,800
What now? Do you regret it?

660
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,480
I didn't say that.

661
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,600
What do you think

662
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
of your husband now?

663
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,080
Well.

664
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
I never thought

665
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
you would have such cool ideas.

666
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,920
Of course. What did you expect?

667
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Your husband has great fundamental values.

668
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,400
Look at you. Getting all smug.

669
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,640
Are you starting to think

670
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,560
that I'm the real catch?

671
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Almost.

672
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,240
Look.

673
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,800
You can never

674
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,280
escape from me.

675
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,560
The word "escape"

676
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
doesn't exist in my dictionary.

677
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,880
Here. Take a seat.

678
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm perfectly fine.

679
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,640
If so,

680
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,440
how about some revision?

681
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,120
What's wrong?

682
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,600
Nothing.

683
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,720
Just feeling a little nervous.

684
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
The maturity examination

685
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,320
is too important to me.

686
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,040
I must get a degree

687
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,400
in order to become a designer.

688
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,120
I don't have a chance to take a makeup examination.

689
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,600
The thought of it scares me

690
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,840
and it makes me nervous.

691
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
I didn't get to make any preparations

692
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
while I was in the hospital.

693
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,320
My mind is totally blank now.

694
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,240
Don't get nervous.

695
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,240
Just relax and answer the questions.

696
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
You'll be fine.

697
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,720
It's not as easy as that.

698
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,080
How about this?

699
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
To help relieve your stress and anxiety,

700
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,360
I can fulfill one wish for you.

701
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,200
Any wish?

702
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,600
Any wish.

703
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,480
It's a deal?

704
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,360
It's a deal.

705
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,200
It's getting late.

706
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,960
Why don't you stay here tonight?

707
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,360
It's close to the place where you're
having the exam.

708
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,120
I can drive you there tomorrow.

709
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,720
Really?

710
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,560
Look.

711
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,520
Although you're in the safe mode now,

712
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,640
you still care about me.

713
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,200
From what I see,

714
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,160
this is just a logical problem,

715
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,800
not an emotional problem.

716
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,920
I don't care.

717
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,280
Be it logical or emotional,

718
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,000
as long as you care about me,

719
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,840
that will make me happy.

720
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,440
All right. Quickly do your revision.

721
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,840

Mr. Gu, have you read everything?
