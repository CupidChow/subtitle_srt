Although the company and the lab

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,320
have already been shut down,

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,480
but we still have to go through

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,120
the necessary procedures.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,320
Please sign the consent form.

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,800
Mr. Gu, have you finished reading it?

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,520
Do you need to

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,759
reconsider your decision?

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,040
What do you mean?

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,040
You were

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,360
once our client

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,800
so we have to

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,520
satisfy all your requests,

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
but restoring

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,480
Normal Mode right now

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
is equivalent to committing suicide.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,160
This is unprecedented

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,200
because no one

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,760
wants to shorten their own lives.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
So, in my opinion,

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
you should reconsider it.

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
There's no need to.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
I've already made up my mind.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
Please restore it.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,160
Let's get started then.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,600
(Lifting Safe Mode)

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,640
Are you done with the exam?

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Excuse me, Miss.

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
Sir,

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,440
are you talking to me?

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,040
Yes.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
Are you waiting for someone?

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,160
Yes.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Then, I'd like to ask,

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,800
are you waiting for your girlfriend?

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,320
Of course.

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,880
I can't keep chatting with you.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,800
Otherwise, when my girlfriend comes out

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
and sees us,

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,760
she'll get jealous.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Nonsense.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm not that petty.

64
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Here. Your favorite.

65
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
Thank you.

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
So refreshing.

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
How did the exam go?

68
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
Hardly encountered any difficulties.

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,360
It's hard not to get a high score

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,080
after being tutored by a nice teacher.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,160
And did you know?

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,320
There was a question

73
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
which we had encountered

74
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,440
in our art gallery project.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,880
I had the answer right away.

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Say...

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
This...

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,760
How come you smile all of a sudden?

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,680
I haven't seen

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
you smile in such a long time.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't like smiling before

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
but I'm trying to

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
go along with your good mood

85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
so you can relax.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,320
I thought...

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,680
What?

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,760
What are you thinking?

89
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm finally done with the exam.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
Should we celebrate?

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
To celebrate...

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Shall we go to...

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
The old family house.
-The old family house.

94
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Then I'll bring my grandma

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,080
and my aunt too.

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,680
Sure.

97
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,320
Let's go.

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
Mom.

99
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
She's asleep.

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,280
Mom.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Mom. Are you asleep?

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,880
Where are we?

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
Guess.

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,080
I think I recognize this road.

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,280
Are we going home?

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes, we're going home.

107
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,520
We're going home.

108
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
Going home.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Look how happy my mom is.

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
This looks exactly like

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
our old family house.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,360
Mom. Come and take a look.

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,920
Is it?

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
Can you still recognize it?

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
This is our home.

116
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
How can I not recognize it?

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,440
Really.

118
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,120
This is great.

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,920
The walls and the foundation are done.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
Its exterior appearance won't change too much.

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Grandma will recognize

122
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,040
this is our house with just one glimpse.

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Xiao Ning.

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
You've really made something of yourself.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,760
I'm so happy.

126
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,480
You're finishing

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,200
what your dad

128
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,520
couldn't.

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,840
I get emotional when talking about this.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Aunty, this is something to be happy about.

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,680
Let's stop being sad.

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
Right. I'll stop.

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Mr. Gu.

134
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,320
I know that

135
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,480
you are the one

136
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
who has done most of what we see here.

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,400
But since

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,960
we're going to be

139
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
family in the future,

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I won't

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,240
say thank you.

142
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
You're welcome, Aunty.

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
Aunty, what are you talking about?

144
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,480
Gu Chuan, why aren't

145
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,680
the workers here today?

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
It's their day off.

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,200
When you come here tomorrow,

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
remind them that

149
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,760
the waterproof layer isn't thick enough.

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,880
Okay.

151
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,120
The yard looks so pretty

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,640
after it has been cleaned up.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
I came back after such a long time.

154
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,280
I have to go visit our old neighbors.

155
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,080
Mom, don't scare me.

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
How come you're not forgetful now?

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,240
You keep saying I'm a forgetful old lady.
I don't like it.

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
OK, you don't like it.

159
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,000
Which neighbor do I not know?

160
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Alright, alright.

161
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,680
How about

162
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,440
you take me to visit

163
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
each and every one?

164
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
I haven't seen them in so long.

165
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't know them anymore.

166
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Grandma.

167
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,440
Mom.

168
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
-Mom, don't scare me like this.
-Grandma.

169
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,840
-Mom. Mom.
-Grandma.

170
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,500
(Operating room)

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,720
Don't be so anxious.

172
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,720
Grandma will be okay.

173
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,280
I kept thinking

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,480
that it can't be good

175
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,520
since she's been getting sleepy all the time.

176
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,400
But I didn't know

177
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,320
it would get this bad all of a sudden.

178
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
It's all my fault.

179
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,559
I shouldn't have brought her to the old family house.

180
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
How is this your fault?

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,360
It's okay.

182
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

183
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,820
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

184
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,360
Xiao Ning.

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,760
Uncle Tang. I'm sorry.

186
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm at the hospital.

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,960
I wasn't looking at my phone.

188
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Wait.

189
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,800
Why are you at the hospital?

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,880
Something went wrong with Grandma.

191
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,720
Where's the patient's family?

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
Doctor.

193
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Doctor.

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,920
How is my mom doing?

195
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,640
Relax. She's stable right now.

196
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
But her blood pressure is unstable,

197
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,200
causing severe damage to
the blood vessels in her brain.

198
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,600
The patient is already awake.

199
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
Let her rest more.

200
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,560
Doctor.

201
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,160
So everything is okay?

202
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,400
For now.

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,360
One of you

204
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
get the procedures done for her admission.

205
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
I'll handle it.

207
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
You and Aunty go take care of Grandma.

208
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Everything's okay, Aunty.

209
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
That really scared me.

210
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
There there. It's okay.

211
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,120
Granda is already awake.

212
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,220
(In-patient department)

213
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,880
Grandma.

214
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,520
Aunty, Grandma is awake.

215
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,160
Mom.

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
Mom, you're finally awake.

217
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,040
You almost scared me to death.

218
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm not dead yet.

219
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,400
Why are you crying?

220
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Grandma, Aunty is crying happy tears.

221
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,720
Happy tears.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,240
It's great as long as you've woken up.

223
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,920
I feel like

224
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
I was in a dream.

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,400
When I wake up, here I am.

226
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Mom.

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,760
It's great as long as you've woken up.

228
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,840
Uncle Tang.

229
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Here, just a little something.

230
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
Thank you, Uncle Tang.

231
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,520
Grandma, Uncle Tang came to see you.

232
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Xiao Mai.

233
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,880
Mrs. Jiang.

234
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,320
It's Guang Da.

235
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
Guang Da.

236
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
Don't get too emotional.

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,800
-Guang Da.
-Don't get too emotional.

238
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,760
Mom.

239
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,280
Guang Da.

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,080
He's not Guang Da.

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,520
He's the reason why Guang Da died.

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,640
Aunty.

243
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,800
Uncle Tang.

244
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Grandma has been having trouble
recognizing people these few years.

245
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,560
Why did it take you so long

246
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
to come back?

247
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
Were you busy with work?

248
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,200
Or did anyone judge you?

249
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,600
Just go along with what she says.

250
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
I've been...

251
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,400
really busy with work.

252
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,960
It's good to be busy.

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
At least, it's better than not having a job.

254
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
A lot of people

255
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,400
have been saying that you embezzled public funds.

256
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,080
Not only public funds

257
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,680
but also much of

258
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,680
the retired employees' pension.

259
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,760
Someone died because of it.

260
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,480
But I don't believe them.

261
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,400
I brought you up.

262
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,680
I know

263
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,600
what kind of person you are.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,240
You've been upright and kind
ever since you were a child.

265
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,160
You never made me worry.

266
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,560
I brought you and

267
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,000
Xiao Mai up by myself.

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Many people asked me

269
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
why I sent my kids away

270
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,400
from home to go to school.

271
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,880
I don't think they understand

272
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,200
that going to school is the only way out.

273
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,000
You are the only one of our family

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,560
that have achieved something.

275
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,640
Don't be scared.

276
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,320
Mom believes in you.

277
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,960
When you walk out that door,

278
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,800
you need to keep your head up.

279
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,840
We won't confess to anything

280
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,880
we have never done before.

281
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
Guang Da.

282
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,400
Guang Da.

283
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,600
I am not babying you

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,480
or being

285
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,320
partial to you because you're my son.

286
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,480
I know you're innocent.

287
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,760
You're innocent.

288
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,520
You're not guilty.

289
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,520
So, child,

290
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,640
don't be scared to come home.

291
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Guang Da.

292
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,520
All these years,

293
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,280
-life has been tough on you.
-Don't get too emotional.

294
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Don't get too emotional.

295
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,960
My son.

296
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,640
Don't get too emotional.

297
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,600
You've gone through so much.

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Mom.

299
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Lie down.

300
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,680
Mom.

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
My son.

302
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,040
Guang Da.

303
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Mom, you need to rest.

304
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,400
Mom.

305
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't get too emotional.

306
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,880
Xiao Mai.

307
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,160
Xiao Mai.

308
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Your big brother hasn't eaten yet.

309
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,600
Hurry,

310
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,320
get him something good to eat.

311
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,520
I got it, Mom.

312
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,360
I'll ask Xiao Ning

313
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,840
to take him to get some good food.

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
Xiao Ning.

315
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,320
Uncle Tang.

316
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,120
My son is back.

317
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Guang Da is back.

318
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,720
Rest well.

319
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,080
Guang Da is back.

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,320
Guang Da is back.

321
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,440
Mom, be at ease.

322
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
Sorry, Uncle Tang.

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,280
Grandma can't really think straight sometimes.

324
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,320
It's alright.

325
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
What do the doctors think?

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,720
The doctor said everything's fine.

327
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Why were you in such a rush

328
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,080
to talk to me?

329
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,760
It's nothing.

330
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,240
I was worried about Grandma,

331
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
so I came by.

332
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,480
Take good care of her.

333
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,560
I'll come find you another day.

334
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
Okay.

335
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,839
I want to finish
the old family house as soon as possible

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,520
so Grandma can move in early.

337
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm worried that she...

338
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,040
I'll contact them and ask them

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,319
to increase the manpower

340
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,079
and speed up the construction progress.

341
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,400
Thank you.

342
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,839
Don't worry.

343
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,200

Please write down

356
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,480
what we discussed today.

357
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,080
Sure.

358
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,040
Okay.

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,160
Bye.

360
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,800
Bye.

361
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,360
Later.

362
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,920
Goodbye.

363
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,800
See you.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,760
Bye.

365
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,360
Alright, we're leaving.

366
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,240
Okay.

367
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
You've been working so hard lately.

368
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,120
Want to take a day off?

369
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,080
No.

370
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,520
I don't want to miss anything.

371
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,760
I want to watch

372
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,360
the house being built little by little.

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
What are you going to do

374
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,640
with the burnt future

375
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
you've collected?

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,480
I want to transform them

377
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,480
and put them back into the house.

378
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,960
The furniture

379
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
carry the past.

380
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
They can jog Grandma's

381
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
and Aunty's memories.

382
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,000
It might make them feel better than

383
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,360
just giving them a house.

384
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
Designs filled with love

385
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
are perfect.

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
Let's go.

387
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,720
Hi, Uncle Tang.

388
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
Xiao Ning, do you have time?

389
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,680
I have something very important

390
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
to tell you.

391
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,300
(Ward one, Beds 56-58)

392
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,600
Here, have some water.

393
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,480
Thank you.

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,680
Uncle Tang.

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,800
Do you have something

396
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
to tell me?

397
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,320
During the ten years I spent in prison,

398
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
to be honest,

399
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,120
I thought about your dad every day.

400
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,760
I'm really sorry. I've failed your parents,

401
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,760
your grandma, and you.

402
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,520
Uncle Tang, you...

403
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
Your dad was framed.

404
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
That car crash ten years ago

405
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,420
wasn't an accident.

406
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,480
It was planned.

407
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,800
The person who actually embezzled public funds

408
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
was...

409
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,280
No.

410
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,080
What are you doing?

411
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,360
What's so secretive

412
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
that we have to come here to talk?

413
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
What's going on?

414
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,280
The numbers don't add up.

415
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,680
You and I are in charge

416
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,960
of this project.

417
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,760
If something goes wrong,

418
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
we'd be held responsible.

419
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,480
Don't worry.

420
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,920
No one knows about this money.

421
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
Even if someone finds out,

422
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,560
our superiors will have to be confronted with it first.

423
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,080
You mean... Xu Guo Xiang?

424
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,360
Right.

425
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
Lao Tang.

426
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,880
Can he shoulder the responsibility?

427
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,280
It's more than 10 million yuan.

428
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,960
Besides,

429
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,280
he's the department head,

430
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
but we are the ones in charge

431
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,720
of this project.

432
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,720
If something goes wrong,
we'd be the ones to take the blame.

433
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,200
Lao Tang. Tell me the truth.

434
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,440
Where did the money go?

435
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Tell me.

436
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,880
I can't tell you right now.

437
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,240
Lao Tang.

438
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,320
Being the kind of person you are,

439
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,120
you'd never do anything like this.

440
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Xu Guo Xiang must be

441
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,000
the one behind you.

442
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,840
You two are in this together.

443
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,080
Right?

444
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,000
Lao Tang, what were you thinking?

445
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,280
You're sending yourself to jail,

446
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
you know?

447
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,160
Plus, these funds

448
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,920
include the pension for

449
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,760
the retired employees.

450
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,600
If you embezzle that money,

451
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
what will they live off of?

452
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,400
How dare you do something that

453
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
tramples over your conscience?

454
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,320
As time passes by,

455
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,720
there will be serious consequences!

456
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Whatever,

457
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,160
suit yourself.

458
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,760
How much information does Jiang Guang Da have?

459
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,880
He started looking

460
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,520
for evidence a few days ago.

461
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,360
He's also the project manager.

462
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
He probably has all the

463
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,200
relevant evidence by now.

464
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,600
He...

465
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,800
He's going to report us.

466
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,280
What do we do?

467
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
Looks like we really...

468
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
have to think things through.

469
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,560
After your dad passed away,

470
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,160
we changed all the numbers.

471
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,840
Because the dead cannot give witness,

472
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
we shifted the majority

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,680
of the blame onto him

474
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,000
and I was only convicted as an accessory offender.

475
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
But being the department head,

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
Xu Guo Xiang only had to resign.

477
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,360
I'm sorry, Xiao Ning.

478
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,000
These are the accounting records...

479
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,320
I've kept from back then.

480
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,040
All the evidence

481
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,640
is in this thumb drive.

482
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,600
There's nothing I can do to make up for it.

483
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
I just want to give

484
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,400
these to you

485
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,360
and prove your dad's innocence.

486
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,800
So,

487
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,680
that car crash from ten years ago...

488
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,680
It was planned by Xu Guo Xiang

489
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,560
to make sure that the witness
will never talk again.

490
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
That car crash

491
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,400
not only killed my parents

492
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,920
but also badly injured Gu Chuan,

493
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,640
who tried to save us.

494
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,440
His life

495
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,160
has been a living hell for ten years.

496
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
No one knows

497
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
how much longer he has left.

498
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
I'm sorry, Xiao Ning.

499
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,760
It's all my fault.

500
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,560
It's all my fault.

501
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,080
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,600
It's all my fault.

504
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
It's all my fault.

505
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,040
I caused your dad's death,

506
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,960
and you lost your mom because of me.

507
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,760
What's wrong?

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,040
If I hadn't been so unlucky,

521
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
my dad wouldn't have run into

522
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
such terrible things;

523
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,960
there wouldn't have been a car crash;

524
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
my parents wouldn't have passed away;

525
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,400
you wouldn't have been injured,

526
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,480
and you wouldn't have been tortured
by the mechanical heart.

527
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,760
Now...

528
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
If it hadn't been for everything that had happened,

529
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,680
how could I have met you,

530
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,560
right?

531
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,760
But how come I'm the only one

532
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,720
who's alive and well?

533
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,200
My parents left me behind

534
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,920
and now even you are...

535
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,320
Don't leave me behind, okay?

536
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,360
What should I do?

537
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,400
I don't know what I should do.

538
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
It's okay.

539
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Stop thinking about that.

540
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,200
I've looked through the information

541
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
and the accounting records in the thumb drive.

542
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,840
It's all solid evidence.

543
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,520
You can totally prove

544
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
your dad's innocence.

545
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,040
It can also prove

546
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,400
that Xu Guo Xiang was the major offender.

547
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,280
It's Xu Cheng Ran.

548
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,960
I asked him to come.

549
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
I wanted to give him a heads-up

550
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,520
so he can be mentally prepared

551
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,560
before we call the police.

552
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,820
(Accounting records of Dongjiang Group)

553
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,239
I never would've thought that

554
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,480
it was my dad who ruined your lives.

555
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,120
He killed Xiao Ning's parents

556
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,480
and almost killed

557
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,360
my best friend.

558
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,040
I...

559
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,239
I don't know what to say.

560
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
I don't deserve to be your friend.

561
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
What are you doing?

562
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,520
Chuan.

563
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Xiao Ning.

564
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,200
Don't blame yourself.

566
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
None of these is your fault.

567
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,640
But he's my dad.

568
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,000
That's a fact that cannot be changed.

569
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880
No one will blame you.

570
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,640
This matter has nothing

571
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,520
to do with you.

572
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,720
Chuan.

573
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,200
I'd rather you scold me,

574
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,640
hit me, or whatever, right now.

575
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,680
At least,

576
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,920
I'd feel slightly better that way.

577
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,600
Don't say anything to comfort me.

578
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Ran Ran.

579
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,200
We cannot change anything

580
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,080
that has already happened.

581
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,200
Right now, we should be thinking about

582
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,120
how to solve the problem.

583
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,080
Calm down.

584
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,360
Mr. Xu.

585
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,080
You are Gu Chuan's friend,

586
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,920
Sister Yan Yan's husband,

587
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,040
and my friend.

588
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
But,

589
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,600
I cannot forgive your father

591
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,680
just because of this.

592
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,000
He still has to be

593
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
punished by law.

594
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,920
The reason we chose to

595
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,920
tell you as soon as we could

596
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,440
was for you

597
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,920
to be mentally prepared.

598
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,840
I understand.

599
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,760
I won't stop you,

600
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,800
but

601
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,440
I have a presumptuous request.

602
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,520
Ran Ran,

603
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
be reasonable.

604
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
I just want to say...

605
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,480
that he is my dad after all.

606
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,320
Could you give me a bit of time

607
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,840
to convince him

608
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,960
to turn himself in?

609
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,080
I promise

610
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,840
if he has

611
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,320
no intention to repent,

612
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,120
I'll turn him over

613
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
to the police myself.

614
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,680
What brings you back?

615
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Dad.

616
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
You killed

617
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,120
Jiang Xiao Ning's parents.

618
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
What did you say?

619
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,720
I know everything.

620
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,240
I've already seen

621
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,040
all the evidence

622
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,440
about your embezzlement back then.

623
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,040
Who told you?

624
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Jiang Xiao Ning?

625
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,920
Gu Chuan?

626
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,880
Does it matter?

627
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,840
Or are you going to kill the witnesses again?

628
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,040
Just like how you dealt with

629
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Jiang Xiao Ning's family

630
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:19,960
and Gu Chuan by hitting them off the mountain

631
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,600
all those years ago.

632
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,120
When I found out about it,

633
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,600
I felt

634
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,240
that I didn't know you anymore.

635
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,440
I don't understand.

636
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,080
How could you have done

637
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,200
something so heinous?

638
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,320
How could you be so cruel?

639
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
You not only committed embezzlement

640
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,520
but also murder, really?

641
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,040
Gu Chuan

642
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,440
and Jiang Xiao Ning,

643
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,720
are my best friends.

644
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,680
You have ruined their lives.

645
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,320
I can't face them

646
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,160
anymore.

647
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,760
Why did you do that?

648
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,720
I don't understand.

649
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,120
I don't understand

650
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,520
how my dad could be a murderer?

651
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,760
Why?

652
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,440
There is no "why".

653
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,680
Look at this house!

654
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,520
Think about the company!

655
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,800
After I die,

656
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
everything will be yours.

657
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,120
That's why!

658
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,840
Because you're my son!

659
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,000
Do you think that leaving the money,

660
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,560
this house,

661
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,440
and Reindeer Group to me

662
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
is for the best of my interest?

663
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,560
Have you thought about

664
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
what I want?

665
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I just want an unbroken family,

666
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,000
with both of you and mom in it.

667
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,720
Go turn yourself in.

668
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,880
This is the only thing

669
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,200
I can do for you right now.

670
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,200
Xu Cheng Ran.

671
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,000
You're going to send

672
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,240
your own father to prison

673
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,760
for an outsider?
