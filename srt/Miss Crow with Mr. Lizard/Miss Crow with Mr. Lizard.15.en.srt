21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,680
Boss.

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm sorry, Boss.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,760
I not only got drunk yesterday,

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,040
but also left early.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
I went to bed right after I got home.

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,840
I only checked my Wechat

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,120
when I woke up today.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm used to it.

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Are you sober now?

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
Let's go.

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Yes, Boss.

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,200
In the design proposal,

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,160
we should add some

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
features of Chinese gardens.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,680
This afternoon,

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,080
come visit a teacher with me.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,440
Okay.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,320
Just the two of us?

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,160
Yes.

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,960
We are going out of town.

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,800
We'll fly back at night.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Is there a problem?

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,400
No.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,240
No problem.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,920
Recently, you're not doing your job very well.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,680
You used to

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
buy me breakfast

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
and drinks.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,720
Now,

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,000
you just wait for me standing next to the car.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
These days,

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
I've been thinking about

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,280
the responsibilities of my position.

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,200
Did you come up with anything?

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,640
I think

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm just

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,240
a driver and a personal assistant.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
I shouldn't interfere

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
with your personal business.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
Moreover,

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,920
I always lose

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,080
interest in things quickly.

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
(Jiang Xiao Ning,)

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,280
(what the heck are you talking about?)

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,960
(You just don't know)

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,600
(how to face)

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
(your feelings for Boss.)

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
Young people nowadays are all like that.

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
They lose their passion quickly.

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
This is urgent.

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
You need to deal with it now.

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,280
Make sure it's done as soon as possible.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Leave us.

74
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Hello, Director Xu.

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,320
Director Xu,

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,440
what brings you here?

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Take a seat.

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,560
There is a small problem with money

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
from last time.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,079
Accidentally,

81
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,440
somebody involved

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
got the goods on us.

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,440
He won't

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,839
say anything, right?

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,720
No, he won't.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,920
I have seen a lot of people like him.

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,240
They only ask for money.

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
You just need to pay them with enough money.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
So I've prepared some cash.

90
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
Get it solved with Assistant Liu,

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,400
when it's time.

92
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,840
Director Xu,

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,440
is it really

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,200
not going to cause any trouble?

95
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,960
Tang Xu,

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,800
you are the kind of person

97
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
who will accomplish big things in the future.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,920
You need to be able to stay calm.

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,760
Don't panic

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,040
when nothing has happened yet.

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,400
Otherwise, how can I

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,400
leave my business to you in the future?

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,960
I understand.

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
You're seeing someone?

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Who is the lucky girl?

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,080
No... no, Director Xu.

108
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,560
It's just for a little sister.

109
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Little sister?

110
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,560
It's a good thing.

111
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,040
Why are you nervous?

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm happy for you.

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
But remember,

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
bring her around.

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,200
I'll help you find out whether she's a good girl.

116
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,680
See you.

117
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,200
Director Xu.

118
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Take care, Director Xu.

119
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
Brother Xu.

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,360
Why did you come visit me at noon?

121
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm going on a business trip in a few days.

122
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
I may be gone for

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,800
about twenty days.

124
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm a little worried about you,

125
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,600
so I came by to check on you.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,360
Oh, right.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
How's work going for you these days?

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,360
Is everything going well?

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440
No, it's not.

130
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,680
I've caused a lot of trouble

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
and always made my boss angry.

132
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,680
I see.

133
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,560
It's alright.

134
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,680
My company's door is

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,480
always open for you.

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,680
You're welcome anytime.

137
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,840
It's okay.

138
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,520
I'm just venting.

139
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
I really like

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,840
my company.

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
Look at you.

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,200
Asking you to work at my company

143
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
feels like I'm kidnapping you.

144
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
You already helped me so much.

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
I don't want to cause you more trouble.

146
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,480
Brother Xu.

147
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
You don't look well.

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Are you working too hard?

149
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
I've got too much going on recently.

150
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,120
There are too many things I need to think about.

151
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
You've been like this all these years.

152
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
You don't look happy

153
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,880
and I can't help you.

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,080
I miss the good old days.

155
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
We were so carefree back then.

156
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920
Oh right,

157
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,120
this is for you.

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,600
Your birthday is coming up in a few days.

159
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm afraid I can't make it back in time,

160
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
so I'm giving this to you in advance.

161
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,440
You know

162
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,640
I never celebrate my birthday.

163
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,840
You don't celebrate your birthday.

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
You don't buy cakes.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,240
You should at least have birthday presents.

166
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,000
Take it.

167
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Thanks, Brother Xu.

168
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm leaving soon.

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
You're not going to say goodbye to me?

170
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Have a safe trip.

171
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,320
Jiang Xiao Ning.

172
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,080
Boss.

173
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,520
When did you come down?

174
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
I just came down

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
and happened to see you.

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,000
Why are you still here?

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
If we don't leave now, we'll miss the flight.

178
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Miss the flight?

179
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Brother Xu,

180
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,160
I need to go now.

181
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,040
Thanks for your present.

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,450
(Domestic Departures)

183
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,360
(Security Check)

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello, Miss.

185
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Hello.

186
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,560
Hello.

187
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,480
This is the identification card
for my mechanical heart.

188
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Okay.

189
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,120
Thank you.

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,040
It's done.

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay, thank you.

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,760
It's sour.

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,280
Wang Kai.

194
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Where is Jiang Xiao Ning?

195
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
She's on a business trip.

196
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
A business trip to where?

197
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,040
She is on a business trip with Mr. Gu.

198
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Why do I always

199
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
see you in our Design Department?

200
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,159
What do you mean by "your" Design Department?

201
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,240
This is our company.

202
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,720
We, the Administrative Department,

203
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
need to

204
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,960
understand every department's daily lives.

205
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,640
To better serve you.

206
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,120
Serve you.

207
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Jiang Xiao Ning.

208
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,080
The suitcase.

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
What's wrong with you?

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,640
I just don't understand

211
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,080
why you're bringing me on a business trip?

212
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
What do you think?

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,400
(I hope it's because you like me,)

214
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
(but...)

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm probably the most useless person

216
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,120
in the whole company.

217
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,680
Other people have important tasks

218
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,640
to complete.

219
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,680
Jiang Xiao Ning.

220
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,520
Is there anything wrong

221
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,080
with your brain recently?

222
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
The Jiang Xiao Ning I know

223
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,760
is always positive

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
and never has low self-esteem.

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,640
Not to mention being

226
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
sarcastic in front of her boss.

227
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm sorry, Boss.

228
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,720
I have no filter.

229
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,560
I look down on myself.

230
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,120
I indulge in fantasy.

231
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
I do not engage in honest work.

232
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
This time, I'm bringing you

233
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,840
to visit

234
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,320
one of my teachers.

235
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
He is very important to me.

236
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,480
Didn't you say

237
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,280
you want to study architectural design?

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,120
I hope this visit

239
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,840
will be helpful to you.

240
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,560
Boss.

241
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,600
I think you have potential,

242
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
so I'm willing to help you.

243
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't let me down.

244
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,880
Yes, Boss.

245
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
Mr. Wang is a master of

246
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,760
Chinese garden design.

247
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
We met

248
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
when we were working

249
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,280
on the same project.

250
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,640
We found that

251
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
we clicked in many aspects,

252
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
so we became teacher and student.

253
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
However, for me,

254
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,920
we're more like close friends across generations.

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,840
In other words,

256
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,480
this place

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,920
is full of Boss's memories?

258
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

259
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
This place

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
feels familiar to me.

261
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,680
Really?

262
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Really.

263
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,280
I think I've been here before.

264
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,880
Gu Chuan.

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Mr. Wang.

266
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,400
Long time no see, Mr. Wang.

267
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,680
Yes, yes, yes.

268
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,880
I've been too busy

269
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,440
to come visit you.

270
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
I understand.

271
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
People always say that

272
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
we architects

273
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,040
have no love lives,

274
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,880
no friends,

275
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
and no families.

276
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
But...

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,240
This girl is...?

278
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Hello, Mr. Wang.

279
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm Mr. Gu's assistant.

280
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm Jiang Xiao Ning.

281
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, an assistant.

282
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,880
When Gu Chuan came to visit me before,

283
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,240
he never brought an assistant along.

284
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
You are a big boss now.

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
You now have a secretary, an assistant, and what else?

286
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
Mr. Wang.

287
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,560
When my wife heard you were coming,

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
she regretted it so much.

289
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,480
She

290
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
had just gone to Jiuzhaigou County

291
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,280
with

292
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
a bunch of her friends.

293
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,760
When she saw the video,

294
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,600
she started to complain so much.

295
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
She had already

296
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,840
planned out what good food

297
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,760
she was going to make you once you're here.

298
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,400
Would you look at this.

299
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,800
You've missed each other again.

300
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,240
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

301
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,200
I'll come visit you more often in the future.

302
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,840
Come on, let's go inside first.

303
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay.

304
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
I bought you a bunch of

305
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,680
delicious fruits.

306
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
Mr. Wang, I can help you wash the fruits.

307
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Sounds good.

308
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,600
Mr. Wang,

309
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,480
you just have some rest.

310
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,480
I've got these.

311
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Little girl,

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
you're pretty smart.

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,560
Really?

314
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,960
But when we were at the airport just now,

315
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Boss said I had become dumber.

316
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Really?

317
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
Your boss knows how to make jokes now?

318
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,760
He was very serious.

319
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
In the past, I was worried that

320
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
he may develop depression

321
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,000
or something else.

322
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,640
It seems like I was worried for nothing.

323
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,720
No way.

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,040
He scolds me every day

325
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,280
and seems to enjoy doing it.

326
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,680
I'll have a talk with him later.

327
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

328
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,560
Boss,

329
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,080
have some fruits.

330
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
What are you looking at?

331
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm just looking around.

332
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,280
I always do this every time I'm here.

333
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,200
This is me as a kid.

334
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,320
Me and my dad.

335
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,320
You're saying

336
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,520
this is your father?

337
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
Is this really you?

338
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,720
Yes.

339
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
You know my dad?

340
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
Jiang Guang Da?

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
You, you're Guang Da's daughter?

342
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,120
He was my student.

343
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,600
When he first came to the university,

344
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
I thought he had great potential.

345
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,240
I really liked him.

346
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,760
I invited him to come to my place

347
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
for meals quite often.

348
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,000
This picture was taken

349
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,240
when he came to visit

350
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
after he had graduated.

351
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
It's the only picture I have of us together.

352
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,240
Who would know...

353
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm sorry, kid.

354
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,800
I brought up your sad memories.

355
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,080
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

356
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,080
It's been many years.

357
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,800
I won't be sad anymore.

358
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,320
On the contrary,

359
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm very happy

360
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
to have met you today.

361
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,640
Mr. Wang.

362
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,760
When my dad was young,

363
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
was he handsome?

364
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,120
Yes.

365
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,800
A lot of girls were chasing after him.

366
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,480
But my mom got him at the end.

367
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Mr. Wang.

368
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,120
Is this

369
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
Boss when he was young?

370
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,480
Yes.

371
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,080
Boss.

372
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,320
Should I call you

373
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,280
Shi Shu?
[Shi means teacher, Shu means uncle]

374
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Shi Shu?

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
I have something to show you.

376
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Shi Shu.

377
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
This is the work notebook that

378
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,600
I've been using for years.

379
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
There are a lot of design drawings in it.

380
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Many of them

381
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
were completed with

382
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,600
your dad, Guang Da.

383
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,360
Since you are Guang Da's daughter,

384
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,600
I should

385
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
give this to you.

386
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Maybe it'll come in handy

387
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,720
for work in the future.

388
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,880
Mr. Wang.

389
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,080
This gift is too precious.

390
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
I can't take it.

391
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,520
You're Guang Da's daughter.

392
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
It should be yours.

393
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
I hope you will work hard

394
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,160
to become an outstanding architectural designer.

395
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,120
One that's better than Gu Chuan.

396
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,960
No, no, no.

397
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,200
Mr. Wang.

398
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,760
You're too biased.

399
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
I haven't even seen this notebook.

400
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
You're already a big boss.

401
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,720
You don't need it.

402
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
I do.

403
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,240
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

404
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I will work hard.

405
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,760
I don't dare to be compared to Boss,

406
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
but I will be as excellent

407
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,880
as my dad.

408
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,119
Of course, you will.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Come on.

410
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,480
Have some fruits.

411
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay.

412
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
Help yourself.

413
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,960
Pear?

414
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,319
Apple?

415
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,480
Both are fine.

416
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
I have some good tea too.

417
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,880
It's where it always has been. You know the place.

418
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
Ah, I see.

419
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,120
I'll go look for it.

420
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
In a bit,

421
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
ask Gu Chuan

422
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
to take you out for a walk.

423
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
The view here is gorgeous.

424
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,600
Mr. Wang.

425
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Which is my dad's handwriting?

426
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,400
Look here...

427
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
I just don't understand

428
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,120
why would Mr. Wang give the notebook

429
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
to you.

430
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
I can't help it. I'm a good person.

431
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
Boss, I'm in a good mood today.

432
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you want to eat? My treat.

433
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
Well, I'm not in a good mood.

434
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,280
If you want to buy me something,

435
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
buy me ice cream.

436
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,080
But you never eat

437
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
things that are too sweet.

438
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,960
None of your business.

439
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,840
Boss.

440
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Yours.

441
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,280
Boss,

442
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,240
maybe

443
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,160
I've been here too.

444
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,240
Doesn't it say

445
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
in the movies that

446
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,160
"all encounters

447
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,400
are reunions after a long time."

448
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,360
Think about it.

449
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
We've both been to Mr. Wang's house,

450
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
both walked this stone road,

451
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,000
both taken photos

452
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,640
in the same room.

453
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,120
Now you've become my boss

454
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,600
and we're having ice cream together.

455
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
Suddenly, I feel like the ice cream

456
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
has become special too.

457
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
Boss, what's in your mind?

458
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,240
Nothing.

459
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Why did you

460
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,760
buy this flavor?

461
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,320
This is the newest flavor.

462
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,760
Do you want to try it?

463
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
I mean...

464
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
this is the newest flavor.

465
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
Do you want to

466
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,120
smell it?

467
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,600
Nothing more.

468
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Not bad.

469
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,160
(Was that an indirect kiss?)

470
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,160
(This is so awkward.)

471
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
(What should I do?)

472
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,400
(Should I bring up some other topic?)

473
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,360
(What to chat about?)

474
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,720
Boss.

475
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
You look pretty handsome

476
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,560
in that photo of yours when you were young.

477
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Only when I was young?

478
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,320
No.

479
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
I mean.

480
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,160
When you were young,

481
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,520
there must be a lot of people who liked you.

482
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,080
Someone who fits you

483
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,920
must be talented and beautiful.

484
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,600
Born with natural beauty.

485
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
(Jiang Xiao Ning,)

486
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
(what are you saying?)

487
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,480
Chen Wen Wen

488
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
is my ex-girlfriend.

489
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,800
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

490
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,840
I've never asked.

491
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,720
Also,

492
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
I don't really care about that.

493
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,120
You don't care?

494
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,560
Fine.

495
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,960
I won't talk about it then.

496
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
But,

497
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,600
it's fine if you want to talk about it.

498
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
It's raining

499
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
and we can't leave anyway.

500
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
Chen Wen Wen and I

501
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
started dating after graduating high school.

502
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
After that,

503
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
I went to study abroad.

504
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,280
We had been managing a long-distance relationship

505
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,440
in two different countries.

506
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,280
During the summer break of my first year
in university,

507
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I came back to China.

508
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
However, something happened

509
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,400
and we broke up.

510
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,520
After that,

511
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
we've never contacted each other.

512
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,480
It never occurred to me that

513
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
you would bring her to the office.

514
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,920
(Yes.)

515
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,840
(It's my fault.)

516
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
(It's all my fault.)

517
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
(I'm a crow)

518
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,120
(who always brings misfortune.)

519
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
But it's fine.

520
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
I consider it

521
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,000
has come to a full stop.

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,320
A full stop?

523
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Isn't it a comma?

524
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,480
Or an ellipsis?

525
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
I mean

526
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,760
who would be willing to have a full stop

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,160
with someone like you who shines this brightly.

528
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Jiang Xiao Ning.

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,760
I just realized that

530
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,000
your flattering skills are really

531
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,680
much better than any other people.

532
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,080
I won't decline

533
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
this honor.

534
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,120
Boss.

535
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,360
There's a cat.

536
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Hold this for me.

537
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,880
Come on.

538
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
It's so cute.

539
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,880
Baby.

540
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,840
Boss.

541
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,960
It's so cute.

542
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,520
Do you want to pet it?

543
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
No.

544
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,560
I don't like animals that shed.

545
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,000
Trust me, pet it.

546
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,200
You'll fall in love with it.

547
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,080
Just pet it once.

548
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,680
Come on.

549
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,720
How do you feel?

550
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,840
Isn't its hair so silky?

551
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
What does it mean when

552
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,640
it looks at me in this way?

553
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
It likes you.

554
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,400
It knows that following the right owner

555
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
will allow it to eat well.

556
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,240
It doesn't have an owner.

557
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
It looks like it's

558
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,040
a stray cat.

559
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,600
Boss.

560
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,840
Why don't we take it back

561
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
and adopt it?

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,040
Adopt it?

563
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,840
Boss.

564
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,960
Look at you.

565
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
You're handsome, talented,

566
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,240
and kind.

567
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,960
Moreover,

568
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,200
your apartment is spacious.

569
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
If I bring it back,

570
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,400
I won't have time to take care of it

571
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,600
since my grandma and aunt are not in good health.

572
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,400
Boss.

573
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Well.

574
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
Let me think about it.

575
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay.

576
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,200
If you're thinking about it,

577
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,440
I need to make it clear.

578
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,520
If you adopt it,

579
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,800
you can't abandon it.

580
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
You should feed it good food,

581
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,880
bathe it,

582
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,240
be responsible for it.

583
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
Otherwise, you shouldn't adopt it.

584
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,240
If it knows how good

585
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,520
it feels to be taken care of by an owner,

586
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,520
it won't be able to revert back
to its current lifestyle.

587
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,360
Temporarily.

588
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,000
It can stay at my place temporarily.

589
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
Then can I go visit it frequently

590
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,720
at your place?

591
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,080
Of course you need to come visit.

592
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
Otherwise, am I supposed to raise it by myself?

593
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,640
Great.

594
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,720
Thank you, Boss.

595
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,560
Should we give it

596
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,640
a name?

597
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
Look,

598
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,800
your last name is Gu and my last name is Jiang.

599
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,960
Gu Gu?

600
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,360
Jiang Jiang?

601
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
These names don't work.

602
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,840
We can call it Ice Cream.

603
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,120
We ran into it

604
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,280
while we were having ice cream.

605
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,040
Why don't we call it Ice Cream?

606
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Okay.

607
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,760
From now on,

608
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,720
your name will be Ice Cream.

609
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Ice Cream, Ice Cream.

610
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,520
Boss.

611
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
Give it some ice cream.

612
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
See if it'll have any.

613
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
Feed it.

614
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,760
Come on.

615
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,240
Come on.

616
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,000
Do you want to have any?

617
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,680
How about this one?

618
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,400
You can choose.

619
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
You should behave, understand?

620
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,760
Adapting to

621
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,200
the environment is basic.

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,320
Don't think I can't hold you accountable

623
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
even though you look cute.

624
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,040
If you want to stay at my place,

625
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,560
you must have a bath.

626
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,760
Come here.

627
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,120
I asked you to come here.

628
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,160
You're smart.

629
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,840
You know this is the bathroom.

630
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,360
Come, come, come.

631
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,120
From now on,

632
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,800
here is where

633
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,320
you take baths.

634
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
(Ice Cream is so cute.)

635
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,720
(I feel happy when I see you.)

636
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,680
(But what makes me happier)

637
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
(is being able to)

638
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
(visit you at Boss' place often.)

639
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,620
(Miss Crow and Mr. Lizard.)

640
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,200
(Miss Crow and Mr. Lizard.)

641
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,160
Boss.

642
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,200
Suddenly behaving so well.

643
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
I hope you won't lose your passion too fast.

644
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,480
Thank you, Boss.

645
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
I'll try to keep it up.

646
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
If there's nothing else,

647
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,320
I'll go back to

648
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
keep reading Mr. Wang's notes.

649
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,400
Okay.

650
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,760
When you're done with it, let me take a look at it too.

651
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,000
Boss,

652
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,960
I really do want to let you have a look at it.

653
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
However,

654
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,880
this is Mr. Wang's private belongings.

655
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
It's not good to pass it around.

656
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,840
I noticed that

657
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,280
after we came back from the business trip,

658
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
you've become more and more bold.

659
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,480
Mr. Gu.

660
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,640
Xiao Ning is here too.

661
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,080
I was just looking for you.

662
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,520
This is a critical period for the art gallery.

663
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
I'm needed at the site quite frequently.

664
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,360
I'm afraid I won't have time for

665
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,240
Chen Wen Wen's exhibition.

666
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,480
Why don't you let Cheng Dong take charge of it?

667
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,680
Cheng Dong has his own projects

668
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,720
to complete.

669
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm not quitting.

670
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm just asking for

671
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,600
an assistant.

672
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Who do you think is suitable for the job?

673
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,640
After careful consideration,

674
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,360
I can only borrow your assistant.

675
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,640
I think this is a great

676
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
learning opportunity.

677
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
I'm afraid I'm not capable of

678
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,960
taking on this role.

679
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,000
You can practice your skills.

680
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,920
Okay.

681
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,440
Thank you, Boss,

682
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
for giving me this opportunity.

683
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,760
Sister Man Lin.

684
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,880
Should I contact

685
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,600
Sister Wen Wen for anything?

686
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,320
Take it easy.

687
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,840
I'll let you know in advance.

688
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,080
Jing Xiao Ning.

689
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,080
You've got this.

690
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,920
Mine is good too.

691
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,520
Really?

692
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,520
I'm going to try some.

693
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,800
Why did that just feel like

694
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
a martial arts film?

695
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,840
I think

696
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,000
something big is about to happen
in the martial arts world.

697
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,000
A reign of terror is inevitable.

698
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,520
No matter what happens,

699
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,440
no matter how many years have passed,

700
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
no matter who the leader is,

701
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,880
I only follow my own path.

702
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,760
This hero, would you mind me asking you

703
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
what path?

704
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,680
The path in your heart.

705
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,080
You can't walk the path in my heart.

706
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,120
To you, there will always be road traffic control.

707
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,600
Why?

708
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,560
Look,

709
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,480
you're Empress Dowager.

710
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,400
I'm Commander Ju.

711
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,840
Even our snacks

712
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,040
look like a couple.

713
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,080
We were born for

714
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,840
each other.

715
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,600
We'll talk once you've become extremely rich.

716
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,400
Can you not act like this?

717
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
What did I do?

718
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,680
Why are you discouraging me?

719
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,360
Is Gu Chuan in his office?

720
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,360
Yes, yes, yes.

721
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
Jia Jia, Jia Jia, Jia Jia.

722
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,360
Jia Jia, don't think about it.

723
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,600
All the girls in this building

724
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,400
want to marry him.

725
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,560
There are too many wolves and too little meat.

726
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,560
Nothing is impossible.

727
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
Why leave me hanging?

728
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,640
My Chuan.

729
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Who bought this for you?

730
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,320
It doesn't look delicious at all.

731
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,720
I bought you

732
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,360
fresh-from-the-oven cakes

733
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,560
and it's your favorite flavor,

734
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,400
vanilla.

735
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,520
When did I start liking

736
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,240
vanilla?

737
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,800
You don't?

738
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,600
It's not important.

739
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
These are fresh from the oven,

740
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,720
way more delicious than this,

741
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,000
which clearly looks stale.

742
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,200
Do you have a favor to ask me?

743
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,920
Hey,

744
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,440
do I need a reason to come

745
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
visit my Chuan?

746
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,840
Me buying cake for you.

747
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
Isn't it normal?

748
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,400
Of course,

749
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,160
there is a small favor I'd like to ask.

750
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
Get to the point.

751
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I want to borrow someone from you.

752
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,560
Borrow a person?

753
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,000
What's with today?

754
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,640
Why is everyone asking to borrow people from me
this morning?

755
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,720
Other people asked to borrow people from you too?

756
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
But the person I'm asking to borrow

757
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,640
shouldn't be

758
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
very important to you.

759
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,120
Who is it?

760
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,680
How are we supposed to work?

761
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,120
Meng Jia.

762
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,720
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

763
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,600
I thought I just saw a ghost.

764
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Well.

765
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,320
Be my girlfriend.

766
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,640
Be your girlfriend?

767
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,640
Come with me.

768
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,800
Get on with your work.

769
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,520
Do your work. Nothing is happening here.

770
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,880
Today...

771
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,520
Brother Kai.

772
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
Brother Kai. What's the matter?

773
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,680
Brother Kai.

774
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,520
Mr... Mr. Cheng.

775
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,720
Brother Kai.

776
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,440
Brother Kai.

777
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,120
Mr. Xu.

778
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,760
I'm not

779
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,800
ready for this.

780
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,520
This is too sudden.

781
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,160
Calm down.

782
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,480
I'll explain everything to you.

783
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,240
Don't touch me.

784
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
What...

785
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Give me three seconds to calm down first.

786
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,640
I can do this.

787
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,480
Mr. Xu.

788
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,560
Although I'm not fully

789
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
prepared,

790
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,520
go ahead and say it.

791
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Look.

792
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,720
Can I...

793
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,280
You can.

794
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,840
Can you...

795
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,640
I can.

796
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,960
Wait until I finish my sentence.

797
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
Can I

798
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,440
ask you

799
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
to pretend to be my girlfriend?

800
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,760
Pretend?

801
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,600
It's fake?

802
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,000
It's fake.

803
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,840
I know it's not good

804
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,440
to ask anyone to do this.

805
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,360
At least you are

806
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
the company's employee

807
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,520
and we've known each other for a while.

808
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,360
I also

809
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,080
believe that you can play the role well.

810
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,760
Right?

811
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,240
I can make

812
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,200
our fake relationship look real.

813
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,920
Let's start with

814
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
the first ploy of the play.

815
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,360
We'll start with

816
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,239
how the role and the actor should...

817
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,040
Okay, okay, okay.

818
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,520
We can talk about it next time.

819
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,400
So...

820
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,440
you're in?

821
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,159
I am.

822
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,440
Great.

823
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,840
Do you need me to

824
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,040
prepare any costumes

825
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,800
or props?

826
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,480
No.

827
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,360
I have everything.

828
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
You do?

829
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,960
I do!

830
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,760
I'll ask Gu Chuan

831
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
to assign you less work later.

832
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,159
Thank you

833
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,880
in advance.

834
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,840
No problem.

835
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm more than willing to do so.

836
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,400
I won't waste too much of your time.

837
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I need about

838
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,400
two episodes.

839
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
Two episodes?

840
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,159
I can

841
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,520
do more.

842
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,320
We can discuss this later.

843
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,360
You need to go out with me

844
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,480
this afternoon.

845
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,920
I've got you on leave.

846
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,719
Go get ready.

847
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,480
I'll wait for you downstairs.

848
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
No problem.

849
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,159
Fake.

850
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,520
I forgot to talk about the pay.

851
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,880
Not important.

852
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,520
Not important, not important.

853
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,640
Brother Kai.

854
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,360
What's wrong with you?

855
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,240
You've been

856
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,720
lost in thought for a while.

857
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Get up. It's my seat.

858
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,840
What's actually going on?

859
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,120
Someone's life is at risk.

860
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,800
Mr. Xu asked me

861
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,680
to pretend to be his girlfriend.

862
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,240
I finally have a chance to get into acting.

863
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,360
Really?

864
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,880
Really.

865
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,200
So it's actually fake?

866
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,040
It's fake.

867
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Yes!

868
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,400
Yes!

869
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,680
I knew Mr. Xu couldn't be

870
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
this blind.

871
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,760
No, no, no.

872
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,600
A slip of the tongue.

873
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,920
He has sharp eyes.

874
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,040
Great taste.

875
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,600
You're good now?

876
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm good, I'm good.

877
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,600
Are you alright?

878
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,160
Go back to work.

879
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,640
It's fine, it's fine.

880
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,200
Everything is fine.

881
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,320
Go back to work.

882
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,680
Let me tell you.

883
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
Don't be so happy this early.

884
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,600
What did I say?

885
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Everything is...

886
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,600
Impossible.

887
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,040
Impossible.

888
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,240
Come on, come on, come on.

889
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,320
Come on, come on, come on.

890
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,640
Eat, eat, eat.

891
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,240
This, this, this.

892
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,640
Pretending to be his girlfriend.

893
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,800
Sister Yan Yan has met her match.

894
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,080
Manger Wei.

895
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,480
Please sign this.

896
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,960
Did you review it?

897
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,960
Yes, there are no issues.

898
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Wait until I have time.

899
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,080
Manager Wei,

900
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
are you busy right now?

901
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,560
Did you knock?

902
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,960
If you're in a rush,

903
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,600
go ask your boyfriend

904
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
who acted crazy after getting drunk

905
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,760
to sign it for you.

906
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,400
He's not my boyfriend.

907
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,200
And it was our fault

908
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,120
last time.

909
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
My apologies.

910
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,480
This is going to benefit our company.

911
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,320
Thank you.

912
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,680
Zhao Yan.

913
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,680
Let's go have lunch together.

914
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm on a diet.

915
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,440
So aggressive.

916
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
If she doesn't want to go, let's go together.

917
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Cool, let's go.

918
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Your treat?

919
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,080
Do you want us to bring you some food?

920
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,400
Zhao Yan?

921
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,440
Zhao Yan?

922
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,280
Just leave her alone.

923
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,960
Let's go.

924
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,680
Let's go.

925
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,240
Yan Yan.

926
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,440
What a coincidence.

927
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,760
What a coincidence.

928
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,000
Were you waiting for me?

929
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,600
I just got here.

930
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,840
I was just passing by. It was a coincidence.

931
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,880
So you like acting?

932
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
Let me tell you about acting.

933
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,720
Hello.

934
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,760
Iced Americano, thank you.

935
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,400
Okay.

936
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,120
It tells you about the rhythms in performance.

937
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,040
Do you know the categories

938
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,640
of rhythms in performance?

939
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
Internal rhythm and external rhythm,

940
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,800
and the relationship between internal rhythm
and external rhythm.

941
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,120
Don't you think it's amazing?

942
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
Guess what internal rhythm is.

943
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,640
Your lipstick.

944
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,200
Oh?

945
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,080
Is it ready?

946
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,160
It's ready.

947
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,880
Your coffee.

948
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,680
Thank you.

949
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,120
That's the girl?

950
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
She doesn't seem to be better than me.

951
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,240
Alright.

952
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
Today's work is done.

953
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,040
We're done?

954
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,200
I haven't even started to act.

955
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,640
I...

956
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,120
I changed into a dress for this.

957
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,160
Mr. Xu,

958
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
let's do it again.

959
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,760
I'll do better.

960
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,360
Next time.

961
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,440
We'll have other opportunities.

962
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
Do we have other opportunities?

963
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,560
There is no next time.

964
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,160
Today's work is done.

965
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,640
Let's go.

966
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,480
I'll walk you back.

967
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,680
Mr. Xu.

968
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,360
Mr. Xu.

969
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,560
Boss.

970
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,480
I'll leave first.

971
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,280
Are you going to leave just like that?

972
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
I'll pick you up on time tomorrow.

973
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,720
Do you want to

974
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,840
go up and visit Ice Cream?

975
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,080
It has been having a poor appetite recently.

976
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,680
I don't know why.

977
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,560
How can it have a poor appetite?

978
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,560
What did you feed it?

979
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,880
I don't know

980
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,240
what I gave it.

981
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,600
I'll go take a look.

982
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,480
Ice Cream.

983
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,280
Ice Cream.

984
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,120
Come.

985
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,800
How come you have a poor appetite?

986
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,760
Having a poor appetite while gaining weight?

987
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
It looks chubbier.

988
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Did it become chubbier?

989
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
I was busy revising design drawings.

990
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,520
I didn't see it eat.

991
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,480
You didn't see it eating

992
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,000
doesn't mean it didn't eat.

993
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,000
I see.

994
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,640
Its fur is so soft. Feels so nice.

995
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,920
It also smells good.

996
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080
Of course.

997
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,440
I bathe it every day.

998
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,280
Cats can't take bath every day.

999
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
How can it come onto the couch
without being bathed?

1000
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,440
How can it come into my bed
without being bathed?

1001
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,200
Ice Cream.

1002
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
Rooming with him

1003
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
must be hard for you.

1004
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,080
How come it's hard for it?

1005
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,680
It's hard for me.

1006
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,520
Okay, okay, okay.

1007
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,120
Boss, you also worked hard.

1008
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,800
Let me tell you.

1009
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,920
I didn't treat your VIP

1010
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,960
poorly.

1011
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,080
I prepared a room

1012
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,320
only

1013
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,120
for it.

1014
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,800
How nice!

1015
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,400
I want to see it.

1016
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,240
Let's go.

1017
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Ice Cream, you're so happy.

1018
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,360
This is too luxurious.

1019
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,440
Some other stuff is on the way.

1020
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,840
These are all based on my drawings.

1021
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,400
I also bought some small furniture

1022
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
for Ice Cream.

1023
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,360
I have a question.

1024
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,600
Why are all its toys

1025
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,960
pink?

1026
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,520
Don't girls like pink?

1027
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,440
Don't you like pink?

1028
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,440
But Ice Cream is a boy.

1029
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,960
You bought pink stuff when

1030
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,880
you don't even know its sex.

1031
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,000
Are you sure?

1032
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,680
Isn't... isn't it...

1033
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,080
At least they look cute.

1034
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Ice Cream.

1035
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Ice Cream.

1036
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,000
Ice Cream.

1037
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,400
Why are you so lazy?

1038
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,920
Come on, come on, come on.

1039
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,800
Hello?

1040
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,880
Hello.

1041
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,400
Is that Mr. Gu Chuan?

1042
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,400
Yes.

1043
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,880
I'm the person in charge of

1044
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
the Jin An Award in the Greater China region.

1045
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,520
Did you see

1046
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,520
our email?

1047
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,080
Email?

1048
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,120
Let me take a look now.

1049
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,960
(*"Jin" means "Golden", "An" means "Shore")

1050
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,160
Mr. Gu?

1051
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,400
Mr. Gu, are you there?

1052
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,200
Yes, I am.

1053
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,400
I just finished

1054
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
reading the email you sent.

1055
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,440
Congratulations

1056
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,580
on winning the Annual Design Award
of the Jin An Award.

1057
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,400
Pardon me,

1058
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,360
I have a question.

1059
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,520
This design is from

1060
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,400
three years ago,

1061
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,080
so...

1062
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,200
is it possible that you guys made a mistake?

1063
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,920
Because that project

1064
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,120
has only been completed this year,

1065
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,600
it is still

1066
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,360
on our nominees list for this year.

1067
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,680
We have already sent out

1068
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,200
the official notice and

1069
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,080
the awards ceremony invitation.

1070
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,720
You should be receiving them shortly.

1071
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,080
I called to

1072
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,320
congratulate you

1073
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,240
and also

1074
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,240
to confirm

1075
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,480
whether you will be able to

1076
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
attend the awards ceremony.

1077
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,760
Mr. Gu,

1078
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,520
will you be able to attend the ceremony?

1079
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,640
Yes.

1080
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,720
Great.

1081
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,840
Congratulations again.

1082
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,920
Our staff

1083
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,800
will be in contact with you shortly

1084
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,400
to confirm

1085
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,600
the details of the awards ceremony with you.

1086
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,480
I won't bother you any longer.

1087
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,200
Goodbye.

1088
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,960
Goodbye.
