You were born to be bad luck for your bosses.

Not really,

156
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
I was just born unlucky.

157
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,000

I…

159
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,720
I was just joking.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,760

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,320
Sir, sir.

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
All our items are free,

180
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
no need to pay.

181
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,640
Sir, s…

182
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Store closing, all items are free.

183
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,040
Store closing, all items are free.

184
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
Welcome.

185
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,040
All items are free.

186
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,560
Hurry up!

187
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,280
We only have three minutes left.

188
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,600
Hurry!

189
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
Mr. Gu wants

190
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
Hao Jing Hua Yuan's proposal

191
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
and the demonstration video completed today.

192
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,480
Remember,

193
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,720
make sure to double-check the page
numbers and content.

194
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
No mistakes allowed.

195
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,360
Lastly, confirm the participants of the meeting.

196
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,400
The report has been uploaded
to the meeting mailbox.

197
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,160
Make sure to avoid wasting time

198
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,440
searching through the report

199
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,560
during the meeting.

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,920
Last week's meeting minutes

201
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
(Print)
must be printed out

202
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,760
and bound.

203
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:51,100
(Chuan Design Studios)

204
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,720
What?

205
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,280
Can't you guys just play along?

206
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,720
Great work, everyone!

207
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,560
Give yourselves a pat on the back.

208
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll give you guys bonuses.

209
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Forget the bonus.

210
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,320
You should cash in the 300 rounds of coffee

211
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,960
that you promised everyone first, right?

212
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
I've been so busy lately.

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
I forgot.

214
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
Right, great wits have short memories.

215
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,040
What?

216
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,200
What brings our big investor

217
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
here today?

218
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,080
Supervision?

219
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,920
I wouldn't dare.

220
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
You're all my precious cash cows.

221
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,160
I was just

222
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,000
passing by,

223
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
thought I'd feed

224
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,320
my precious cash cows.

225
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,480
Where is my Chuan?

226
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,560
Is he here?

227
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Sir,

228
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,280
just look at our surroundings.

229
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,000
Mountains and rivers nearby, south-facing.

230
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,200
Definitely great Feng Shui.

231
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,640
We are

232
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,760
the best in the city

233
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,160
and there are many choices

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,360
in terms of building specifications,

235
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
covering consumers at various income levels.

236
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
Please be careful.

237
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
Sir. May I ask

238
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
who this is for?

239
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,600
So I can give my recommendations accordingly.

240
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
For myself.

241
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,920
Oh no.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Sir.

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
That's an unlucky joke to make

244
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,280
in broad daylight.

245
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
You're scaring me.

246
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,840
Why can't I buy one for myself?

247
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Of course, you can't.

248
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
It's written in the rules that

249
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
the cemetery plots are for those
who have passed away.

250
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
This is a legit business.

251
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,040
Also, to buy a cemetery plot,

252
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,920
you'll need certain documentation,

253
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,200
such as death certificates.

254
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,160
Fire, fire...

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm not joking.

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,640
I'll have the documents ready soon enough.

257
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,720
This…

258
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,360
Thank goodness it's broad daylight.

259
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,120
Hello?

260
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Not at work during work hours,

261
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,600
where did you go?

262
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
What's so important?

263
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
It's a private matter.

264
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,360
Private matter?

265
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,480
There are private matters

266
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
between you and me?

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,840
I'm heartbroken.

268
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Get to the point.

269
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
That would be

270
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,960
the Hi Resorts project.

271
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm meeting the person in charge of the first party,

272
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,720
He Sheng.

273
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,600
We're meeting up in the evening to get connected.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know that

275
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,720
I never socialize with clients.

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,680
Don't worry, I won't make you drink.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,720
You're the chief

278
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,240
architect of this project after all.

279
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,200
Your attendance

280
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
would show that we respect the first party.

281
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,360
It's not respectful enough

282
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
that you, our investor, are going?

283
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,240
Aren't you planning to

284
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
win the Jin An Award with this project?

285
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
You don't want to win the big three awards?

286
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,960
Alright.

287
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,880
I'll send you the address later.

288
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,160
Come pick me up.

289
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Man Lin,

290
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,120
he hung up on me.

291
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,680
I'm the one who cares about him the most

292
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,920
in this world.

293
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,680
Whatever he wants to do,

294
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm with him.

295
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,320
When he's happy,

296
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
I'm happy too;

297
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,560
when he's not,

298
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,120
I cheer him up.

299
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,240
And he hung up on me?

300
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,240
Why?

301
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
It's between the two of you,

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
what can I say?

303
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,920
Miss Su,

304
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
interviews are taking place
in the conference room.

305
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,720
What interview?

307
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,640
An assistant for Mr. Gu.

308
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,040
He needs an assistant?

309
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,760
Doesn't he need an assistant?

310
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,960
He does.

311
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,640
He has so much work to do every day.

312
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,600
He needs an assistant

313
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,280
to deal with trivial matters.

314
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,319
He does.

315
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,400
He does.

316
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,920
Mr. Gu,

317
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
are you satisfied?

318
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,319
The location is good,

319
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
but I don't like the design.

320
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,480
But all our plots

321
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
have the same design.

322
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,800
I will design

323
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
my cemetery plot myself.

324
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,040
Then…

325
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,280
Then, let's discuss this

326
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,600
at a later time.

327
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,960
But you're alive.

328
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,680
I don't mean anything else by that.

329
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm just saying that you're alive

330
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
and so young.

331
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,840
We cannot sell cemetery plots

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,280
to a living person.

333
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
The required documents

334
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,720
should be ready

335
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,520
pretty soon.

336
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Ah, I see…

337
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,620
(Notification of outstanding water bill)

338
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,400
Unlocked.

339
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm back!

340
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,520
Granny, you're watching TV?

341
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
You're home early today.

342
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm done.

343
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
The bakery closed down.

344
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
Let me think…

345
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,000
your previous job lasted

346
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,960
five days.

347
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
This time, let me count…

348
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,480
around half a month.

349
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
That's an improvement.

350
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Our family's way of encouraging people

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,800
is always so unique.

352
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Like the old saying goes…

353
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,760
What is it again?

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,480
When God closes a door,

355
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,360
he opens a window.

356
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,960
Right?

357
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,320
In our family's case,

358
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,200
I think

359
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
God has closed the windows,

360
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,840
the doors,

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
and the sewage pipes

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
altogether.

363
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Even if the God of Fortune

364
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,280
has found

365
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,400
our address,

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,880
he just can't get in.

367
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Don't lose heart.

368
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
I'll find a new job tomorrow.

369
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,920
Do you believe me?

370
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes.

371
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
What else can I do?

372
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Ah, my back.

373
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,400
If this was before,

374
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,440
your aunt, I

375
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,800
can do everything.

376
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,160
But, ever since

377
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,040
my lower back had gone bad,

378
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
I don't have enough strength.

379
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,160
This time it's not so bad.

380
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,440
In my bad luck this time,

381
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,960
there is a glimmer of hope.

382
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
I got paid.

383
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Really?

384
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,480
This boss is a good person.

385
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,560
God bless him.

386
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I said so already.

387
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Grandma,

388
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,080
watching home shopping again?

389
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
I want to buy this.

390
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
Your aunt says it's too expensive and won't let me.

391
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Buy it anyway.

392
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
When I get paid for my part-time job
as a designated driver,

393
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,360
I'll buy you anything you want.

394
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,360
Okay.

395
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,320
How about helping your aunt

396
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,800
replace

397
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,600
the refrigerator

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,560
and the TV?

399
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,120
Sure.

400
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,240
Let's get new ones.

401
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:47,880
Great.

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
Also, buy a lobster

403
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,960
for aunty.

404
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,400
A lobster I can do.

405
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
Crayfish.

406
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,160
Abalone.

407
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,120
Yes to the abalone.

408
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Vegetarian abalone.

409
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,520
Alright, alright.

410
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,320
Stop joking around, you two.

411
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,240
Go wash your hands with your grandma.

412
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,800
Let's eat.

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
Let's eat, grandma.

414
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Time to eat.

415
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
Make sure to wash your hands properly.

416
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Time to eat.

417
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,440
Why does this taste so good?

418
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,000
Aunty.

419
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Put abalone in it.

420
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,440
No wonder.

421
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
I just went to view a cemetery plot,

422
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
thought it was pretty nice.

423
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
No need to report to me.

424
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,440
I just want to

425
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,160
complete my plan

426
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,520
as soon as possible,

427
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,640
in this limited amount of time that I have.

428
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,960
Why haven't you given up

429
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,520
on your plan of

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
winning the three big awards of architecture

431
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,440
and dying

432
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
without taking anything?

433
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,880
It's true.

434
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,280
People can't take anything with them when they die.

435
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
But,

436
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,560
if I can

437
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,680
leave something behind

438
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,080
before I die,

439
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,320
people would know that

440
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
someone named Gu Chuan had lived in this world.

441
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
That'd be nice.

442
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
My Chuan…

443
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
How about I turn the car around

444
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
and not go to the office?

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
I'd rather you not win any awards.

446
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
You want me to leave this world

447
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,360
filled with regret?

448
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,280
How about taking me with you?

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Oh right.

450
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
Su Man Lin is hiring an assistant for you.

451
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,920
I don't need an assistant.

452
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,400
That's what I said.

453
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,760
But I've changed my mind.

454
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,640
You do need one. I need one more than you do.

455
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
I need someone

456
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,840
to be there for you

457
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,840
when I can't.

458
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,880
Not going to give you

459
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,000
any chance to carry out your nonsense plan.

460
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,080
You're afraid that

461
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
I'll disturb you when you're

462
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,080
with your many girlfriends,

463
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,760
right?

464
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Chuan,

465
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
you need to have hope in life,

466
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
have faith in Dr. Peer.

467
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,920
Regardless,

468
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,200
I have to get someone to watch over you.

469
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
If something were to happen to you,

470
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
it would weigh on my conscience.

471
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
Right…

472
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,280
You have a heart,

473
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
I don't.

474
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,600
Two hundred and sixty-eight thousand yuan left

475
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,560
to save 300,000.

476
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,200
One thousand yuan, income from the bakery.

477
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,880
Paid the water bill.

478
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
Two hundred and sixty-seven thousand,

479
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,520
two hundred and twenty-eight yuan left

480
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,520
to be saved.

481
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,960
(Time for Miss Designated Driver to get to work.)

482
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,520
Jiang Xiao Ning,

483
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,440
let's go!

484
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,720
Mr. Gu.

485
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,720
Mr. Gu.

486
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,320
Mr. Gu,

487
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
please sign here.

488
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,320
Thank you.

489
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,560
Mr. Gu.

490
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
The weekly project summary

491
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,040
and client feedback

492
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
have been organized

493
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,720
and placed on your desk.

494
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,600
You shouldn't have to do this.

495
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,640
You should focus on

496
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,120
your design plans.

497
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Yes.

498
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,120
So, you need an assistant.

499
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,160
This way, you won't have to trouble

500
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,280
Director Su.

501
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,040
It's okay, I can do it.

502
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,200
Xu Cheng Ran says

503
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
you're hiring an assistant for me.

504
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,240
I don't need an assistant whatsoever.

505
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,840
What do you mean you don't?

506
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
You do and you need one as soon as possible.

507
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,240
Go work on your designs.

508
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,760
Director Su, a word, please.

509
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,120
What do you need to say behind Mr. Gu's back?

510
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
Hire him an assistant as soon as possible.

511
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,720
Find someone

512
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,600
who can look after him 24/7.

513
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,920
What is it?

514
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,720
Why 24/7?

515
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,680
I can't say much.

516
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,480
Just find him someone

517
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
as soon as possible.

518
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,560
But Mr. Gu has to agree to it.

519
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,880
His opinion doesn't matter.

520
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,400
As long as you agree and I agree.

521
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,280
Hold on…

522
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
I have something to deal with.

523
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,720
Just hurry it up.

524
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,680
Money is not an issue.

525
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
This is very important.

526
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,200
Please.

527
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,120
Hello?

528
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,840
Yes, I'm coming.

529
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,340
(A Hundred Things To Do:
Pick a cemetery plot for myself.)

530
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,840
(Win the Jin An Award.)

531
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,560
(Win the Jin An Award.)
People can't take anything with them when they die.

532
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,260
(Win the Jin An Award)

533
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,440
But,

534
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,240
if I can

535
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,360
leave something behind

536
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,800
before I die,

537
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
people would know that

538
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,120
someone named Gu Chuan had lived in this world.

539
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800
That'd be nice.

540
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Come on.

541
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,400
I'll do it myself.

542
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,960
Miss Su.

543
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,800
Mr. He. Mr. He.

544
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
Miss Su has had too much already.

545
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
Why don't we drink together instead?

546
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,440
One can never drink too much with a confidant.

547
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,560
No…

548
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,960
How are we confidants?

549
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
A confidante would have to be

550
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
someone like Miss Su.

551
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
A companion is called

552
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,320
a companion for a reason.

553
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
Right? Miss Su?

554
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,680
Come on.

555
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,720
One more.

556
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,480
Alright?

557
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,280
Let's do

558
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,520
one more round.

559
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
Mr. He,

560
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,520
your companion is down,

561
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,040
let your confidant take over.

562
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,520
Bottoms up.

563
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,640
Let me take a call.

564
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Chuan,

565
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,080
you're here? I'll come get you.

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,160
Mr. He, Gu Chuan is here.

567
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,880
He just finished work.

568
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm going to go get him.

569
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,840
We'll continue once I'm back.

570
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
How did we

571
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,440
end up here?

572
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,120
Mr. He,

573
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,800
you win.

574
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,760
I admit defeat.

575
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,880
Already?

576
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,120
I've just barely started.

577
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,920
We have to keep on drinking.

578
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,960
How about

579
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
we go

580
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,520
somewhere else?

581
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
Mr. He, stop it.

582
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,600
No more drinking.

583
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,440
Let's go

584
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,080
to a different place?

585
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,640
Would the two of you like to go to another place?

586
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Do you need a designated driver?

587
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,200
Waiter!

588
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
Waiter!

589
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,520
What's going on?

590
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,000
What is it?

591
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:35,960
How can you

592
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,800
let just anyone

593
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,880
into your place?

594
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
You're hopeless.

595
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,760
This is just a misunderstanding.

596
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,480
I came in to use the restroom

597
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,840
and happened to see the two of you

598
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,280
having trouble going back to where you were.

599
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,960
Waiter.

600
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,280
This gentleman has had a lot to drink.

601
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,080
Please help him.

602
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,920
I'll help the lady.

603
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,360
Let's go.

604
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
Which private room again?

605
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
M M02

606
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
Okay, M02.

607
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,480
Let's go. Be careful.

608
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,280
Careful, careful.

609
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Careful, careful, careful.

610
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,840
Come on.

611
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
Careful, careful, careful.

612
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,960
Sir, let me help you.

613
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,840
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

614
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,800
Girl, let me tell you.

615
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,120
You have to be careful

616
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,480
at a karaoke place like this.

617
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,800
Don't drink too much.

618
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
There are many perverts here.

619
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,320
Slowly, slowly.

620
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,600
Careful, careful, careful.

621
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
Do you feel sick?

622
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

623
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
Over here, over here, over here.

624
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,560
Be careful.

625
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,160
Sit.

626
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,680
Come, sit down, sit down.

627
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,560
Good.

628
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll have the waiter

629
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
bring you some hot water later.

630
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,520
(Xiao Ning)
This is my name card.

631
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Remember to call me

632
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,480
if you need anything.

633
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,080
Or you can find me at the front doors.

634
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
It's better to have female drivers.

635
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,280
Safety first.

636
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,560
You know what I mean.

637
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,160
Thank you for earlier.

638
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,120
You're welcome.

639
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,800
They don't let designated drivers inside.

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,960
They're scared we'll ruin the fun.

641
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,760
I'll be outside.

642
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,400
Remember to call

643
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,840
if you need me later.

644
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,600
Stay safe.

645
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,680
Don't drink too much.

646
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't drink too much of these.

647
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Stay safe.

648
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,540
(Xiao Ning)

649
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,020
(Designated driver)

650
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,480
Who are you?

651
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,640
You were pretty fast in helping her.

652
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,040
You seem to know the way around better than I do.

653
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,720
No.

654
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,800
I used to be

655
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,560
a waitress here,

656
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,760
so I know the way pretty well.

657
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,160
Sir, your room is over there.

658
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,000
Didn't you say you were a designated driver?

659
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,640
How did you become a waitress?

660
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,160
Used to be a waitress, now I'm a designated driver.

661
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,440
What nonsense?

662
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,200
Look,

663
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
whatever you are,

664
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,640
get lost now.

665
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,960
Don't ever let me see you again.

666
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,600
Got it?

667
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,440
Yes, yes.

668
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm leaving, leaving now.

669
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,200
Sorry, sorry.

670
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

671
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,840
This way.

672
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,920
Thank you.

673
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

674
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,640
Mr. He.

675
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,080
Do you know her?

676
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,000
No.

677
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,920
Just a designated driver looking to
make some money.

678
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,920
We drank,

679
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
so we do need a designated driver.

680
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
You didn't have to come out

681
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,160
to get the two of us.

682
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,520
Come on, let's go back.

683
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,400
Okay.

684
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,200
What was that? It was pretty hard.

685
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
I have a feeling

686
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,800
I'll have bookings tonight.

687
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,120
At least one.

688
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,000
Mr. He.

689
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,320
It seems we've drunk enough.

690
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,960
Let's talk about the design plans.

691
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,520
Mr. Xu said no work talk tonight.

692
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,040
Right.

693
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,200
Tonight is time

694
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,080
for everyone to relax.

695
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,520
It's after-work hours.

696
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,960
Since Mr. Gu is here,

697
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,360
how about a drink?

698
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm sorry.

699
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't drink.

700
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,720
Just water for me.

701
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,680
Mr. Gu, you're not giving me face.

702
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
Mr. He, that's not it.

703
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,320
Gu Chuan never drinks.

704
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,720
Here, let me drink in his place.

705
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,840
Mr. Xu,

706
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,200
Mr. Gu is even more hopeless than you are.

707
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,800
Forget it.

708
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,840
This is boring.

709
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,880
Coming here and only drinking water.

710
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
How about getting hot pot takeout

711
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,600
and eating it here, as a late-night snack?

712
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,360
I don't eat hot pot either.

713
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,560
Mr. He.

714
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,880
How about this.

715
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,720
Bottoms up.

716
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,800
Miss Su gets me.

717
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
My companion.

718
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,160
Let's paint the town red!

719
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,680
Let's!

720
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,040
Oh my.

721
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,760
Are you raising a fish?

722
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,680
You can't drink like this.

723
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
You have to be punished.

724
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,360
Two drinks.

725
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,240
Come on.

726
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,280
Let's finish this one.

727
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,800
Mr. He, Mr. He.

728
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,840
She has drunk so much already.

729
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,480
If you like to drink this much,

730
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,840
let me.

731
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,880
Chuan, stop it.

732
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,760
You can't.

733
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,120
Mr. He, he can't even have one.

734
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,720
He's going to transform if he does.

735
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,760
I'm okay.

736
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,360
Nice!

737
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,000
So you can drink.

738
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,920
Then why did you pretend?

739
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,640
Chuan, if you feel sick,

740
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,880
go ahead, and leave.

741
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,280
Leave?

742
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
It's still early.

743
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,680
Chuan, let me take you home.

744
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,920
It's fine.

745
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,640
You have to go.

746
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,000
Fine.

747
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,720
Mr. He.

748
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,760
Let's get together another time.

749
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,400
Come.

750
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,440
Do you really need to shake hands?

751
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,080
This is my show of good faith.

752
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,640
Okay.

753
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,720
Another time, then.

754
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
How many bookings have you had?

755
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,920
Two.

756
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,440
Don't know what's up today.

757
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,600
So few bookings.

758
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,720
Ah well.

759
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
How about you?

760
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,080
I haven't gotten any yet.

761
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,480
That sucks.

762
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,440
It must be hard

763
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,360
for a girl like you to be a designated driver.

764
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,000
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

765
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,920
What happened to me?

766
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,120
Nothing.

767
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,920
Sir.

768
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,560
Do you need a designated driver?

769
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,320
Yes, yes, yes.

770
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Wait wait wait.

771
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,760
It's you again.

772
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,880
A female driver.

773
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,240
No, no, no.

774
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
What's wrong with a female driver?

775
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
Female drivers are drivers too.

776
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,640
I have a driver's licence.

777
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,320
Sir.

778
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,640
Don't be sexist.

779
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,280
It can't be you.

780
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
Let me, let me, let me.

781
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,520
I'll do it.

782
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,240
The car is over there.

783
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:04,720
Okay.

784
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
Where is Su Man Lin?

785
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,200
Boss, be careful.

786
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,760
Su Man Lin.

787
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,720
I want to keep drinking with her.

788
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,120
Be careful.

789
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,560
My bro needs a designated driver too.

790
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,639
He's back there. His last name is Gu.

791
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
Okay, thank you.

792
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,400
Slowly, Mr. He.

793
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,320
Thank you.

794
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:15,880
No problem.

795
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,280
Mr. Xu.

796
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,719
Come come come. Slowly.

797
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,159
Mr. Gu?

798
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
You need a designated driver right?

799
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,920
I know her.

800
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,080
She has my card.

801
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,520
Did you guys come together?

802
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,840
You're okay?

803
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm okay.

804
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,440
I know you too.

805
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,880
Trust me.

806
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,280
I'll get you home safe and sound.

807
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Plus,

808
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,719
I'll give you a 100 yuan discount.

809
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
You said you know me?

810
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,120
Yeah.

811
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
This morning.

812
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,320
White toast, 100 yuan.

813
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,960
Milky toast.

814
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,760
Thank you.

815
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,080
Okay, okay.

816
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,880
Your toast.

817
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
I remember now.

818
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,280
That's why I said

819
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll give you a 100 yuan discount.

820
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,840
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

821
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,960
Give me a minute.

822
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,320
Go take a breath.

823
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,160
Mr. Gu,

824
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm really sorry.

825
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
I have this habit when driving at night.

826
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,880
When there is a truck,

827
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,520
I always pull over

828
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,840
to let it pass.

829
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,760
Why?

830
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,760
My habit has nothing to do with

831
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,560
me being a female driver.

832
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,640
It might be because of a car accident.

833
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,760
Anyway, safety first.

834
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,760
Car accident?

835
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,560
It's nothing,

836
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,880
just a bit of psychological trauma.

837
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,120
I promise it won't affect

838
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,360
the safety of my driving.

839
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,080
Dad! A truck!

840
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

841
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,240
I… I got nervous all of a sudden.

842
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,560
Did you need to get this nervous?

843
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,080
Why did the lights go out?

844
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,680
Mr. Gu.

845
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,680
Let me go check.

846
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,600
What's going on?

847
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,960
Why can't I turn the engine on?

848
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,560
You can't turn it on?

849
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,520
Mr. Gu.

850
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
I swear I didn't do anything,

851
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,760
I was just driving.

852
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,600
It's not your problem.

853
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,120
But this car broke down

854
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,520
while I was driving it.

855
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,120
I'll take responsibility.

856
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,920
No need.

857
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,240
Call a tow truck.

858
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I didn't know

859
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,080
tow trucks also provide drop-off service.

860
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Thank you, mister.

861
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,720
Please help me

862
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,240
drop her off at home.

863
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
Do you know Jia Lin Hua Yuan?

864
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,680
Your girlfriend

865
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,160
doesn't live with you?

866
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,240
She's not my girlfriend.

867
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,200
Sorry, my bad.

868
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,040
Leave it to me.

869
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,160
Bye-bye.

870
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,560
Mister, we can go.

871
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,400
Charging.

872
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,980
