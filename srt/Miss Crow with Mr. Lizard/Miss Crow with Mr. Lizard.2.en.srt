alright?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,880
Don't look at me like that.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,920
I didn't touch you last night.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,280
Please believe me.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Could you please let me explain?

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
I would like to know

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
what happened last night as well.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Didn't you agree

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
to break up?

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Don't cry.

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,160
I know you didn't touch me,

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,120
but I don't understand.

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
I got drunk

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,440
on my own initiative.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Why didn't you do anything?

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Did I do something wrong?

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,960
I've been handling this order

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
for almost three months.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,400
I believe our company

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
is your best option

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,640
on the market.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,640
I just hope that

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
you can give us a chance.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,320
Let's try working together.

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Of course there will be opportunities,

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
but it'll depend on

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
how you're going to repay me.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Why don't you like me?

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
No reason.

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,680
Then why

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,480
did you drink with me,

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,680
take me to a hotel,

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,400
and

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
sleep next to me?

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
I paid for the room

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,720
and I had a lot of drink too.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
Did you expect me to sleep on the sofa?

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,080
I...

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,920
I will do my best,

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
give it everything I can.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
No, no, no.

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,040
That's not important.

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,640
The repayment I'm referring to

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
has nothing to do with the order.

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560
This

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
is the key card to my private room upstairs.

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Take it.

69
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
It'll give you easier access.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Mr. Ouyang,

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
there's no need to go through such trouble.

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,080
If there are any specific questions,

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
I'll communicate with your assistant.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,520
No need to waste any of your time.

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,480
Pretty high EQ.

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,520
I like it.

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
You don't need to be shy.

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,560
We're each getting what we want.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,920
Helping each other out.

80
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
Working intimately.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm leaving.

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
You're a smart girl.

83
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
You know what I want.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Give me a chance,

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,200
I know you'll like me.

86
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Exceptional people

88
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
tend to be very busy,

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,640
so I don't have time to waste

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
on love.

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't contact me anymore.

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,760
Thank you.

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,280
Mr. Ouyang.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Mr. Ouyang.

95
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Why in such a rush?

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,400
Mr. Ouyang, I think you may have misunderstood.

97
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,080
I didn't.

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm telling you, I can support you.

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
Your boss, Mr. Wei, told me

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
you're single.

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,520
You need someone to look after you.

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Otherwise, you'll have trouble

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
falling asleep by yourself at night.

104
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,280
Looking after me at work is enough,

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
please

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,200
don't trouble yourself over my personal life.

107
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
I know that

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
you really need a man in your life,

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,920
especially a man like me.

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
Scumbag.

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,560
Sorry, sorry.

113
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Thank you.

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,600
You've got moves, lady.

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Ran into a scumbag?

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
It's okay.

117
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Have a drink and sleep it off.

118
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,640
Trust me,

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,000
I've been there.

120
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm not a scumbag,

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
why did you hit me?

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,520
Sir,

123
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
do you need help?

124
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,520
No,

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,520
but someone on the third floor does.

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:07,960
Okay.

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,760
Hold on.

128
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
Um,

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
do you have a tissue?

130
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,660
(Car repair shop)

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
How do you feel?

132
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you want to throw up?

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Hold on.

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Here, here, here.

135
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Here's a bag.

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
In here.

137
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
Here, here, here.

138
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Have some yogurt.

139
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
Your stomach will feel better.

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,400
Here.

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
You have everything in your bag, huh?

142
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm a pro.

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
You're pretty clever.

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
If you need a designated driver,

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
call me anytime.

146
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
I have your card.

147
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I'll call you

148
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
if I need you.

149
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,720
Great.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,640
Only 600 metres till we reach the car.

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,000
Just hold on a little longer.

152
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
You called a car?

153
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,280
Thank you.

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,520
No worries.

155
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm already so grateful that

156
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,280
you didn't hold me accountable for your car.

157
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,840
I'll only feel at ease

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
once we get you home safely.

159
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Is being a designated driver your job?

160
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
It's a part-time job.

161
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,120
Originally,

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,920
I was working at a bakery,

163
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,440
but today,

164
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400
the bakery shut down.

165
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
So you're unemployed?

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
I guess so.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
The car's here. Let's get in.

168
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,360
Come on.

169
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,080
Be careful.

170
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
Slowly, slowly.

171
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,320
This watch can monitor

172
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
your heart rate,

173
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,320
but

174
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,880
it's only an estimate

175
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,600
based on the rate of your blood flow,

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
since you don't actually have a pulse.

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
This car accident

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,520
caused your chest cavity to be punctured,

179
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,920
severely damaging your heart.

180
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
This mechanical heart

181
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
can give you a second life.

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
However, you should know that

183
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,840
it will also

184
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,360
bring you pain, which you must endure.

185
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,200
Its working noise

186
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
may cause you severe insomnia.

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
If the mechanical heart

188
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,520
"beats" too fast,

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,840
you will also be in great pain.

190
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,960
Also,

191
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,679
there will be

192
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,400
restrictions to your life.

193
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
You won't be able to exercise,

194
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,320
drink,

195
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,520
or fall in love.

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
When other people fall in love,

197
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,080
it's happiness.

198
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,120
But when you do,

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,800
it'll be very dangerous.

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,560
So,

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
you can't allow yourself

202
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,280
to feel too much from now on.

203
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,680
It has been ten years.

204
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
This heart used to be able

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,400
to work for 20 consecutive hours.

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
Now, it can only work for 10.

207
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
Its usage time is getting shorter,

208
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,960
while its charging speed is slowing down.

209
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
The doctor told me everything,

210
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,320
except for one thing.

211
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,040
This mechanical heart

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,960
has another

213
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,440
new side effect,

214
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
which is

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
an electric discharge.

216
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
When the heart rate reaches 100 bpm,

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
the human body

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,080
can feel the discharge.

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
At 110 bpm,

220
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,040
there's enough discharge to light up a light bulb

221
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,880
and the human body will feel pain.

222
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,720
If it reaches 180 bpm...

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
I haven't experienced that either.

224
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,960
It might be a disaster.

225
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,680
But...

226
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
Mr. Gu?

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
You need a designated driver?

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,720
Why was she unaffected?

229
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
Big brother, where are you?

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
I can't see you.

231
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Is this your cake?

232
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,680
It's my birthday today.

233
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,080
Wishing you

234
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,040
happiness every day.

235
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,200
Big brother.

236
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,160
Hello.

237
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm the one you drove home last night,

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,240
Su Man Lin.

239
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
Our company is hiring.

240
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
If you're interested,

241
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,080
come to Chuan Studios

242
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
on the 18th floor of the Yun Yi building

243
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
at 10 o'clock in the morning.

244
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
Thank you for the opportunity.

245
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
I'll be there on time.

246
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Grandma! Aunty!

247
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm getting a new job!

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Jiang Xiao Ning,

249
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
this is where

250
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
you will start anew.

251
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,040
Let's go!

252
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Mr. Gu?

253
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Mr. Gu!

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,240
Gu... Gu...

255
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,800
Gu...

256
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Is your hand okay?

257
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,880
It's fine.

258
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,920
That's good.

259
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,800
The building's management

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,000
has already contacted us.

261
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,520
They may get in touch

262
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,880
if there are any issues moving forward.

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,120
Are they looking for compensation?

264
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,440
They should be compensating you instead.

265
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,760
It's the management's negligence.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
They failed to identify this safety hazard.

267
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,480
That's good.

268
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,520
It's okay,

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,360
this is just a small matter.

270
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
No one has it easy.

271
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,560
So here's the deal.

272
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,440
We are hiring

273
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,840
an assistant for Mr. Gu.

274
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,120
Looking at your resume...

275
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,480
You know how to drive?

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,360
That's good.

277
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Very good.

278
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
Yes.

279
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,400
A lot of my previous jobs

280
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,200
were in the service industry,

281
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,520
so I have some experience when it comes to

282
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,320
the service industry,

283
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,040
which can be applied here.

284
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
I don't need an assistant.

285
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,160
Actually, I have a lot of strengths.

286
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm extremely diligent.

287
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,240
I only need four to five hours of sleep a day

288
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,640
to function, energetically, for the whole day.

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,640
And I don't really get sick.

290
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,880
My sense of pain is delayed.

291
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,840
Small cuts and bruises

292
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
don't get to me at all.

293
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,720
I won't let any illness or injuries

294
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,840
affect my work.

295
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
Even if I need an assistant,

296
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,400
it should be

297
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,680
an assistant architect.

298
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,440
I studied architectural design.

299
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,800
Although I didn't graduate,

300
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,040
I have some basic knowledge.

301
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm still learning.

302
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
You haven't graduated?

303
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,720
Then study hard.

304
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
We'll talk after you've graduated.

305
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,560
I'll be extra diligent.

306
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,400
Please give me a chance.

307
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,000
I knew it would end like this.

308
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Miss Su, I'm sorry.

309
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,680
It's my fault.

310
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,800
It's okay.

311
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,480
It was my fault for not being clear.

312
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
I didn't know you are still a student.

313
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,400
Actually, I dropped out.

314
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
I want to earn enough money

315
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,800
before going back to university.

316
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
I won't trouble you further.

317
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,380
(Chuan Design Studios)

318
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Man Lin,

319
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,520
were you okay last night?

320
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,400
Yeah.

321
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
The designated driver girl

322
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,080
took care of me all night long.

323
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,280
She seemed nice

324
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
and meticulous,

325
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,360
so I asked her to come for an interview

326
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,360
to be Mr. Gu's assistant.

327
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,840
What did Gu Chuan say?

328
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,920
Mr. Gu says he doesn't need an assistant.

329
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
If he needed one,

330
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
it would have to be a design assistant.

331
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,760
He asked her to study hard in her major

332
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
and come back after she graduates.

333
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Studies design, knows how to drive,

334
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
meticulous,

335
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,800
she's a perfect fit.

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,640
What is Gu Chuan thinking?

337
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,760
Looks like I'll have to get involved.

338
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Just you wait.

339
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
Good luck.

340
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Miss, is your hand okay?

341
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,760
It's fine, it's fine.

342
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,040
If there are any issues,

343
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,040
reach out to us anytime.

344
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,880
Sure, apologies.

345
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,480
Really sorry.

346
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
It… it's okay, it's okay.

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Take it easy.

348
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,280
Okay.

349
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
I'm fine, I'm fine.

350
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,720
Slow down, slow down.

351
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,440
Okay.

352
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,080
Drawing again?

353
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,680
Why didn't you knock?

354
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,120
Heard that you killed

355
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Miss Designated Driver's dreams
of becoming an assistant.

356
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,440
Don't you normally stay out of

357
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
the studio's affairs?

358
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,000
I want to get involved in this.

359
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
This matter concerns me greatly.

360
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,880
If you think I'm annoying

361
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
you can ignore me.

362
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Hello, Sister Yan Yan.

363
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
How was the interview?

364
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,560
I didn't get picked.

365
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Still laughing despite not getting picked?

366
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,440
I’m used to it.

367
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
I'll just try again.

368
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,040
Good.

369
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,600
How about this.

370
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,240
I'll go to your place for dinner tonight

371
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,280
and get extra food for your aunt and grandma.

372
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,160
Sure, see you tonight.

373
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,560
Let me be honest with you.

374
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,680
It was me who asked

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,880
Wang Kai and Su Man Lin

376
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,840
to look for an assistant for you.

377
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
I just wanted to get you

378
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
a personal assistant,

379
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
like a female driver.

380
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
I don't need one.

381
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
You do, I do too.

382
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
If you need one,

383
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,040
you can get Wang Kai

384
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,200
to find you one.

385
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
The girl who came today

386
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,440
was the designated driver

387
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,360
who got me home last night.

388
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,720
Her driving is okay.

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
She just lost her job.

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
You can help her out.

391
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,080
You helping her is as good as helping me.

392
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,400
You said it yourself,

393
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,680
her driving is okay.

394
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,120
And she studies design,

395
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,120
which can be considered relevant.

396
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
You can't keep getting me

397
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,360
to be your driver.

398
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm very busy every day.

399
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,760
Are you?

400
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,520
I am.

401
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,800
Incredibly busy.

402
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,560
I think you're busy having meals,

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
shopping,

404
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,320
and gaming

405
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,760
with all your girlfriends.

406
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
This is pure

407
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,480
envy, jealousy, and hate.

408
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,040
There's nothing to be envious, jealous,
or hateful about.

409
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Maybe hate.

410
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,280
But I don't hate you.

411
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
I just hate myself

412
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
for not dying earlier.

413
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
Okay, I misspoke.

414
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,280
Don't think so much, okay?

415
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,079
It's okay.

416
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,319
I'm not bothered by anything you say.

417
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,480
Chuan,

418
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,079
stop spending all your time thinking

419
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,839
about those pointless things.

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,359
You need to have some hope in life.

421
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,480
You still have this studio

422
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,800
and your parents.

423
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
Say no more,

424
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,920
you can't outtalk me.

425
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
I can't outtalk you,

426
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,200
but I can annoy the hell out of you.

427
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
You have everyone, you have me.

428
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,079
You need to be responsible for me.

429
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,480
Right now,

430
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,000
I really want to tell you...

431
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,280
To get lost, right?

432
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,200
It's okay.

433
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,200
I have thick skin.

434
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,440
I won't get lost.

435
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,720
Since you don't like

436
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,600
other people watching after you,

437
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,280
then my apologies,

438
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,160
I'll just have to sacrifice

439
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,000
my precious time

440
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,400
to watch after you myself.

441
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
What can you do with me?

442
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,400
Fine.

443
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,960
Do whatever you want.

444
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,780
(Book title "Introduction to
Modern Spatial Architecture")

445
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,860
(Introduction to Modern Spatial Architecture)

446
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,240
My book!

447
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Mr. Gu.

448
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,560
You read this too?

449
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,200
You can have it if you like.

450
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
This is the last one.

451
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay, I'll take it then.

452
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,440
Why do you keep following me?

453
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Can I discuss something with you?

454
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,400
Let me copy your book.

455
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
I'll return it to you after I'm done copying.

456
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,040
My copying speed is really fast.

457
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,400
This book?

458
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
You can have it.

459
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,040
That won't do.

460
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,040
If you need this book

461
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,400
for your studies,

462
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,360
I'll just buy another book.

463
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Then let's add each other on WeChat.

464
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,440
I'll transfer the money to you.

465
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,320
No need.

466
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,200
That won't do.

467
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,200
I'll feel better

468
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,880
if I pay for my own study material.

469
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,280
Let me scan you.

470
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
Study hard.

471
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Mr. Gu!

472
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,720
I gave you the book.

473
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
Why are you still following me?

474
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,760
Can I ask you a question?

475
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,640
Okay.

476
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
What's the real reason

477
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,160
behind you rejecting me?

478
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,600
I don't need an assistant.

479
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
But I need this job.

480
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,280
So?

481
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
Does that mean I have to hire you?

482
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
That's not what I meant.

483
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Although I dropped out of school,

484
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,880
I'm still learning on my own

485
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
in order to pursue my dreams.

486
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
Now that

487
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,560
there's a chance

488
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
to work in a design studio,

489
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
this opportunity is too precious

490
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,080
to me.

491
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,720
With this job,

492
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,320
I can support my family

493
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,640
and interact closely with

494
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,960
professionals.

495
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,120
Once I've saved enough money,

496
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,800
I can go back to university and finish my studies.

497
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,040
First,

498
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,080
your dream

499
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,960
has nothing to do with me.

500
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
Next,

501
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,640
if you want to be

502
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,600
a designer,

503
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
there are no shortcuts.

504
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,280
The only path for you

505
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,560
is to continue your studies.

506
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,320
You're right.

507
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,360
But in this world,

508
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,240
there's always

509
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,080
more than one path to any destination.

510
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,260
♪Caught off-guard by our first encounter♪

511
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,860
♪And the corner of your mouth is lifting♪

512
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,100
♪Heart pounding involuntarily,
this phenomenon♪

513
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,000
♪Am I abnormal or are you shining♪

514
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
Although I made a detour,

515
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm not wasting my time.

516
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,480
Even if I have to sacrifice more than others,

517
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,440
I believe

518
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,600
as long as I keep going,

519
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,200
I'll reach my destination.

520
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,040
It's just that along the way,

521
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,920
I need

522
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
pioneers like you

523
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,400
to give me a chance.

524
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
Our destinations are different.

525
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,960
My office is over there.

526
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,880
Missed a crossing.

527
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,120
Your thinking isn't bad.

528
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
But what you need the most now

529
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,600
is to continue studying.

530
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,080
If you have any

531
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,160
financial difficulties,

532
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
you can apply for scholarships

533
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,120
or loans.

534
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,320
Actually,

535
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,800
I can take a bus in front of your office building.

536
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,040
Balloons, balloons, balloons!

537
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,360
Balloons, balloons, balloons!

538
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,840
Balloons!

539
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,200
My balloons!

540
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,880
How much must that have cost.

541
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,360
Gu,

542
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,840
did something happen to you?

543
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
No, nothing.

544
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
I saw that your heart rate

545
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
has been extremely high.

546
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,680
That's not good.

547
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,560
I know.

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
Come to the lab next week.

549
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,960
Several patches need to be updated.

550
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,000
Will they help?

551
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,400
Of course.

552
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,560
The working noise

553
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,440
will decrease by around ten percent.

554
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,760
And?

555
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
That's it.

556
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,840
I'm still working on the rest.

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
Continue working at it then.

558
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,040
Gu,

559
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,160
are you unhappy with me?

560
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm not unhappy with you.

561
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm unhappy with myself.

562
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,400
Forget it, forget it.

563
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,560
Let's not talk about this.

564
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,160
Come to the lab next week

565
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,400
to do your updates.

566
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,160
I won't be going.

567
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,360
I want to make use of this time

568
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,240
to win the Jin An Award as soon as possible.

569
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,880
Is that award more important,

570
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,120
or is your life more important?

571
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,800
Everyone

572
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,960
has a different view of life.

573
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,680
To Gu Chuan,

574
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,040
it's better to be dead.

575
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,200
Gu!

576
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,360
Okay, Doctor.

577
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,720
I have things to attend to.

578
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
Let's end the conversation here.

579
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,560
Thank you.

580
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,920
Hello.

581
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,800
This is yours, right?

582
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,680
Okay.

583
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
Here you go, come again soon!

584
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
Dear customer,

585
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,160
is there something you need?

586
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,880
I need you.

587
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
Me?

588
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,920
Then you might have to

589
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,920
wait a little longer.

590
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,720
There's still a while before I get off work.

591
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,600
Okay.

592
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,200
Dear customer,

593
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,240
do you want to participate

594
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,880
in our activity today?

595
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,800
What activity?

596
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,240
Come, come, come.

597
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,920
As long as you put on this mask,

598
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,960
hold this stick,

599
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,360
and hit any of these alphabets,

600
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,760
you'll get a surprise gift.

601
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
We're doing it on a just and equitable basis.

602
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,320
Don't peek.

603
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
Don't cheat.

604
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,840
Just and equitable.

605
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,880
Please begin.

606
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Hit!

607
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,680
Okay, okay, okay.

608
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,280
Is that good?

609
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,080
Yes, yes, yes.

610
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,560
What's this?

611
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,360
Snacks from Lai Yi Fen.

612
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,240
Two bags!

613
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,120
Really?

614
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,720
Follow me, dear customer.

615
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Come, come, come.

616
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,120
This much?

617
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,480
Two gift bags of fresh snacks from

618
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,840
Lai Yi Fen!

619
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,440
Do you mean I get two bags?

620
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,040
It's because you have such good luck.

621
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
All thanks to you.

622
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,160
Keep it up later.

623
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,320
Miss Jiang Xiao Ning

624
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,600
recently

625
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,840
got a new job

626
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,800
at a famous architectural design company,

627
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,840
working as a receptionist.

628
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,640
Very good, very good.

629
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,120
I believe in your acting skills.

630
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,280
Thank you, Director Jiang, for your affirmation.

631
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
Let me repay you.

632
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
Finally getting off work.

633
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,760
Let me give you a lift.

634
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,080
It's fine.

635
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
I'll walk.

636
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
What do people like me

637
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,480
live for?

638
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,040
If life

639
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,400
had already flashed a red light,

640
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,080
shouldn't you stop

641
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,200
and wait for death?

642
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
Or are you supposed to

643
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,080
use this time

644
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,360
to do something meaningful?

645
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
Although I took a detour,

646
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm not wasting my time.

647
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,160
Even if I have to sacrifice more than others,

648
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,920
I believe

649
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,120
as long as I keep going,

650
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,560
I'll reach my destination.

651
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,040
Just that on the way,

652
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,880
I need

653
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,040
pioneers like you

654
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,560
to give me a chance.

Food is ready.

672
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Grandma,

673
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,560
it isn't the lobster season yet.

674
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,080
Let's have some crayfish first.

675
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
Sure, sure.

676
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,600
Sure.

677
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Jiang Xiao Ning,

678
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
did you pick up some money?

679
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Or do you not want to live anymore?

680
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't scare aunty.

681
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,080
Aunty,

682
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,080
Xiao Ning got a new job,

683
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,440
of course we need to celebrate.

684
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,280
That's right.

685
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,560
Aunty, Grandma,

686
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,680
this time I'm working in

687
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,760
a Class A office building.

688
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,120
An architectural design company.

689
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,640
Don't you think that's worth celebrating?

690
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,200
Our Xiao Ning has made something of herself.

691
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,400
She has made something of herself.

692
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,400
That's not too bad.

693
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,080
Xiao Ning,

694
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,000
what kind of job is it this time?

695
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Receptionist.

696
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,920
That's fine too, that's fine too.

697
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,800
Xiao Ning's dream

698
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
is to be an architect,

699
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,760
right?

700
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,520
This is slightly related,

701
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,080
right?

702
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,200
It's okay, it's okay.

703
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,080
Make your way up slowly, slowly.

704
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
That's right.

705
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,320
Ning Ning,

706
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
Aunty hopes that

707
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
your dream comes true.

708
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Grandma too.

709
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,720
Grandma too.

710
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,200
Yan Yan too.

711
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Thank you.

712
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
Cheers!

713
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,640
Yan Yan,

714
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
Aunty has introduced

715
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
so many guys to you.

716
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,640
Isn't there one you fancy?

717
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,760
Aunty,

718
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,600
I fancy them,

719
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,480
but they don't fancy me.

720
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,840
You need to continue helping me.

721
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,840
Come on.

722
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,040
You're the same as Aunty,

723
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,720
it must be that your expectations

724
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,240
are too high,

725
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,000
right?

726
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
My expectations aren't high at all.

727
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,600
In fact, my standards are really low.

728
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,040
Just needs to be like Andy Lau.

729
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,760
I don't like

730
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,680
what you're saying.

731
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,360
How is your Uncle

732
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
low in quality?

733
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,160
Who is Andy Lau?

734
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,840
Mom,

735
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,800
Andy Lau is your son-in-law.

736
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,080
Have you forgotten?

737
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
Ask Andy Lau to join us for dinner.

738
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Give him a call.

739
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,920
Get our son-in-law to join us for dinner.

740
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Okay, we'll call.

741
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,800
Eat.

742
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,980
(Mom)

743
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Hello, Mom.

744
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,080
Little Chuan,

745
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,080
are you going to bed?

746
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,280
Soon.

747
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
How's your health recently?

748
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,720
Pretty good.

749
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,480
Dad and Mom are coming back to China
to settle some stuff.

750
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
We want to pay you a visit.

751
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
Do you have time?

752
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,160
I do.

753
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,240
We discussed and decided

754
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,240
that we won't be leaving

755
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,880
after returning home this time.

756
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,480
We want to live with you.

757
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,960
Not sure if you're willing?

758
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,680
If you're okay

759
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,480
with it,

760
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,440
we plan to

761
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,640
sell our house over here

762
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,320
and buy one near you.

763
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,600
This way,

764
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,760
Mom can cook good food

765
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,080
and clean the house

766
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,640
for you every day.

767
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,520
And you

768
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,800
can concentrate on your work,

769
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
play chess with your dad when you're free,

770
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
have chats with me.

771
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,760
This way,

772
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,640
we, as a family,

773
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,720
can live like we used to.

774
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,280
How about it?

775
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,840
Little Chuan, are you listening?

776
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,720
I am.

777
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,520
Mom,

778
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,200
I'm used to living alone.

779
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,520
I won't be used to it

780
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,080
if you guys come over.

781
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,240
But you need someone to take care of you.

782
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,160
Besides,

783
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
when you've lived alone for so long,

784
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,800
you'll start having psychological problems

785
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,720
sooner or later.

786
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm doing very well.

787
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,440
Little Chuan,

788
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,520
why do you keep

789
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,880
pushing us away?

790
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,360
What did we do wrong?

791
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,840
You can tell us.

792
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,960
Mom,

793
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
I've told you many times.

794
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

795
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
It's just that

796
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,040
I need my own personal space.

797
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,000
But we're a family.

798
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,840
We can't always be this estranged.

799
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,120
Son, has Mom been

800
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,160
doing poorly in any aspect?

801
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,160
If I haven't been doing good enough,

802
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,960
I apologise.

803
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,320
Apologise?

804
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,560
For what?

805
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,040
We don't owe him.

806
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,000
(Operation Room)
Doctor,

807
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,080
how is my son doing?

808
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,520
His heart has sustained severe damage

809
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,600
and his blood pressure is too low.

810
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,960
He's in critical condition

811
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,840
and no longer suitable for

812
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,200
a heart transplant.

813
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,760
Doctor!

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,640
Please save my son! I beg you!

815
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,560
Isn’t there another way?

816
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,760
There is one way that

817
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,040
may give him a chance,

818
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:37,800
but

819
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,680
are you willing

820
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
to give it a shot?

821
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,160
What is it?

822
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
A mechanical heart implant.

823
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,680
Mechanical heart?

824
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The R&D is done by Dr. Peer.

825
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,840
Mechanical hearts

826
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
are the only

827
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,240
clinically-proven

828
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,400
artificial heart product.

829
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,760
The possibility of rejection

830
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,680
is very low.

831
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,720
But there will be side effects

832
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,360
during its use.

833
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Moreover,

834
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,440
future maintenance will be very expensive.

835
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,960
As long as it will help my son live,

836
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,040
we're willing to

837
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,680
accept any procedure.

838
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay.

839

♪The destined person♪

840
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm sorry.

841
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,040
If I

842
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
distance myself from you,

843
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,760
maybe you won’t be too heart-broken

844
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,480
when I die.

845
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,960
I'm ready

846
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
to leave this world,

847
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,880
but I'm not ready

848
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,320
to say goodbye to you.

849
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,720
The mechanical heart

850
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,040
uses a built-in turbine to

851
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,720
pump human blood through a mechanical pump

852
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,920
to the aorta.

853
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,320
The internal magnetic field allows the turbine

854
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,040
to run in suspension.

855
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
It won’t create any friction

856
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,760
and the parts won’t have

857
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,720
any wear-and-tear.

858
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,480
It has a lifespan of at least ten years.

859
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Around the world, 400 patients

862

Hey kid, wake up!

884
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,600
Aunty, what are you doing?

885
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,000
For your first day,

886
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,600
Aunty got some new clothes for you.

887
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

888
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,840
Get up!

889
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,000
New clothes?

890
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,320
Aunty, these are a little too big.

891
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,440
No, they aren't.

892
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,480
The relaxed fit is the trend this year.

893
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
These are Aunty’s most expensive clothes.

894
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm telling you,

895
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,160
these are too precious to wear.

896
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,040
Which is older? Me or the clothes?

897
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,640
Fashion goes round in circles.

898
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
In my opinion,

899
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,480
it’s time these make a comeback.

900
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,640
Xiao Ning,

901
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,560
this outfit looks good on you,

902
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,080
really good.

903
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,960
See?

904
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,760
Really?

905
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,720
You look just as good as your aunt.

906
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,440
What's with your expression?

907
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,360
You don’t believe me?

908
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:11,920
I'm telling you,

909
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,360
I used to be a beauty back in the days,

910
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,920
the prettiest in the neighbourhood.

911
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,600
If my suitors were to line up here,

912
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,160
the line would go all the way to Shanghai.

913
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,960
Mom,

914
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,680
right?

915
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Right.

916
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,400
You're my daughter, of course you’re pretty.

917
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,160
That's...

918
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,000
Xiao Ning,

919
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,440
these clothes do look nice,

920
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,040
but do they meet the school dress code?

921
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,280
Granny,

922
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,440
she's going to work.

923
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,640
Nonsense.

924
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,000
She's too young

925
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,520
to work.

926
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,600
Xiao Ning, come here.

927
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Take this to school,

928
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,800
share it with your classmates.

929
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,720
Thanks, Grandma.

930
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,600
Wasn't she doing well two days ago?

931
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,280
She's in her 70s.

932
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,520
Sometimes she can think clearly,

933
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,640
sometimes she can't.

934
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,840
Alright.

935
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,600
If you guys say these look good,

936
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,800
then it must be the truth.

937
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,480
I'll wear this outfit to work today.

938
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,520
Are you happy?

939
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,200
Absolutely.

940
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,680
I'm going to work.

941
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,560
Mom,

942
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,120
you changed the channel again.

943
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,560
Can we look at a different male celebrity?

944
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,860
(Yang Chun Alley #10)

945
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,100
(Yang Chun Alley)

946
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,120
Brother Xu.

947
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,760
Xiao Ning.

948
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,880
Xiao Ning,

949
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,840
your outfit is quite

950
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,560
retro disco.

951
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,680
Brother Xu, can you not

952
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
make fun of me as soon as we meet?

953
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,880
How could I, Boss Jiang?

954
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
I just think it’s pretty cute.

955
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,840
Aunty made me

956
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,000
wear her clothes to work.

957
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,240
Work?

958
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
You found a new job?

959
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,080
Let me take this call.

960
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
Hello?

961
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,600
This is Jiang Xiao Ning.

962
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,720
Yes, yes.

963
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,920
Now is fine.

964
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,280
I won't be late.

965
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,400
Thank you.

966
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,200
Xiao Ning, what is it?

967
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
What did you ask me just now?

968
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,640
I was just asking whether

969
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
you had found a new job?

970
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,760
I hadn’t originally,

971
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,880
but now I have.

972
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,280
And it's related to architectural design.

973
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,520
Assistant to the boss.

974
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
Nice going, Xiao Ning!

975
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,960
Brother Xu,

976
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,000
I need to borrow the back seat of your car

977
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
to make some adjustments to my outfit.

978
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh right.

979
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,240
Those are for you.

980
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,480
You brought me gifts again?

981
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,520
I can’t take them.

982
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,000
I just happened to pass Lai Yi Fen on my way here.

983
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Snacks?

984
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,080
Snacks are okay.

985
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,600
Grandma was just telling me

986
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,360
to share this with my friends.

987
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
Thank you, my good friend.

988
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,600
It’s your first day,

989
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,720
let me drop you off.

990
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,920
Driver Tang.

991
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,160
We're going to be late.

992
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,000
What are you waiting for?

993
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,280
Yes, Boss Jiang,

994
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,000
right away.

995
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,800
Best of luck, Xiao Ning.

996
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,800
Okay.

997
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,400
Brother Xu, drive safe.

998
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,040
Good luck.

999
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,720
Bye-bye.

1000
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,680
Bye-bye.

1001
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,360
Miss.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1003
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,280
Did you get hurt?

1004
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,800
Did it hurt? Up you get.

1005
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1006
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1007
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,840
I’m so sorry.

1008
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,200
It’s okay, Aunty.

1009
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
It's okay.
