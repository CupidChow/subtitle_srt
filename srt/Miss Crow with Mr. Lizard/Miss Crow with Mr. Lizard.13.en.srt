=Episode 13=

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Is that style

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,600
too modern?

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,920
No.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,840
Although it appears to be

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
a bit run-down,

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,280
but it's actually not

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,040
one of those outdated cafes from decades ago.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,560
A lot of people

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,200
come here

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,160
is purely because of

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
its good location.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
If you place other cafes

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,240
at this location,

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
it'll achieve the same effect.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
What we need to do

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
is to make everyone

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,160
have the desire to

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,600
come in and take a photo

39
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,400
after having one look at this cafe.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,680
Although some designers

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,440
may despise this sort of thing,

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
this is the best method

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
for businessmen.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
And it's the best way for this cafe to

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
integrate into its surroundings.

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,680
Industrial style or retro style

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,840
doesn't really suit this place.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,600
Okay, I got it.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Mr. Gu, the exhibition hall project

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
is going very well.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
I'll send you

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
our finalized proposal shortly.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,880
Okay.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
The owner of the cafe will

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,200
be here soon.

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,600
He must have been stuck in traffic.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm going down to take a walk.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Let me know when the owner is here.

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay.

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Penny for your thoughts?

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,200
You guys are done with the discussion?

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,640
Why didn't you come up and join us?

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
You guys were talking business.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
Sister Man Lin also told me that
she would let me know

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
what you guys discussed.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,240
Let's go.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
We're here.

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Here.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
Sister Man Lin, this is your room.

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,240
Boss, your room is over here.

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,120
Let's see.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,000
Here.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,280
Boss, your room key.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm just next door.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
Let me know if you need anything.

76
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,760
Okay.

77
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
This is a really nice room.

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,960
Hello, Boss.

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
Do you really need to be this polite?

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
We've only been apart for less than a minute.

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
That's true.

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,320
Boss,

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
I heard the hot springs here are pretty good.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
You can soak in the hot springs at night

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
and look at the stars.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
It's cloudy now.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,480
I believe as long as you wait patiently,

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
you'll be able to see them.

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Although this place doesn't

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,120
have the pollution or haze

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
from the city,

92
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,360
I should still advise you

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,280
you'd better check

94
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
the weather forecast

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,560
in the future.

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
But what if the weather forecast is wrong?

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
I shall still go to the hot springs,

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
or else I've come here for nothing.

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
Sister Wen Wen, what a coincidence.

100
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Are you staying at this hotel too?

101
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,520
You're here to soak in hot springs too?

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,520
To relax for a bit.

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
My boss asked me to book a hotel,

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
so I booked this one.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
Looks like we're quite like-minded.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,680
We have similar tastes.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
That's right.

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
This hotel

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,880
was designed by a Japanese designer.

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,280
And the hot springs here

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,880
are very well-known.

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
It's a top choice amongst

113
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,440
tourists in this area.

114
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,640
I see.

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,640
Come join me.

116
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,240
Okay.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,640
Be careful.

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Sister Wen Wen, have some.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm good. You can have it.

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
By the way, Sister Wen Wen,

121
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
are you a professional photographer?

122
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,680
I used to be a photo-journalist.

123
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,520
And then I worked as a part-time photographer

124
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,080
for National Geographic.

125
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,960
I only began working full-time these years.

126
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,880
But it's so rare to see female photographers.

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,280
You must have been to many places.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
I've been to every place

129
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
you can think of.

130
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
Recently, my husband began to focus on

131
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
the domestic market.

132
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,760
So I followed him

133
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,520
and came back.

134
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,600
You got married at such a young age?

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
I won't say I'm still young.

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,880
I just got engaged this year.

137
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm waiting for my photography exhibition
to finish

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,080
so that I can have my wedding at the end of this year.

139
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,320
How about you? What do you do for a living?

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
Me?

141
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm currently working at

142
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,920
an architectural company.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,440
An architectural designer?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,680
No, no, no.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
My dream is to be an architectural designer.

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,040
But for now, I'm just

147
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,120
an assistant to my boss.

148
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,640
Still in the process of learning.

149
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,320
Our boss is

150
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
a really, really good architectural designer.

151
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,400
He has won

152
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,080
a lot of international awards at a young age.

153
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
He's handsome and talented.

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,400
Anyway,

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
he's just so outstanding.

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,920
Super brilliant.

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
Such a boss...

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
Must be quite strict, right?

159
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
He used to always

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,800
pull a long face at first.

161
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,880
But now he smiles at me from time to time.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
He's the kind of person who would look

163
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,600
super handsome when he smiles.

164
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
You like him?

165
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
How do you know?

166
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,280
I mean...

167
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,480
I mean, what made you

168
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,480
ask such a question?

169
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,600
Because you only answered my question

170
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,680
in one sentence, but

171
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,160
you spent the rest of the time praising him.

172
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,280
I just look up to him.

173
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,080
That's all.

174
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,040
I don't have feelings for him.

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
No feelings at all.

176
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm not an employee of your company.

177
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,560
You don't need to be so nervous.

178
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,960
Is it very obvious?

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Very obvious.

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
You're not someone

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
who can lie after all.

182
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,960
If it's so obvious,

183
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,400
what if my boss

184
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,440
could tell from long ago?

185
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
I just drank a little

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,280
and I am talking too much now.

187
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,840
(I'm done sorting out the proposal.)

188
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
(Do you want to come over and have a look?)

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,000
(Sure, you can send it to me.)

190
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
(The proposal is on my laptop.)

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
(How about I bring it over to you?)

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,600
(Never mind. I'll go over.)

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
You're right.

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Since you and I

195
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
are just strangers,

196
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm not afraid to tell you.

197
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,000
Actually, it's really hard for me

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
to not like him.

199
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
Although he appears to be

200
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,640
quite cold normally,

201
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,800
he's always the first one

202
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,120
to appear

203
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
when I need help.

204
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,760
And he does it very naturally,

205
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,240
as if

206
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,240
it was just a coincidence.

207
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,600
You'll never expect

208
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
that he did it intentionally.

209
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,560
He is someone

210
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,800
who shines so brightly

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
wherever he goes.

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
When you're talking about your boss,

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you really did go on and on.

214
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,000
Looks like you're really into him.

215
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,200
We just met.

216
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
And I've talked a lot already.

217
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,240
I feel a bit embarrassed.

218
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,840
I didn't even ask you if you want to hear it.

219
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,600
It's okay.

220
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,040
I understand.

221
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,480
Sometimes,

222
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
it's easier to talk openly

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
to someone you don't really know.

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400
You speak so highly

225
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
of this man,

226
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
even I want to get to know him.

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll introduce him

228
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
to you later,

229
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
but

230
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,080
you must keep

231
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,480
what I told you tonight as a secret.

232
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
You don't need to. I was kidding.

233
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,520
It wouldn't really matter

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,040
whether I meet him or not.

235
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,720
One day

236
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
you'll learn

237
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,960
you can run out of curiosity.

238
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
Okay, I can't stay in any longer.

239
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

240
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,960
By the way,

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,600
I still want to remind you.

242
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
Be careful when you're falling in love
with your boss.

243
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
Be careful not to lose your love

244
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
and your job.

245
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,600
Got it.

246
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,560
I only admire him.

247
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,280
I have no other intentions.

248
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm leaving.

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
I'll send you the photos later.

250
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,200
Okay.

251
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,040
See you.

252
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,360
Bye-bye.

253
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,040
Bye-bye.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,480
Okay.

255
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Then send it to me.

256
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,720
Who is it?

257
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,320
Gu Chuan.

258
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,920
Mr. Gu, the proposal is on my laptop.

259
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,040
I've left it on the table.

260
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Please come in and get it.

261
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,760
Mr. Gu,

262
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
this proposal is quite urgent.

263
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,040
I suggest that you review it

264
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,760
while I amend it concurrently.

265
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
It's more efficient this way.

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,240
It's okay.

267
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
I can amend it myself

268
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
after I'm done reviewing it.

269
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,760
Mr. Gu,

270
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,800
I have a question to ask you.

271
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,240
What is it?

272
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Were you so busy working on the proposal

273
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,440
this entire time in your room

274
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
that you didn't even leave yourself

275
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,800
any time to get changed?

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
What's wrong?

277
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
All these years,

278
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,080
I've never seen you

279
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
relax.

280
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,920
It's like you're constantly

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
preparing for war.

282
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,760
Mr. Gu,

283
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
you're already very exceptional.

284
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
You're a top-notch architectural designer
in our industry.

285
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,760
Do you have to be number one?

286
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,840
I have never

287
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,200
competed with anyone.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm just trying to

289
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,320
accomplish my own goals.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,560
Apart from winning the Jin An Award,

291
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,240
do you have any other plans?

292
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Acting mysterious.

293
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,120
Haven't I always been like this?

294
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,160
You've changed a lot recently.

295
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,600
You've become more bubbly

296
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,640
and you like to smile now.

297
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,280
Is it because of Jiang Xiao Ning?

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
Perhaps.

299
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,720
Looking at her

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
reminds me of myself

301
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,400
when I first got into the company.

302
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,440
I was about the same as her.

303
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
I was a fresh and inexperienced graduate,

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,120
running around

305
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,160
every day.

306
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,960
I seemed to have endless energy.

307
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,960
Chasing after you every day

308
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
with tons of questions.

309
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
Even messed up a lot of stuff.

310
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
But

311
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,800
it seems that I didn't

312
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,000
bring you that much joy.

313
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
You know that

314
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm a pessimistic person.

315
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,360
I will always

316
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,280
prepare for the worst.

317
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,240
But Jiang Xiao Ning is the opposite of me.

318
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,840
I can feel an extremely strong

319
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,800
sense of optimism from her.

320
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
No matter how bad things get,

321
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,200
she can always turn it around.

322
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,520
For example,

323
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,440
I like to cut to the chase.

324
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
However,

325
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
she likes to enjoy the process.

326
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,840
I like living my life

327
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
according to my own plan,

328
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
realizing it step by step.

329
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,080
But she

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,280
is like an alarm

331
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,520
that won't stop going off.

332
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
And she makes everyone around her

333
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
extremely enthusiastic as well.

334
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,920
You could say that she's the opposite of me

335
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,560
in every way.

336
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
It's quite interesting.

337
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,360
Then do you like her?

338
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,080
In what way?

339
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,640
Romantically.

340
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,320
They came out.

341
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,680
The moon and stars are all out.

342
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
I don't think I'll fall in love

343
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,880
with anyone.

344
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,880
Okay, rest early.

345
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,200
I'll go back to review the proposal.

346
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Jiang Xiao Ning, where did you go just now?

347
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,840
I went to soak in the hot springs

348
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
with a friend I just met.

349
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,440
Then the moon came out.

350
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,839
I'll head back first.

351
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,800
Boss, Sister Man Lin,

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
let me know if you need anything.

353
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,839
I'll head back as well.

354
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,200
Boss and Sister Man Lin

355
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,720
must be discussing work.

356
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,480
But if they were discussing work,

357
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,200
why would Sister Man Lin

358
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,440
wear such sexy sleepwear?

359
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,040
She's a born beauty,

360
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,200
while you're destined to be normal.

361
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,200
After waiting for so long,

362
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,320
the clouds have finally gone.

363
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Why are you sighing

364
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,280
over there

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,440
when you've got what you wanted?

366
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Boss,

367
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,320
you showed up out of nowhere.

368
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,600
It's you who was

369
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
too immersed in your own world.

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Jiang Xiao Ning,

371
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,000
I think you're quite something.

372
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
A lot of things become miracles

373
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,520
the moment they encounter you.

374
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
You have to believe it to see it.

375
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,720
Indeed.

376
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,920
The moon is quite pretty.

377
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
I told you so.

378
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Okay.

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
You've seen the moon.

380
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Now you should go back and rest.

381
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
How about you, Boss?

382
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
I still need to work.

383
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,360
Su Man Lin just gave me

384
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
some proposal to read.

385
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,840
I need to check it through one more time.

386
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Do you need my help?

387
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,720
The only thing you can help me with now

388
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,680
is to get inside and rest.

389
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,920
Goodnight, Boss.

390
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,120
Goodnight, Boss.

391
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,480
Goodnight.

392
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,240
Was Boss giving me an explanation?

393
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,400
Was he? Was he?

394
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,520
Doesn't matter.

395
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,840
I'll take it as an explanation.

396
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,120
They really were discussing work.

397
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,040
Jiang Xiao Ning,

398
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,600
how could you misunderstand your boss?

399
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Is there something wrong with your brain?

400
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm working. Why are you here again?

401
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,560
I missed you, so I came to see you.

402
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,520
Didn't I tell you

403
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,920
that we should just be friends?

404
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,680
You did.

405
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm giving you

406
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,400
these flowers as a friend.

407
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,360
Lilies.

408
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,040
So you will treat me as your mother now?

409
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Thank you, friend.

410
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,560
Goodbye, friend.

411
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
I don't have much to do.

412
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,440
But I do.

413
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,280
What do you have to do?

414
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
Why should I tell you?

415
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,840
Zhao Yan.

416
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,920
What's going on?

417
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,280
Who is this?

418
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,720
My cousin.

419
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,600
Cousin?

420
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh, your cousin.

421
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Hello, cousin.

422
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,240
Hello.

423
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,960
Alright, I'll wait for you at the restaurant.

424
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Okay.

425
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,240
Oh, by the way,

426
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,200
if you're free,

427
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
you can join us.

428
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,920
Who was that?

429
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
Why did you say I'm your cousin?

430
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,280
Your company doesn't allow

431
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,600
their employees to date?

432
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
Since you've already met him,

433
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,240
I'll tell you the truth then.

434
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,000
My boyfriend.

435
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,920
What did you mean by that?

436
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm still too young.

437
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
Almost fell for it.

438
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,640
I don't believe you'll choose someone like that

439
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,560
to be your boyfriend.

440
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,360
Believe it or not. It's up to you.

441
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,920
I've already told you.

442
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
Don't think you can trick me into leaving

443
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:43,960
by using some

444
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,000
random person as an excuse.

445
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,320
I don't need to trick you.

446
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
Do you think I'm three?

447
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,960
You expect me to believe you're dating

448
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,280
a greasy middle-aged man like him?

449
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,560
Manager Wei.

450
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,240
You're here, Yan Yan.

451
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,840
Where's your cousin?

452
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,840
He was just dropping something off.

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,760
He left already.

454
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,160
Okay.

455
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Close the door and sit.

456
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,480
Originally,

457
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,640
I planned on having your cousin join us.

458
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,280
Is he your boyfriend?

459
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,920
No.

460
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,680
It's not a big deal.

461
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,400
We're in the 21st century.

462
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
We're all adults.

463
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,640
It won't affect anything.

464
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,480
It won't.

465
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,040
Come on.

466
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,080
Are we really drinking at noon?

467
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
What's the matter?

468
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,280
I'll call the company

469
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,200
and tell them that

470
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,200
we're doing fieldwork together.

471
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
Then,

472
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,400
on this beautiful afternoon,

473
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,440
let's find a hotel

474
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,800
and enjoy our downtime together.

475
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,960
When it's time,

476
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,800
we'll "clock off" and head back to our own places.

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
No one will be affected.

478
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,200
Sir, you can't do this.

479
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,240
I apologize

480
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,040
for interrupting.

481
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,520
Is this your friend?

482
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,280
Cousin!

483
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,480
We know each other.

484
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,360
You can leave the room now.

485
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,720
I was looking for you.

486
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,800
Come on. Take a seat

487
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,120
Your appearance says that you're a boss.

488
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,200
How should I address you?

489
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,240
Here's to you.

490
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,680
It's just a name.

491
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
Call me brother-in-law.

492
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,680
Sister.

493
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
Brother-in-law.

494
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,000
Here's to you, brother-in-law.

495
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,440
Look at your cousin.

496
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,600
So polite and knows the ways of the world.

497
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Cheers, cousin.

498
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,040
Cousin?

499
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
You're the cousin.

500
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
Your whole family is cousins!

501
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,320
Stop it, Xu Cheng Ran!

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,960
What are you doing?

503
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,760
Let go!

504
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,600
Let go!

505
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,800
Stop!

506
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,920
Crazy.

507
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,160
Get up.

508
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,800
Get up.

509
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,320
Manager Wei, are you alright?

510
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,680
Let's go.

511
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,200
Are you crazy!

512
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,240
I am.

513
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,280
I just wanted to test

514
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,840
if I'll be able to

515
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,760
act crazy for you this one time.

516
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,440
Are you done testing?

517
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,240
If you're done, just leave.

518
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,080
I just have one question.

519
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
Why did you pick someone like him

520
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,040
over me?

521
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Because he's better than you.

522
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,880
I didn't see that.

523
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,000
You have to look deeply into his inner self.

524
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
My inner self is outstanding too.

525
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
The you right now is clearly not outstanding.

526
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,360
That's because

527
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
you said he's better than me.

528
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,240
You're just getting worse if you
keep acting like this.

529
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,840
Leave.

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,040

My Chuan,

560
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
where are you?

561
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
Chuan.

562
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,760
Next time, can you come find me

563
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,800
when you're sober?

564
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,200
I'm in so much pain.

565
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,720
Can you see?

566
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,120
See what?

567
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,800
My heart

568
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,320
is broken.

569
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,440
I see your moral integrity

570
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,520
has shattered into pieces.

571
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
You're not wrong.

572
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,840
But why did Yan Yan do that?

573
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,640
We have already

574
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,800
done everything.

575
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,640
Why did she change

576
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
her attitude all of a sudden?

577
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
Or,

578
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
she just wanted my body?

579
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,280
I really don't want to talk to you.

580
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,960
You're so gross.

581
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,160
Do whatever you want.

582
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,200
I'm going to sleep.

583
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,600
Don't leave. Chat with me.

584
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm so sad that I want to die.

585
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,720
You're so sad that you want to die?

586
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Then die.

587
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm not going to stop you.

588
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,760
You're right.

589
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,960
I'll go die.

590
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
When he left me there

591
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,880
alone,

592
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,760
I was in shock.

593
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
The palms of my hands started to hurt.

594
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,200
I hope

595
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,760
he's not actually mad at me.

596
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,640
What should I do?

597
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm just terrified

598
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,680
to build this relationship with him.

599
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,520
What are you scared of?

600
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,440
Have you watched this movie

601
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,400
called

602
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,560
"Memories of Matsuko"?

603
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,640
Nope.

604
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
I apologize

605
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,960
for being born as a human.

606
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
What are you talking about?

607
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,800
A quote from the movie.

608
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,080
The leading female character

609
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,920
grew up without her father's love.

610
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,800
She became this person

611
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,040
who desperately wanted to be

612
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,520
loved by others.

613
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,760
I don't want to be that kind of person.

614
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,320
I can live happily

615
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
by myself.

616
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,080
I don't need love.

617
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,320
In my opinion,

618
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,320
you really hurt him this time.

619
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,000
Do you not regret it?

620
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,720
You know.

621
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,840
I originally thought that

622
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,960
he's one of those playboys

623
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,440
who could cut things off easily.

624
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,680
I didn't expect him

625
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,120
to be this serious.

626
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,520
You're right.

627
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,240
It does not feel good

628
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,640
to act so carefully

629
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,840
and to be so afraid of

630
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
losing someone.

631
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,680
Xiao Ning,

632
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,160
I need to warn you.

633
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Are you still going to

634
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,240
have this crush on your boss?

635
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt.

636
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
Sometimes,

637
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
it's good to keep a distance.

638
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,200
Should we keep a distance?

639
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,880
Why are you so quiet today?

640
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm not, Boss.

641
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm trying to focus on driving.

642
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,240
I still need to warn you.

643
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,040
You need to think it through

644
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,440
whether you still want to

645
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
have this crush on your boss.

646
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
Sometimes, keeping a distance

647
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
might be a good thing.

648
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,720
(We are indeed from two different worlds.)

649
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Is this what you refer to as focusing on driving?

650
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,360
I'm sorry, Boss.

651
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,480
I'll drive slowly.

652
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,240
What did you do last night?

653
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,600
I

654
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,400
drank a little with Sister Yan Yan.

655
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,240
Are you sober now?

656
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm sober.

657
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,680
Jiang Xiao Ning,

658
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,040
I hope that you can focus

659
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,120
when you're working.

660
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,240
Do you hear me?

661
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,280
Yes.

662
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,680
I'm sorry, Boss.

663
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
(Now, it looks like)

664
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,720
(they're from the same world.)

665
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,740
(Chen Wen Wen)

666
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,120
Sister Wen Wen,

667
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
I saw the pictures

668
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,280
you sent me.

669
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,560
It's wonderful.

670
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,000
How can I show my appreciation?

671
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,720
If you really want to thank me,

672
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,360
help me design my photography exhibition.

673
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,720
Me?

674
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,320
I would love to,

675
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,240
but I'm still an assistant.

676
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm not qualified.

677
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
What about recommending

678
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
a professional designer to you?

679
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,840
Sure.

680
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
Help me set up an appointment

681
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,200
with a designer

682
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,000
and have them come over.

683
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,200
I'll send you the address.

684
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,520
Okay.

685
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Come on in.

686
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,520
You sober?

687
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Boss,

688
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm not an alcoholic.

689
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,840
How can I not be sober

690
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,160
at this time?

691
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,160
So,

692
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,000
what is it?

693
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,000
Do you remember

694
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,680
the photographer

695
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,960
I told you about last time?

696
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
She's going to hold a photography exhibition

697
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,840
and she wants our company to help her design it.

698
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,480
Sure.

699
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
Just talk to Su Man Lin.

700
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,840
Why Sister Man Lin?

701
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,760
She's responsible for

702
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
all the arts-related projects

703
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,480
in the company,

704
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,640
including

705
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,440
that art gallery project

706
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,400
from before.

707
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,200
What?

708
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,400
Is there a problem?

709
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,400
No.

710
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,840
It's just

711
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,760
I spoke highly of you

712
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,120
in front of her.

713
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,600
I said you're extremely talented,

714
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,360
elegant, handsome.

715
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,760
Definitely a top-notch designer in the industry.

716
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,320
If you can't go,

717
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
I'm afraid that she'll be disappointed.

718
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
Go to Su Man Lin.

719
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
She can definitely handle it.

720
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,320
Okay.

721
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,760
I'll leave then.

722
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,060
(Transaction completed)

723
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,560
Hello?

724
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,560
Mr. Xu.

725
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,360
The money has been transferred.

726
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,719
I transferred the construction payment

727
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,679
from before to...

728
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,120
Alright.

729
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't need the details,

730
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
as long as it has been done.

731
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,159
But the numbers on the book

732
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,159
are really different.

733
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,320
If someone checks it,

734
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
they'll know for sure.

735
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,239
I'm worried...

736
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,239
No need to worry.

737
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Even if someone does check,

738
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,920
they'll never know it's you.

739
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,960
Besides,

740
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm here, aren't I?

741
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,320
Understood.

742
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,480
Alright.

743
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,360
Don't overthink it.

744
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,760
Thank you for having so much faith in me.

745
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,400
Why are you still

746
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,239
so polite with me

747
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,840
after all these years?

748
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't forget to

749
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,800
come here to have a meal with me

750
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,560
this weekend.

751
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,719
Yes.

752
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,040
Good.

753
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,400
Hi, Brother Xu.

754
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,080
Xiao Ning,

755
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
I'll go pick you up tonight.

756
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,960
Let's go watch a movie together.

757
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm still at work.

758
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,680
Not sure about the plans for the evening yet.

759
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
Okay, I'll let you go then.

760
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,280
Alright, we'll talk later.

761
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,080
Let's go another time.

762
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm hanging up.

763
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,320
Jiang Xiao Ning.

764
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,840
When did you start

765
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,760
reporting directly to Mr. Gu

766
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,640
about projects?

767
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,640
I... I didn't.

768
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,080
This photography exhibition project.

769
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,920
Didn't you go over my head

770
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,280
and report it to Mr. Gu directly?

771
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,680
I'm sorry, Sister Man Lin.

772
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
I didn't think it through.

773
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,720
Think more before you act next time.

774
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,800
Let's go.

775
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
Sister Wen Wen.

776
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
Sorry you had to wait.

777
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,640
No problem.

778
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,400
This is the Vice President

779
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,360
and Design Director,

780
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,280
Su Man Lin.

781
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,360
Sister Man Lin,

782
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,480
this is my friend.

783
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,880
A photographer, Chen Wen Wen.

784
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,360
Turning this space

785
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,680
into an exhibition hall

786
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
is a nice idea.

787
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,160
The view is unobstructed

788
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,160
and the space is large enough.

789
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,200
More importantly, the price is reasonable.

790
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,920
However,

791
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,840
it might be a little difficult to construct.

792
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
Transportation of materials will be
a problem too.

793
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
And we're not sure if

794
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,920
it'll take a long time

795
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,840
to receive approval.

796
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,920
That's not a problem.

797
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,880
I've got time.

798
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm just thinking...

799
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,280
It'll be impossible for

800
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,320
the entire space to be used for the exhibition.

801
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,280
That's fine. Half will be enough.

802
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,040
Even half will be too much.

803
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,640
My advice is

804
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
to make a third into indoor space

805
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
and make the rest

806
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,360
into a resting area.

807
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,640
Then integrate some landscaping

808
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,280
into the exhibition area.

809
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,680
I don't think that's a good idea.

810
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,000
Landscaping...

811
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
The addition of garden design

812
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,960
will liven up the atmosphere

813
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,800
of this rooftop.

814
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,320
Otherwise,

815
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,160
this rooftop

816
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,880
will be no different from

817
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
other rooftops in the CBD.
(*Short for Central Business District)

818
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
But I prefer

819
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,200
this open and boundless feeling.

820
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Let me put it this way.

821
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,120
The purpose of accepting smaller-scaled,

822
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,040
arts-related projects like this

823
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,600
is not to

824
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,840
make a profit,

825
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,640
but to accumulate work

826
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,880
to get nominated for awards.

827
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
So, I urge you

828
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,720
to trust our professional

829
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
artistic vision.

830
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,120
We will definitely help you

831
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,400
attract people's attention.

832
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,320
Alright.

833
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,360
Let me think about it.

834
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
Do you have

835
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,560
any similar design plans

836
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,680
I could refer to?

837
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,920
Of course.

838
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,960
Please come to our office tomorrow.

839
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
I can explain everything

840
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,320
to you in detail.

841
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,280
Sure.

842
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,520
I'll go take a look.

843
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,720
Xiao Ning,

844
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
let's have dinner together.

845
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm not off work yet.

846
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,840
It's after

847
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
business hours already.

848
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,320
Why are you looking at me?

849
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,600
It's up to you.

850
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,320
When you've made your decision,

851
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
please let Jiang Xiao Ning contact me.

852
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,040
I'll leave first.

853
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,520
Sister Man Lin, take care.

854
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,560
Sorry, Sister Wen Wen,

855
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,280
I thought too highly of myself.

856
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,720
I thought I could let

857
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,240
Boss handle your project himself.

858
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,600
As long as my requirements can be met,

859
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,920
it doesn't matter who will be designing it.

860
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,000
But I feel like

861
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,400
your Vice President

862
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,840
doesn't like you much.

863
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
The reason Sister Man Lin

864
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,360
got angry could be

865
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
because I went over her head

866
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
and reported to Boss directly.

867
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,080
It was my fault.

868
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,160
You really think

869
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
she's angry because you went over her head?

870
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,960
What else?

871
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,880
You said so yourself.

872
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,720
No girl

873
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,040
would not like

874
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,480
someone as exceptional

875
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,520
as your boss.

876
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,120
Maybe she's mad because

877
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
you're too close to your boss?

878
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,880
Do you think so?

879
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm just guessing.

880
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,040
Sister Wen Wen,

881
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,760
how could you know so much about relationships?

882
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,560
Sometimes,

883
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,360
a heart-breaking experience

884
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,080
will make you grow up.

885
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,520
So I envy you

886
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,240
for having someone you like so much.

887
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,680
Cherish it.

888
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,040
Don't wait until you miss it

889
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,400
to regret it.

890
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,400
I do want to cherish it,

891
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
but I don't even have the courage

892
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
to make a love confession.

893
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,200
How come?

894
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
Like one of my older sisters said,

895
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,640
Boss and I

896
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,320
grew up in different environments

897
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,800
We have different life experiences.

898
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,440
Not to mention our outlooks and horizons.

899
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,440
This is not

900
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,240
the Jiang Xiao Ning I know.

901
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,840
Being in love with someone.

902
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,240
You need to have trust first

903
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,480
and then the courage.

904
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,360
Aren’t you

905
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,640
a courageous person?

906
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,240
But you said yourself.

907
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,200
One has to be careful when falling
in love with their bosses?

908
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,800
Love always comes first.

909
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Just eat first.

910
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,120
(If you're drinking again tonight,)

911
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
(don't come to pick me up tomorrow.)

912
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,840
(I told you I'm not an alcoholic.)

913
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,080
(I'm already getting ready for bed.)

914
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,160
(Good night, Boss.)

915
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,280
Sister Wen Wen.

916
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,040
Xiao Ning.

917
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,760
This way, please.

918
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,320
Okay.
