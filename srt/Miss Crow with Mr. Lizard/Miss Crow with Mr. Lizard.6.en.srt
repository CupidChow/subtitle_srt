Eh? How did I fall asleep
at my boss's place?

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
Director Xu,

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,040
you're up early.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,920
Have a seat.

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Why not sleep in?

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,280
I'd love to, but I can't fall asleep.

27
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm too used to working.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,440
Where's your brother?

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,840
He...

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,840
I don't know.

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,480
I haven't seen him lately.

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,000
He must be occupied.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,240
By the way,

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
your dad will be released soon.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm talking about Tang Zheng Cheng.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
I know.

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
It's been a long time since we last talked.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,200
That's not good.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,320
After all,

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
he's your father.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
You ought to do

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
what a son does.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
He's my biological father,

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
so by right, I should visit him.

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
But he's also the one

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
who destroyed my life.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,440
I know how you feel.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
I watched you grow up

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
and be more and more mature

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,640
all these years.

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,320
I know you're not

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
someone cold-blooded.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,000
Your moral standard

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
and competence are commendable.

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,520
And deep down,

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
I regard you as my son.

58
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Thanks, Director Xu.

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,360
I will deal with

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
the matter properly.

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
Good.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Also,

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,640
have you heard of Hua Zhou Corporation?

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
A subsidiary of mine.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
It's not a big corporation

66
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,840
but if you're willing to put in some effort,

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
it will show potentials.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
In fact,

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,280
I sincerely hope that

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,680
you can prove yourself

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,120
in front of the directors as soon as possible.

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
So from now onwards,

73
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
I'll let you handle

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,600
this company.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
Show me what you can do

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
and do it well.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
I will do my best.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
Don't let me down, okay?

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,280
Don't worry.

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Dig in.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
(Thank you for letting me stay over.)

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,400
(I fell asleep accidentally yesterday.)

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
(Rest well. See you!)

86
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
Morning, Chuan.

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
Breakfast time!

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
I've been starving.

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,960
What happened to your hand?

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Show me.

91
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
It's nothing.

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
I just took a tumble.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Jiang Xiao Ning!

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
You know that

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,760
you're

96
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
insensitive to pain.

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,200
If you're injured,

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,800
you know,

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
you might die!

100
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,200
I know, my dearest aunt.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
Time to have breakfast.

102
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
Did your grandma do anything stupid

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
lately?

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
No, she didn't.

105
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
She kept praising my

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,280
culinary skill.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,280
So you want to take my place?

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,080
Hell no.

109
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,840
Just you wait

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
until I'm fully recovered,

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,240
then we'll have a cook-off.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,040
I will defeat you in seconds.

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,320
Yes, boss?

114
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
It's me, Xu Cheng Ran.

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
Morning, Mr. Xu.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,920
I told Gu Chuan that

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
I wanted to have a hot pot

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
at his place this noon.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
Can you get some ingredients here?

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,120
Will do.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,920
You came early today.

122
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,520
It's time for your medication.

123
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
Uhm,

124
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
I have to go to work soon.

125
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
Can you look after my aunt?

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
No worries. Go do your stuff.

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,320
Leave it to me.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,560
Okay.

129
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
I'll go now.

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Will you be here at night?

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,040
I will.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,520
Her arm is injured

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
and yet you're ordering her around.

134
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Feeling protective?

135
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
Seems like Jiang Xiao Ning

136
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
is someone special.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Why are you here this early in the morning?

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Well, I care a lot about you.

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,920
So I came to visit you

141
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
after I woke up.

142
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
Who would have thought that

143
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
I'd arrive at a crime scene?

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
What crime scene?

145
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,080
A girl,

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
staying overnight at your place,

147
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
even wearing your clothes.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
I never got such treatment from you.

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,800
It's good.

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,360
It means you've grown up, Chuan.

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,840
You know about my situation.

152
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
Nothing good comes from it.

153
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
Having emotion is good

154
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,520
and I know

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
someone like Jiang Xiao Ning

156
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
is not your type.

157
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
And your point is?

158
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,240
So,

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
I don't care

160
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
if you're just being sympathetic

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
or whatever,

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,920
mingling with humans,

163
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,040
showing emotions,

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
they do you good.

165
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
After all, you can't be

166
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
as cold-blooded as

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,280
your lizard pet, right?

168
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
That's not cute.

169
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
Xiao Xu.

170
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
It's been a long time.

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
How are you? Good?

172
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Not bad.

173
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Just very busy.

174
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
That's good then.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
By the way,

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
I will be released soon.

177
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
When I'm out,

178
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
we will be reunited.

179
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,160
Also,

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,680
is uncle Xu treating you well?

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
He's very kind.

182
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
He treats me as if I'm his son.

183
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
He can entrust

184
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,280
everything to me,

185
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,040
including his company.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
That's great.

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,600
However,

188
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
you should judge

189
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
what's right or wrong yourself.

190
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay?

191
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't just

192
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
believe what he said blindly.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,480
Don't be blinded by money.

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,360
Okay?

195
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,760
He didn't buy me with money.

196
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,040
He cares about me.

197
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
He keeps me company.

198
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
I chose to believe

199
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,360
and accept him with all my heart

200
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
because at least,

201
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
he's not a criminal.

202
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,400
He didn't kill my mom.

203
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,800
He didn't destroy my life.

204
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
I need to leave now.

205
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Take care.

206
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,400
Coming!

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
Hi, Mr. Xu.

208
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Not bad, Jiang Xiao Ning.

209
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,840
You're good at shopping.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

211
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll take my leave now.

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Come back here.

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,160
Anything else?

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,960
Mr. Gu said that

215
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,160
we should eat together.

216
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,920
No need to gawk.

217
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
Close the door. Change your shoes.

218
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,520
Come in.

219
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Seems like you're fully recovered.

220
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,080
You look spirited today.

221
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Well,

222
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,600
I can't feel pain.

223
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,120
Are you Deadpool then?

224
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Super regeneration, insensitivity to pain.

225
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Something like that.

226
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,040
By the way, where's Mr. Gu?

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,160
Drawing upstairs.

228
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,320
As you know,

229
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
a designer doesn't deserve any break,

230
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
friendship, and relationship.

231
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
When you become a designer in the future,

232
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
you'll start losing hair too.

233
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,600
Seriously?

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,880
Now that you're here,

235
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
let me give you one task.

236
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
From now onwards,

237
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,000
spend as much time as possible with Gu Chuan.

238
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,800
You're his assistant,

239
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
so keep an eye on him for me.

240
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,720
Twenty-four-hour surveillance.

241
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,200
It would be better if you can live here.

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,280
Report to me

243
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
whenever something happens.

244
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
But why?

245
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
It's as if we're spying on Mr. Gu.

246
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,720
He's not a 3-year-old kid.

247
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,120
He's worse than a 3-year-old kid,

248
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,480
okay?

249
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,600
His destructive power...

250
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,520
Is Mr. Gu that childish?

251
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
When he gets agitated,

252
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,920
he might...

253
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,680
Just imagine,

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
a workaholic

255
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
designer,

256
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,560
when he goes nuts,

257
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,600
it'll be very scary.

258
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,640
How scary?

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
You cannot understand anyway.

260
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Just do what I asked you to.

261
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Keep an eye on Gu Chuan.

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,720
I will not allow him to do

263
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,200
anything that betrays me.

264
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,440
Don't worry.

265
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
If you do it well, I'll give you a raise.

266
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,520
Okay.

267
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,400
What should

268
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,120
I do first?

269
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,320
First,

270
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
add me on WeChat.

271
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Done.

272
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Secondly,

273
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,640
prepare the hot pot. I'm hungry.

274
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
What about Mr. Gu?

275
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
I don't care. I'm hungry.

276
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,880
All right, Mr. Xu.

277
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Mr. Xu.

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,760
We don't have the pot for hot pot.

279
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,960
No pot?

280
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll go buy it then.

281
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,120
I need to take care of something too.

282
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay.

283
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Keep an eye on Gu Chuan.

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,640
Yes, Mr. Xu.

285
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,040
Hi, boss.

286
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,640
Mr. Xu just left.

287
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
Have you had lunch?

288
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,200
Not yet.

289
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,600
Mr. Xu asked me to buy the ingredients

290
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,640
for the hot pot.

291
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
He likes hot pot

292
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
but I don't like the smell of it

293
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,360
and

294
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,320
I don't have the things you need for a hot pot here.

295
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,000
Well,

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,960
Mr. Xu said that he'd buy it.

297
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,240
He'll come back after he's done with his business.

298
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
It's fine. He won't die from starvation.

299
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,320
By the way,

300
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,640
are you feeling better now?

301
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,280
You weren't feeling well yesterday.

302
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm fine now.

303
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,480
Boss,

304
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,000
since you're not fully recovered yet,

305
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
if you don't mind,

306
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,080
I can cook something for you.

307
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
You know how to cook?

308
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,040
Of course.

309
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm a good cook.

310
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,200
So organized.

311
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Do you have OCD?

312
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Nothing.

313
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
Just rest, boss.

314
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,960
I'll manage.

315
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Mingling with humans,

316
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,840
showing emotions,

317
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,040
they do you good.

318
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,280
After all, you can't be

319
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,040
as cold-blooded as

320
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,840
your lizard pet, right?

321
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,080
That's not cute.

322
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,120
(You asked my assistant to cook.)

323
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,080
(Where are you then?)

324
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
(I wouldn't want to be the third wheel.)

325
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
(I'll come back later.)

326
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
(Are you that bored?)

327
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,760
(Don't ever come back then.)

328
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,200
(Sure.)

329
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,160
(Have fun. Don't fight.)

330
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
(Wall-painting is fun with good company)

331
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
God is helping me this time.

332
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,360
Manager Wei.

333
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,280
Come in.

334
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,320
Can you

335
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
sign this leave notice for me?

336
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,360
What for?

337
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Personal matter.

338
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,320
But I'll return real quick.

339
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Zhao Yan.

340
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
You want to leave

341
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,360
during office hours for a personal matter.

342
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,280
I have to refuse.

343
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,880
Manager Wei,

344
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,319
it's something urgent.

345
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,520
I can say yes

346
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,520
to your request now,

347
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,359
but why do you always say no

348
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
whenever I invite you

349
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
to a gathering?

350
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm sorry, Manager Wei.

351
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll come to the department dinner

352
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,440
next time.

353
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,119
Willing to change is a good thing.

354
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
That's right.

355
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
We should spend more time together.

356
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
The more, the merrier.

357
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Thanks, Manager Wei.

358
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,400
Boss, can you come here?

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
What's up?

360
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,320
Over here, this side.

361
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,480
Can you help me, Boss?

362
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,120
Help me

363
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,040
to...

364
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,720
I just want you

365
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,080
to take the dishes out.

366
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm going to call Xu Cheng Ran

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and tell him that dinner's ready.

368
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
(How did that happen?)

369
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,840
(It shouldn't happen.)

370
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,160
Boss!

371
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,240
Dinner's ready.

372
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,920
Boss,

373
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
you have a particular taste.

374
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,560
When it comes to pets,

375
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,480
others prefer cats or dogs.

376
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
Why do you keep a pet lizard then?

377
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,960
Lizard is low maintenance.

378
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
A dog

379
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,240
will wait for you by the door every day.

380
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
A cat

381
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,120
requires high maintenance.

382
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,360
But a lizard...

383
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,600
Even though

384
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,960
we share the same living space,

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,080
we

386
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,360
don't bother each other.

387
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,040
Yes,

388
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
you're right.

389
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,560
This one, where?

390
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,320
This one...

391
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,120
Excuse me miss, do you have time?

392
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,560
Sorry, busy.

393
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,080
It's a paid survey.

394
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,640
If you take it,

395
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,240
you'll get a red envelope

396
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,320
as a token of appreciation.

397
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
I just transferred 1,000 RMB to you.

398
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,320
(Female's perception of society)
What kind of survey is this?

399
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,800
It's about females' opinions

400
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,320
regarding certain problems.

401
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,840
Are you single?

402
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,840
Yes.

403
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
Are you looking for anything particular
in your spouse?

404
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm not

405
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,440
seeing anyone at the moment.

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
I keep my options open

407
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,920
and I'll see.

408
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,320
Any criteria are you looking for

409
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
in your future spouse?

410
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,000
Male.

411
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,520
Responsible.

412
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Emotionally stable.

413
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,040
I don't care about income.

414
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,480
Respect women.

415
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
What about the height, the weight,

416
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,520
the age, and the appearance?

417
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,800
What about these?

418
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,080
Decent-looking at least.

419
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Can't be fat.

420
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,320
Athletic.

421
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,440
Big.

422
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,760
Big?

423
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm talking about age.

424
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,560
Anything else?

425
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
What would make you

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,720
fall in love with someone?

427
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,320
Isn't this

428
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,120
the same question?

429
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,840
Are your questions

430
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
going to be repetitive?

431
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,000
Sorry.

432
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
The survey is over.

433
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Thank you.

434
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,600
Have a nice day.

435
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,480
Show me the receipt number.

436
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,560
I thought

437
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,760
you were some sort of con artist.

438
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,800
No need for that.

439
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks a lot.

440
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I actually earned some money.

441
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,920
See you!

442
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,800
Hey,

443
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I'd like to take the survey too.

444
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Sorry,

445
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,000
it's over.

446
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,680
It's over.

447
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,480
My shift is over.

448
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:20,960
Dude!

449
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,200
Weird.

450
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,920
Yan Yan.

451
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,480
Sorry, I'm late.

452
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,280
It's fine.

453
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,400
Your drinks, sir.

454
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,600
Enjoy.

455
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't know what you like

456
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
so I ordered everything.

457
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,120
What a corny gesture that only worked

458
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
ten years ago.

459
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm on my period

460
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,200
so I prefer warm water.

461
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,200
Boss.

462
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,120
Careful. Hot.

463
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you like it?

464
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,760
Not bad.

465
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,560
That's a relief.

466
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
Eat some too.

467
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,480
Shouldn't we wait for Mr. Xu?

468
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,080
No need to wait for him.

469
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,720
Xiao Chuan.

470
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
Are you home?

471
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
The past few days

472
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,320
feel like dreams.

473
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,360
Why do you dream so often?

474
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,560
How do you know?

475
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,200
I dream every night.

476
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,040
I mean

477
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,480
I'm really grateful that you protected me that day.

478
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,880
I don't usually have good luck,

479
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,920
but whenever I'm in danger,

480
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,240
someone's there to help me.

481
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,880
When I was younger,

482
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,640
I was in a worse situation than that day.

483
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,720
But back then, a boy

484
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,600
helped me.

485
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,160
However...

486
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
However what?

487
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,280
It was dark back then

488
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,680
so I couldn't see his face properly.

489
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
It happened years ago

490
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,680
so my memory of it is getting blurry too.

491
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,400
I don't know

492
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,680
if he's still here.

493
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,320
Let's eat,

494
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,320
Boss.

495
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,840
So I'm here

496
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,680
to tell you that

497
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,920
I'm sorry

498
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,880
for what happened last time.

499
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,600
I've never seen

500
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,240
someone who apologizes

501
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,320
in such an arrogant way.

502
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,280
You can see it now.

503
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes.

504
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,400
How lovely!

505
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,400
So, this is the reason

506
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,360
you asked for

507
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,000
a hang out with me

508
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,600
and listen to your nonsense.

509
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,520
Jiang Xiao Ning is your friend, isn't she?

510
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,000
Do you know where she is now?

511
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,440
Did you follow me?

512
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
I tell you.

513
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,760
You can't touch me

514
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,840
and also my friend.

515
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,920
If you dare to seek attention

516
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,640
from Jiang Xiao Ning...

517
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,280
-No, I don't.
-Don't blame me if I...

518
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,720
Hold on, please.

519
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,680
You misunderstood me.

520
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,480
I've just realized that

521
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,240
I added her WeChat.

522
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
It's such a coincidence!

523
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,400
She's working at

524
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,800
the company where I invest.

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,120
You are her boss?

526
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
You are her boss?

527
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,240
Yes, I am.

528
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,800
This is obviously showing the differences

529
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,960
between a buyer's show and a seller's show.

530
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Xiao Ning described to me that

531
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,120
steady,

532
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,040
handsome,

533
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
and no much talking.

534
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,880
I think I should bring her

535
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,400
to check her brain

536
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,320
or maybe her eyes first.

537
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
What she described to you should be
another person.

538
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
An unimportant boss.

539
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,240
All these are not important.

540
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
The important point is that I've just

541
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,000
come across her posts in Moments.

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,520
And, you're here.

543
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,680
Are we

544
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,920
destined to meet each other?

545
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,960
I've done with my apologies.

546
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm leaving now.

547
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,480
I will take good care of

548
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,440
Jiang Xiao Ning in the company.

549
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,120
So?

550
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,280
So, can you have a date with me?

551
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Is it so difficult

552
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,720
to secure a job now?

553
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,440
I even have to make an appointment
for my best friend.

554
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
I just want to get to know more about you

555
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,080
to see if it's possible for both of us...

556
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,600
No.

557
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,360
You didn't even give me a chance to start
and you announced it's ended.

558
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,320
That's quite hurtful.

559
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,640
What do you like about me?

560
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
I think that your shoulder throw

561
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,200
is too amazing and charming.

562
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,800
I think so.

563
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,960
And also this smug face

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
is really attractive for me.

565
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Are you born with a silver spoon?

566
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,760
Kind of.

567
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
That's a pity.

568
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I

569
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,680
have no other talents.

570
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,080
But I know my own background

571
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,280
really well.

572
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm not suitable to marry into a rich family.

573
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,000
And I don't want to be placed

574
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,840
on a balance to be compared.

575
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,360
So...

576
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,520
In short,

577
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
I'm allergic to a silver spoon.

578
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,280
Oh, right.

579
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
Especially someone like you.

580
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,920
Bumming around all day.

581
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,920
A silver spoon who lives like a bird.

582
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
She got it all!

583
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,320
She can see through me at a glance.

584
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,520
She is adorable and charming

585
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,400
even when she refuses me.

586
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,520
I really like her!

587
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
(Modern women's perception on this society)

588
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
All these are not important now.

589
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Go ahead.

590
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
It might be Mr. Xu.

591
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,720
I go open the door.

592
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,920
Wait.

593
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Boss.

594
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,920
It seems that they are not at home.

595
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
You know the password, don't you?

596
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
Let's go in and see.

597
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,600
What happened?

598
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,720
Boss.

599
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Just now...

600
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
Are you okay?

601
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
What's wrong with you?

602
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
You startled me.

603
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,160
Did I enter the wrong house?

604
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,200
How could it be possible?

605
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,040
I saw a woman in the house.

606
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,880
And, both of them

607
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
hug each other.

608
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
You miss your son a lot.

609
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,160
You haven't seen him in a few years.

610
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,560
That's just a hallucination.

611
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,880
Are you dazzled?

612
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm not.

613
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
I saw it clearly.

614
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,040
If you can see clearly,

615
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,080
then open the door again

616
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,120
and go in to have a look.

617
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,720
And, you can see clearly.

618
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,800
Son,

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,680
Dad and I

620
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
are coming in now.

621
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,200
This is the focus of the design plan.

622
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,000
You must remember it.

623
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
Okay?

624
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
Son.

625
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,040
Dad. Mum.

626
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,920
When did you come in?

627
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,600
We just came in a while.

628
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
See, I told you that you have blurred vision.

629
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,040
You have the entry password?

630
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,400
I...

631
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,880
Your mum and I have been living

632
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,000
for several days in the hotel.

633
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,200
We made calls to you.

634
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
Why didn't you answer our calls?

635
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,320
We can't do anything.

636
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,680
We're here to see you.

637
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,320
We have no new idea.

638
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,520
So we made a call to Xu Cheng Ran.

639
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,560
And he told us the password.

640
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,000
Hi, uncle and aunty.

641
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,040
Hi.

642
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,520
Hi.

643
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
You are...

644
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,280
I...

645
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,840
She's my newly recruited assistant.

646
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,920
Did you jot down

647
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,080
the points that I told you?

648
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,040
Yes. I jotted it down.

649
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,120
I jotted down all the points.

650
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,160
The computer is not turned on yet.

651
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
And he is assigning tasks.

652
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,480
There is a lot of delicious food.

653
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Little girl.

654
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,200
Are all these made by you?

655
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,120
Yes, I made all these.

656
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,400
Uncle. Aunty.

657
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,320
Have you had your lunch yet?

658
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,160
Haven't yet.

659
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,040
We're here to visit Xiao Chuan

660
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
and have a meal together.

661
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,080
It's just in time.

662
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Let's eat together.

663
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,400
Okay.

664
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,280
Uncle, aunty, have a seat.

665
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,840
Have your seat, mum.

666
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,440
Uncle. Aunty.

667
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,240
This is your tableware.

668
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
Thank you.

669
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you.

670
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,760
You're welcome.

671
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,480
Little girl.

672
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,320
How old are you?

673
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,080
Twenty-three.

674
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,960
You're so young.

675
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
How long have you been with

676
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,080
Xiao Chuan?

677
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,200
-Mum.
-Aunty.

678
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,120
I'm just an assistant to Mr.Gu.

679
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,880
What's your name?

680
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

681
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
It's Cong (onion) from
the word onion, ginger, and garlic.

682
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
I mean Jiang (ginger).

683
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
It's Xiao (small) from
the word big and small.

684
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,960
It's Ning from the word serenity.

685
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,720
Jiang Xiao Ning.

686
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

687
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,480
Jiang Xiao Ning.

688
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,400
You've done with your job.

689
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,440
You can go to work now.

690
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,720
Yes.

691
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,040
I've done the jobs here.

692
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,920
Uncle. Aunty.

693
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm leaving now.

694
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,760
Don't.

695
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,520
There are many dishes here.

696
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,640
You should join us before you go.

697
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Enjoy the meal.

698
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,280
Enjoy the meal.

699
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,360
Just join us.

700
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
Xiao Chuan, you...

701
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,160
(Oh no!)

702
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,960
(I'm always unlucky.)

703
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,520
(Would it cause the boss to be misunderstood?)

704
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
(It happened just by the time...)

705
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,000
Boss.

706
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,480
(This doesn't seem to be very unlucky.)

707
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
(Jiang Xiao Ning.)

708
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,600
(What's wrong with you?)

709
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,840
(Stop thinking too much.)

710
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,040
(Back to work.)

711
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,160
Come on, have some fruit.

712
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,680
This little girl is great.

713
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,760
She can cook at a young age.

714
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,840
She cooks really well.

715
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Xiao Chuan.

716
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
Is this house cleaned by her?

717
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,400
How clean this is!

718
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,280
You have such a girlfriend

719
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,440
who takes care of you by your side.

720
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,280
Your father and I can rest assured.

721
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
Mum.

722
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,440
I tell you once again.

723
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,160
She's just my assistant,

724
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,280
not my girlfriend.

725
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,400
How long will you both

726
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
stay here this time?

727
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,600
Stay?

728
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,280
We've been here for days,

729
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
living in the hotel every day.

730
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,720
That's no reason for us to stay.

731
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,480
We're heading back tomorrow.

732
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,800
Gu.

733
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,120
Son.

734
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,600
Regarding the matter that I told you last time,

735
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
what do you think of it?

736
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,840
If you don't have any comments,

737
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
your father and I

738
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,520
will stay here for a few more days

739
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,000
and look up some houses around here.

740
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,320
What house to see?

741
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Why should you ask him about that?

742
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,560
Is he paying for that?

743
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,480
Why do you ask him

744
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,200
everything you want to do?

745
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,040
Can't you

746
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,120
speak nicely to him?

747
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,520
Didn't I speak nicely?

748
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
Over the past ten years,

749
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,600
we never dare to

750
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
speak badly to him.

751
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
We don't dare.

752
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,280
Every word that

753
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,520
we spoke to him was always

754
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,440
after careful consideration.

755
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,960
We were always afraid that our words
might stimulate him.

756
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,080
What about him?

757
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,680
Everything was still fine in the past few years.

758
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,640
But ever since he started his business,

759
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,640
our relationship with him

760
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,760
is getting more and more alienated.

761
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,760
I have no idea about it.

762
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
Did we do something

763
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,320
that offended him?

764
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Just stop.

765
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,000
I've been keeping the words

766
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,120
in my heart for a long time.

767
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
I must ask him about that

768
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,720
face to face today.

769
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Xiao Chuan.

770
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,840
I'd like to ask you a question.

771
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
You don't have to consider how I feel.

772
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,120
Why do you treat your mum

773
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,840
so indifferently?

774
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
Why?

775
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
I am used to being alone.

776
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
I don't like people disturbing me.

777
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,600
I am not used to it

778
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,600
when there are many people at home.

779
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,280
Say it again.

780
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,960
Xiao Chuan.

781
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
Do you know?

782
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,880
You are not hurting your heart,

783
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,199
but your mind.

784
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,880
How could I have

785
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,920
such a son like you?

786
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
How can you say

787
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,520
such words to us?

788
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Do you know?

789
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,080
In order to

790
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,560
collect enough surgical expenses,

791
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,719
we've spent

792
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,239
all our savings.

793
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,199
When you were lying

794
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,480
on the bed in the hospital,

795
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,720
your mum

796
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,480
stayed by your side

797
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,520
all day and night

798
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,640
without leaving you a step

799
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,880
until you recover.

800
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
If

801
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,480
your mum knew that

802
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
she saved such

803
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,640
a ruthless son like you,

804
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,480
she would rather not save you.

805
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,200
Yes.

806
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,680
You're right.

807
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,000
Everyone is having sympathy.

808
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,000
But I don't.

809
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,960
There are reasons

810
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,760
that make me become like this, isn't it?

811
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,840
Look at me now.

812
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,120
I can't

813
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,160
live with you now.

814
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,800
I can't get married or have children.

815
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,560
I can't give you

816
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
a chance to enjoy family happiness.

817
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,720
So,

818
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
can you assume that

819
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,280
you don't have a son?

820
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,240
Okay.

821
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,520
I agree.

822
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,000
Gu.

823
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,920
It's okay.

824
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,800
That's all right.

825
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,200
Just do it like this.

826
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,440
Jiang Xiao Ning.

827
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,080
Sister Man Lin.

828
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,760
Why didn't you

829
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,640
come to work this morning?

830
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,000
The boss asked me to take a leave.

831
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,400
He asked me not to get back to work
until he comes back.

832
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,120
Do you know his schedule?

833
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,080
He only told me that he was busy.

834
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I'm not sure what he's busy with.

835
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,800
Boss...

836
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,080
He...

837
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,240
(How could I have)

838
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,120
(such a son like you?)

839
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,880
(How can you say)

840
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,800
(those words to me?)

841
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,120
(You're not hurting your heart,)

842
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,280
(but your mind.)

843
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,160
(Can you assume that)

844
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,960
(you don't have a son?)

845
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,720
(Alright.)

846
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
(I agree.)

847
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,720
(Dad.)

848
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,880
(Mum.)

849
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
(I'm sorry.)

850
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier

851
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,000
that such things have happened?

852
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,480
I'm sorry, Sister Man Lin.

853
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
I thought that the boss would tell you.

854
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,760
Where is he now?

855
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,560
How is he now?

856
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,080
He looks quite good.

857
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,600
I went to his home and cooked for him.

858
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,520
He's eating with his dad and mum now.

859
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
You cooked?

860
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,400
Since he is injured,

861
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,880
I cooked a few simple dishes for him.

862
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,840
Send me his address now.

863
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,680
I'll pay a visit to him.

864
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,400
My dear Chuan, I'm back.

865
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,840
How obedient you are,

866
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,360
waiting for me in the living room.

867
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,680
See, I treat you really nice.

868
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,360
Even I go out,

869
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,200
I still bring you

870
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
some consolation gifts.

871
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,640
Why do you ignore me?

872
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,480
Don't be aggressive.

873
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,960
Let's have a talk slowly.

874
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,600
Do you want to stay away from me first?

875
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,880
Why did you tell my parents

876
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
the entry password of my home?

877
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,000
No.

878
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,160
I can't even tell your own parents?

879
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,520
Of course, you can't.

880
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,560
You can't tell anyone

881
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,520
without my permission.

882
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,360
I realized that you

883
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,040
intended to tell everyone

884
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,000
the entry password of my house.

885
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,360
No.

886
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,520
Fine.

887
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I won't tell it in the future, okay?

888
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,640
Since

889
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
I bought you so many things here,

890
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,000
stop being angry okay?

891
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
Why do you buy so many things?

892
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Do you want to ask me a favor?

893
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,920
What a joke.

894
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,080
I'm not someone like that.

895
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,680
I just think that I might be very busy

896
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,520
after this,

897
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
that I won't have much time to accompany you.

898
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,400
So...

899
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,880
Who are you going to harm this time?

900
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,240
I see I'm such a kind of person

901
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,000
in your eyes.

902
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,800
That's who you are.

903
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm telling you very seriously.

904
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm serious about that.

905
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,320
You have been saying it

906
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,240
six hundred and thirty times this year.

907
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,120
This time is different.

908
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,920
This time

909
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,600
is kind of

910
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
a destined fate.

911
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,000
It seems that

912
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,440
my previous experiences

913
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,080
are accumulated

914
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,720
just for this encounter.

915
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,440
And also, do you know that

916
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
she's actually Jiang Xiao Ning's best friend.

917
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
I got it now.

918
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,000
You are here to beg me

919
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,240
for asking Jiang Xiao Ning to help you.

920
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,560
Am I right?

921
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,520
Why do I have to beg you?

922
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,480
I, Xu Cheng Ran

923
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,160
doesn't need help from others.

924
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,880
You really don't need it, right?

925
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,320
Alright.

926
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,280
Then, you may go back.

927
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,560
I just came in here

928
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,520
and you wanted to chase me out.

929
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,080
Let me tell you about her.

930
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,080
I've never seen

931
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
a woman like her.

932
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,520
Is that so?

933
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,400
Yes.

934
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
Imagine that

935
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,160
if you are with Jiang Xiao Ning in the future,

936
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,200
and I'm with Yan Yan. Four of us...

937
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,680
Okay.

938
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,440
Stop it here.

939
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,080
I realize that

940
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,160
you are just like Jiang Xiao Ning.

941
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,160
Daydreaming always.

942
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,520
Go back to your home now.

943
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,960
Don't waste my time.

944
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
Let me stay a while longer.

945
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,280
There's a guest.

946
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,920
I'll open the door.

947
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,320
Man Lin.

948
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,960
Mr. Gu.

949
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
Jiang Xiao Ning

950
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,040
has told me everything.

951
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,120
Why didn't you tell me?

952
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,560
How's the injury?

953
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,760
How did you find me here?

954
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,640
He's not in a good mood today.

955
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,560
Thank you for visiting me.

956
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,840
But I don't want to see anyone today.

957
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,640
I just came to see if you're okay.

958
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm relieved knowing that you're okay.

959
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm leaving now.

960
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,880
If you are not feeling well,

961
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,080
you can rest for a few days more.

962
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,400
I need your help

963
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,920
with a matter tomorrow.

964
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,720
What do you want me to do?

965
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,520
My parents will go home tomorrow.

966
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:44,920
So...

967
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,040
Let Jiang Xiao Ning do it.

968
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
I will do it.

969
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,280
Don't worry.

970
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,080
Thank you.

971
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,680
Xu Cheng Ran.

972
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,760
