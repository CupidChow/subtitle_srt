21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,280
Sister Yan Yan.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,120
Is this okay?

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,120
Let me see.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Is this okay?

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,920
In your career,

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,360
you need to have a hint of sexiness.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,760
But at the same time, you need to look
innocent and cute.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
I think this is nice.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Really?

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,760
By the way,

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
this is a better match.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,880
Don't you think that

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,280
this is too expensive and formal?

34
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,440
I went there yesterday.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,440
All of them are wearing very casually.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
The first rule in a workplace,

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,880
never lose

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
on your first day at work.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
That makes sense.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,960
But I'd better

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
give this bag back to you.

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Take it back.

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,400
Sister Yan Yan, I'm going to be late.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
I have to leave now.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Look. My canvas bag

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
is quite nice too.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Jiang Xiao Ning!

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
What time is it now?

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,440
As an assistant,

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,120
how can you

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
be here later than the boss?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,040
Something happened on my way here.

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
These are gifts for everyone.

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,600
Well...

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Okay.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,880
Well...

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,280
It's okay.

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,160
Let me tell you.

60
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
The work culture in our company

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,200
is free, relaxed, and casual.

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
Look at what you are wearing.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Your clothes are too formal.

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
I was thinking that I can't lose

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
on my first working day.

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
So...

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,320
That's the spirit.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,480
Okay now.

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,560
Go and find Mr. Gu.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
Where is he?

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,120
I can still make it even if

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
go and pick up your parents first.

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,320
After all, they know me.

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
It's more comfortable for them.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,880
I never thought that

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
they would contact you straight away.

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Sorry for the trouble.

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Not at all.

79
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
They are no longer young.

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
They need someone familiar

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
to take care of them.

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Come in.

83
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you here?

84
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Hello, Miss Su.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I asked her to come.

86
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
From today on,

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,160
Jiang Xiao Ning

88
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,080
will be my driver plus assistant.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
But yesterday didn't you say that...

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Go back to your work.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Congratulations, Jiang Xiao Ning.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,080
From now on,

93
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
do your best.

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Thank you, Miss Su.

95
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
You can call me Sister Man Lin.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Okay, Sister Man Lin.

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
I'll get going first.

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Mr. Gu.

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,080
No. Boss.

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,480
Just call me Mr. Gu,

101
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,600
just like others.

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay, Mr. Gu.

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,240
Didn't you

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
turn me down yesterday?

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,280
Why did you...

106
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,080
If you are not willing to be here,

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
it's not too late to leave.

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm super willing to work here.

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
What do I need to do then?

110
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,640
You are my assistant nominally.

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
But stay out of

112
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,760
any of my personal matters.

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
You just need to drive me around.

114
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,400
For the rest of the time,

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
just stay in the company.

116
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
As for what you want to learn,

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,880
you can do that

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,240
as long as you don't affect

119
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,320
others' work.

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,440
Okay, Mr. Gu.

121
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,600
Come with me to organize some files first.

122
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,920
Then, we'll go to the resort for a meeting.

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
Okay.

124
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,180
(Office)

125
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Mr. Gu, here's a speed bump.

126
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Be careful.

127
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
Mr. Gu, where's your car?

128
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
That one.

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
Get in.

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Press it.

131
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,800
Mr. Gu, let's go.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,760
Okay.

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
Why is it so quiet?

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Mr. Gu, the car is broken.

135
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
This is an electric car.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
You just need to change the gear.

137
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,200
Okay, Mr. Gu.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,160
Drive carefully. Look forward.

139
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
It is red light now, Mr. Gu.

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm not trying to spy on you.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,040
I just want to learn.

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,200
I've never come into contact

143
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,640
with such a high-level project before.

144
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,680
How about this.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Join us for the meeting later.

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Really?

147
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Just keep quiet.

148
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Man Lin is here.

150
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Hello, uncle, auntie.

151
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
Hello.

152
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,040
Come, auntie.

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,720
Leave this to me.

154
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,400
Thank you. Sorry for troubling you every time.

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
You are very welcome.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Mr. Gu has a very important

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,040
meeting today.

158
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
He really can't make it.

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
So, he asked me to pick you up.

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Is that true?

161
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't need to care whether it's true or not.

162
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,160
No need to

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,080
take it seriously.

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
He didn't even answer your call.

165
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,240
Do you really think that

166
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,960
he'll come here to pick you up?

167
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
Uncle.

168
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,960
I'll really have to speak up for Mr. Gu.

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,960
He specially asked me to pick you up

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,640
and personally booked

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
the hotel for you.

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
See?

173
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,440
I know that my son

174
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,760
cares about us.

175
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,640
Soon, he'll have more time after

176
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,960
he signs the contract.

177
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Come, uncle, auntie.

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,360
Let's go.

179
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,400
Let's go.

180
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Hello, we are from Chuan Studios.

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
Please wait for a moment while I check.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Thank you.

183
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,800
Mr. Gu.

184
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,360
Do I need to do anything later?

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,800
Listen.

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes? I'm listening.

187
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,160
What?

188
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Didn't you ask me to listen?

189
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm asking you to listen

190
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,680
and don't talk.

191
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Okay.

192
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,480
Hello, Sir.

193
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
Please go to meeting room one.

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay. Thank you.

195
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Thank you.

196
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,980
(Become the leading brand
in the hotel design industry)

197
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Female driver?

198
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
Mr. Gu.

199
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,560
Is she from your company too?

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
I remember now.

201
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
We've met before.

202
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,320
How did you get in

203
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,120
during the day?

204
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,480
We don't need a designated driver here.

205
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Get out.

206
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,720
She is my assistant.

207
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,960
Today is her first day of work.

208
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
First day of work?

209
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,790
Is this a coincidence

210
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
or did you plan this?

211
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
First, you are a designated driver.

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
And suddenly, you are an employee.

213
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
You are indeed from a designing company.

214
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
What a great plan.

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Mr. He.

216
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,920
This is really not the case.

217
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,160
I can explain it to you.

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
Even if you are his assistant

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
and I believe that,

220
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,600
tell me why she said that

221
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
she is a designated driver

222
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
on that day.

223
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,520
Did you plan that on purpose to set me up?

224
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
Mr. Gu.

225
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,040
Is this how your company

226
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,080
shows your sincerity to collaborate with us?

227
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,520
I was a designated driver that day.

228
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
I just started working today.

229
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
You made a contribution on that night.

230
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,760
That's why you are working for him now.

231
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,720
They say that Chuan Studios is very professional.

232
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
Now, even a designated driver

233
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,800
can become

234
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
the personal assistant of

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,360
the chief architect.

236
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,200
This is so ridiculous.

237
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Looks like

238
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
we can't trust you with this project.

239
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Mr. Gu.

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,680
How about I wait for you in the car?

241
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,440
No.

242
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
You have to do the meeting minutes for me.

243
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,560
Even a designated driver

244
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,040
can do the meeting minutes now?

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
And you said that this is not a trick?

246
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
He Sheng.

247
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Qin.

248
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,040
Hello, Gu Chuan.

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Finally, we meet.

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
Hello, Mr. Qin.

251
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Come. Let's start the meeting.

252
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay. After you.

253
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
(Voice Memo)
Let's get started.

254
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,680
I look forward to your design.

255
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Me too.

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Mr. Qin.

257
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
I talked to Mr. Gu just now

258
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,920
and found out that Mr. Gu's assistant

259
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
was a designated driver.

260
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
It's her first day of work today.

261
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,280
So, I think that

262
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,840
such a comprehensive company like his

263
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,280
will definitely be able to present us

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
with extraordinary proposals.

265
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
You are right, Mr. He.

266
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,680
We are indeed

267
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
a comprehensive company.

268
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,680
Our studio welcomes anyone

269
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
with a will to chase after their dreams.

270
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,360
As long as they have a good personality,

271
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,000
we'll accept them.

272
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Mr. Qin.

273
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
I believe that

274
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,720
you've chosen our proposal

275
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,400
because you've already done

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,280
some research on our studio.

277
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
I believe that besides

278
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
our designs,

279
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
you are satisfied with

280
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,040
our working attitude as well.

281
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
Of course.

282
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
Business is business.

283
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I've indeed

284
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
seen your works before.

285
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
I've also asked around about
your company's reputation.

286
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,160
Your reputation is

287
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
as good as your designs.

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
I really admire your company.

289
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,560
So, when Mr. He presented me

290
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,440
with proposals from other companies,

291
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,760
I gave a priority

292
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
to your proposal first.

293
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,560
Thank you for your trust.

294
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Now, let me

295
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
explain to you

296
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
the overall idea

297
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,720
of our proposal.

298
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
Our design is based on

299
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,320
container hotels

300
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
that are rare in China.

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,440
When we talk about containers,

302
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,040
what will come to your mind first?

303
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
Colour, shape,

304
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,560
or its uses.

305
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
We'll put the containers one by one

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
on the mountain.

307
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
With the condition of total privacy,

308
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,880
the guests can enjoy

309
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,120
a 360-degree view

310
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
of different sceneries.

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,520
This is a mountain

312
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
that is away from the city.

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
If this hotel can become

314
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,680
a landmark at that place,

315
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sure you know

316
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,560
how beneficial it will be.

317
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,240
Let's take a look

318
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,480
at the design.

319
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,340
♪If the youth is precious, then cheers♪

320
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,260
♪Those passionate dreams follow my command♪

321
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,880
(I get to attend such an important meeting)

322
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
(with Mr. Gu on my first day of work)

323
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,360
(and get the chance to see such an amazing design.)

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,640
(Jiang Xiao Ning,)

325
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
(you finally have a change of luck.)

326
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,860
(Exit)

327
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
I chose the right boss.

328
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
You were awesome just now, Mr. Gu.

329
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,000
I was stunned.

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
Did you do the meeting minutes?

331
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,560
Yes.

332
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,280
Mr. Gu.

333
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,480
There are things that I don't understand.

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
Can you explain them to me?

335
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,520
I want to sort it out.

336
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,240
I don't have time

337
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
to explain them to you.

338
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,480
By the way,

339
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,600
when did you have a beef with He Sheng?

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,640
When you went drinking last time,

341
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,560
Sister Man Lin was drunk and she went to the toilet.

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Then...

343
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
Get to the point.

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
The point is,

345
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,640
Mr. He tried to take advantage of Sister Man Lin.

346
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,520
But I managed

347
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
to stop him.

348
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
He won't take revenge on us

349
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,760
because of this

350
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,280
and kick us out from this competition, right?

351
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
You are overthinking this.

352
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,080
Mr. Gu.

353
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,080
You talked so much

354
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,520
in the meeting just now.

355
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,360
You must be thirsty.

356
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
How about a bottle of water?

357
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,640
Whatever.

358
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,400
Wait for me.

359
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,520
Hurry up.

360
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
Mr. Gu is busy.

361
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Don't waste his time.

362
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,520
Hurry up.

363
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
You are still here.

364
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Mr. He.

365
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,160
Why are you so nervous?

366
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm not.

367
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Please give me back my phone.

368
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,480
Thank you.

369
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Who are you actually?

370
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,000
You have always been their employee,

371
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,800
right?

372
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
You did it on purpose

373
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,840
to trick me, right?

374
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
No. That's not true.

375
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
I am a newbie.

376
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't know what I did

377
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,000
to offend you.

378
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,840
You better be truthful with me.

379
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,360
I have a say in

380
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,280
the approval of your proposal.

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,440
Mr. He.

382
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,160
Our company's proposal

383
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,000
is really good.

384
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,680
So what if it's good?

385
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,200
I can totally turn it into

386
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,600
something bad.

387
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,760
How can you do that?

388
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,720
This is not about me.

389
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
This is about you.

390
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
This project is a huge gold mine.

391
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,480
We are all enjoying

392
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,600
the same profit.

393
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,360
You are full now.

394
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,640
But I'm still hungry.

395
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
I don't understand what you are talking about.

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,080
If I personally offended you,

397
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,000
I apologize.

398
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,800
Don't let it affect this project.

399
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,480
Mr. He.

400
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Don't be mad. Drink some water.

401
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,040
Do you want to eat anything? My treat.

402
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Two nights ago,

403
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
you ruined my plan.

404
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,040
Since you want to be responsible for it,

405
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
sure.

406
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,960
I don't care if you are a designated driver

407
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,360
or Gu Chuan's assistant.

408
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,280
If you make me happy,

409
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,080
I'll help you.

410
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,400
Mr. He.

411
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,360
How can I make you happy?

412
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,440
You are so innocent?

413
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
I really don't know

414
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
what you are talking about.

415
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,840
Mr. Gu is waiting for me in the car.

416
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,680
I have to leave now.

417
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,200
Are you looking down on me?

418
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
You!

419
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
Mr. He!

420
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
What are you trying to do?

421
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,440
Mr. Gu, it's good that you are here.

422
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,640
You saw it, right?

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,480
Your assistant sprayed water on me.

424
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,240
You should ask her instead.

425
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,880
That's not true.

426
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,800
Mr. He wanted to...

427
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
What did I want?

428
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,920
Are you going to say that I wanted to rape you?

429
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Just now, you said that...

430
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,240
What did I say?

431
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Do you think

432
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
I'll fancy you, an assistant?

433
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
No need to say anything.

434
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Jiang Xiao Ning,

435
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
call the police.

436
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
There's a CCTV here.

437
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
No matter whose fault it is,

438
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,120
we'll find out

439
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
after we check the CCTV.

440
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
He took away my phone.

441
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,840
Calm down.

442
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,600
Mr. Gu.

443
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Don't do this.

444
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm just talking about the designated driver

445
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,560
and design matter with your assistant.

446
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,360
If you want to talk about the design, come to me.

447
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,760
No need to find my female employee.

448
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Okay.

449
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,120
I understand.

450
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,680
Apologize.

451
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

452
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,240
Not to me.

453
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,640
Apologize to my assistant.

454
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm sorry, Assistant Jiang.

455
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,640
Forget it, Mr. Gu.

456
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,520
It's not a big deal.

457
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,040
Forget it.

458
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,760
What kind of attitude is this?

459
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
No.

460
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,200
Mr. Gu.

461
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
Don't make this into a big deal. Forget it.

462
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,120
Calm down.

463
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Fine.

464
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,400
If this happens again,

465
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
I'll see you at the police station.

466
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,480
Is there a CCTV here?

467
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,120
Great.

468
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,200
Gu Chuan!

469
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Give me the car key.

470
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I'll drive.

471
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,560
Boss.

472
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,560
Drive slowly.

473
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
Don't exceed the speed limit.

474
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,360
I always thought that

475
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
you hired me as a driver

476
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,360
because you can't drive.

477
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,760
I just don't drive often.

478
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,840
Why didn't you

479
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,560
shout for help just now?

480
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
I was in shock just now.

481
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,560
When you see him after this, shout for help.

482
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
Call me immediately.

483
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay.

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,840
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

485
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Boss, don't be mad.

486
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,640
I'll remember what you said.

487
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,480
If I meet someone like him again,

488
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,840
I'll call you immediately

489
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,080
and shout for help.

490
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
Boss.

491
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
What is it?

492
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,440
I have something to tell you.

493
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,360
It took me

494
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
a long time to finally

495
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
find my dream job.

496
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,920
And I even have

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
a great boss like you.

498
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,440
When I was listening

499
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,440
to your proposal today,

500
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
I was so excited.

501
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,880
You looked so shiny.

502
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,280
And I thought that

503
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,120
meeting you

504
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
is the beginning of my good luck.

505
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
If I work in this kind of company,

506
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
I'll get closer and closer

507
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,680
to my goal.

508
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,280
This is where

509
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
my dream begins.

510
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,320
But what if our proposal is rejected

511
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
because of He Sheng?

512
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,600
All of you

513
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,160
had put so much effort into it.

514
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,960
I don't want it to be ruined because of me.

515
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,600
Are you saying that

516
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,640
you are worried about

517
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,120
destroying the company all by yourself?

518
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,360
You are really overthinking this.

519
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
I kept thinking about it on my way back.

520
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,760
This is my first day of work

521
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,840
and I had brought so much trouble to you.

522
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm afraid that you'll fire me.

523
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
It's not easy for me

524
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,440
to find a job that I like.

525
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,800
Actually,

526
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm very unlucky since I was a child.

527
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,640
A lot of things are not my fault.

528
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,720
But everyone blames me for it.

529
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,160
And I got used to it.

530
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,080
But...

531
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,280
Are you done?

532
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,280
Yes.

533
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,520
When I'm agitated,

534
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,440
I'll start to blabber.

535
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,520
If you are done,

536
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
go back and rest now.

537
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,720
Mr. Gu.

538
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,600
Wait.

539
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
Wait for a moment.

540
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,320
Just a moment.

541
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
Mr. Gu, this is for you.

542
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,120
What is this?

543
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,000
A present.

544
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't open it until you are home.

545
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,600
Mr. Gu.

546
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,360
May you be healthy and happy.

547
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,680
Bye, Mr. Gu.

548
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,360
Mr. Gu, you are my idol.

549
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
Are you done?

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,320
Yes.

551
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,960
Are you really done?

552
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Yes.

553
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,280
Bye, Mr. Gu.

554
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
Bye, Mr. Gu.

555
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Mr. Gu, you are the coolest!

556
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
You are my idol Boss!

557

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,120

Apologize to my female assistant.

(Zhao Yan replied:)
(What's going on, lovesick?)

583
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,000
That was rude.

584
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,160
Run so fast. Afraid that I would catch up with you?

585
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,360
What's wrong, hottie?

586
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
A dozen beer is ready.

587
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
What's the rush, hottie?

588
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,840
Go to my place.

589
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,920
Kill the Satyr.

590
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,960
There will be drinks and alcohol.

591
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,160
And me.

592
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,740
(Block One)

593
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,560
Mr. Gu, good morning.

594
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,040
Good morning.

595
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,680
Sister Man Lin said you prefer light food.

596
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
So I made

597
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
oatmeal for you.

598
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,240
My cooking skills are just average.

599
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,040
But you must have some.

600
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,320
This breakfast is made for my idol.

601
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,720
If you don't eat it, it will hurt your fan's feelings.

602
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
Don't call me idol anymore.

603
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Or you'll be fired.

604
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,280
I'll remember this.

605
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,880
But you must have breakfast.

606
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,160
Skipping breakfast is bad for your health.

607
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,720
Okay, let's go.

608
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
You had your breakfast?

609
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
You asked Jiang Xiao Ning to make it?

610
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,120
Anyway,

611
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,880
do you know that

612
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,600
Nika is having a design exhibition here?

613
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,560
I don't know if you like him or not.

614
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,080
I kind of like him.

615
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,360
When I was abroad,

616
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,080
Xu Cheng Ran and I

617
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
went to see his exhibition before.

618
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,480
He'll be there today.

619
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,600
Mr. Xu gave me two tickets.

620
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Do you want to go with me?

621
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,480
Okay.

622
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,120
Bring along Jiang Xiao Ning.

623
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
She wants to learn.

624
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
But,

625
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,040
we've only got two tickets.

626
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,640
No worries.

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,640
I'll ask Xu Cheng Ran

628
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
for another ticket. It won't be troublesome.

629
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,720
Okay, I'll see you after work.

630
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Okay.

631
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,280
(Ouyang Zhen.)
(Regarding the order,)

632
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,920
(Ouyang Zhen.)
(would you like to have another talk about it?)

633
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,240
(Ouyang Zhen.)
(You can come to my place.)

634
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Rubbish.

635
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
(Xun Lu Group)

636
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,800
Manager Wei.

637
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,760
Zhao Yan.

638
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,560
I've spoken with

639
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,680
Mr. Ouyang over the phone.

640
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,680
Regarding the order matters,

641
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
we can work together.

642
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,800
You can set a time and make an appointment,

643
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,120
talk about the details.

644
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
Get it done as soon as possible, okay?

645
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,880
Okay.

646
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
Oh, right.

647
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,960
This evening, after work,

648
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,520
there will be a gathering.

649
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Let's have dinner and some drinks.

650
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
We'll sing some songs, etc.

651
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,160
You should join us.

652
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm tired from working overtime these two days.

653
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,280
So,

654
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,640
perhaps next time?

655
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
Everyone is tired.

656
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,480
That's why we need to relax.

657
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
Look at you.

658
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
You don't have to shut people out.

659
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,560
It's really inappropriate.

660
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Oh, this!

661
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,600
I need to send it over to the customer.

662
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,240
So,

663
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,960
I have to finish it by today.

664
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,120
I can't go.

665
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,320
Zhao Yan, please.

666
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,360
Yes.

667
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Zhao Yan, just go.

668
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,600
How about this?

669
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,640
You guys go ahead today.

670
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
Next round on me?

671
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,960
It's for our department.

672
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,080
I'm making money.

673
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay.

674
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,560
Get your job done.

675
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Don't work too hard.

676
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
Good for you.

677
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
Come, let's go.

678
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
Rubbish.

679
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,520
All are rubbish.

680
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
Is this really for me?

681
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,040
It's for you.

682
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Don't you like to learn?

683
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,920
This is a good opportunity.

684
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,120
I've never been to an exhibition.

685
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
I've only seen it on the internet.

686
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,360
Never seen this before.

687
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,440
I'm so happy.

688
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,480
Thank you.

689
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,320
That was easy for you to find happiness.

690
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,040
We've got great employee welfare in this company.

691
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,960
You're a fairy down from heaven,
overcoming poverty.

692
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
And I ran head-on into you.

693
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll see you after work then.

694
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,800
Mr. Gu will be joining us too.

695
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay.

696
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,640
Sister Man Lin, I need to answer the call.

697
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,800
Okay.

698
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,880
Hello.

699
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,240
Are you Jiang Xiao Ning?

700
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Please come to the hospital.

701
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,640
Someone in your family is hospitalized.

702
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Why are you stunned?

703
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Get ready with the drinks.

704
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,960
The customer will arrive soon.

705
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,200
Sister Man Lin.

706
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,800
I'd like to take leave later.

707
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,480
I'm okay with an unpaid leave today.

708
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,320
What's the matter? Something urgent happened?

709
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Something happened at home.

710
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,920
It's okay, you can go.

711
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,320
I'll inform Qi Hong.

712
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,280
Your work attendance is fine.

713
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,240
Thank you.

714
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Hurry, go.

715
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,500
(Consultation)

716
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,200
Excuse me.

717
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Where is the emergency room?

718
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,040
Over there.

719
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,960
Thank you.

720
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,140
(Emergency room)

721
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,420
(Ouyang Zhen)

722
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,740
(Call rejected)

723
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,720
Mr. Tang.

724
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,960
Don't need to be so formal.

725
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,200
Working overtime?

726
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
I just get some files sorted.

727
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,920
You seem busy recently.

728
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,600
At work,

729
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,880
is there any difficulty?

730
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,400
No.

731
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Doing good.

732
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,040
You're Xiao Ning's best friend.

733
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,640
If there is anything,

734
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,120
you can always tell me immediately.

735
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,080
Thank you.

736
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm doing okay.

737
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,840
Okay.

738
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,200
Your phone is ringing.

739
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,660
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

740
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,200
Xiao Ning.

741
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,400
Sister Yan Yan, aunt had an accident.

742
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
She is still in hospital for resuscitation.

743
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,800
Take it easy.

744
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,000
What happened to aunt?

745
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
She is still in hospital for resuscitation.

746
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
Still don't know how it is going to be.

747
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,040
Calm down.

748
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,200
Tell me which hospital.

749
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,320
I come over right now.

750
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,320
Don't come.

751
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
I called you

752
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,320
because I need you to help me
to take care of my grandma.

753
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,400
She's been having increased confusion recently.

754
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm worried that she is alone at home.

755
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,320
But...

756
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,680
Can you be there alone?

757
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm fine.

758
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Don't worry.

759
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,800
Aunt will be fine.

760
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,480
Let me take care of grandma.

761
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,480
I'll take care of her.

762
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,080
If anything happens,

763
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,240
call me immediately.

764
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Okay, thank you, sister Yan Yan.

765
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
What happened?

766
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,680
Aunt is in hospital.

767
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm going to take care of grandma now.

768
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,600
How about this?

769
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll take you to grandma's place first.

770
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,040
Then I'll go to the hospital to be with Xiao Ning.

771
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,560
Mr. Gu, let's go.

772
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,320
You don't want to run into a traffic jam.

773
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,440
Where is Jiang Xiao Ning?

774
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
I don't know.

775
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
After giving her the ticket.

776
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
I haven't seen her.

777
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,800
Did you arrange anything for her?

778
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,520
No.

779
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,160
Maybe she doesn't want to go.

780
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
But feel bad to tell you.

781
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
Or she went home to change clothes.

782
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,480
We shall just go first.

783
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,000
Call her.

784
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Doctor.

785
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,440
How is my aunt?

786
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,640
She is okay now.

787
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
Due to the hit to the head,

788
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,880
she is in a short coma now.

789
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,040
But I don't rule out

790
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,400
the possibility of having a concussion.

791
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,760
Let's wait for

792
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,720
the MRI result

793
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,760
to find out what actually it is.

794
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,920
How did she get hurt?

795
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
I'm not quite sure about it.

796
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,320
A passerby called 120.

797
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Emergency call.

798
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
Thank you, doctor.

799
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
It's okay.

800
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,580
(Su Man Lin)

801
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,600
Hello, sister Man Lin.

802
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,000
Where are you?

803
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,360
Mr. Gu.

804
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,280
I'm still outside.

805
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Today, maybe I...

806
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Not going to the exhibition?

807
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

808
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,200
I...

809
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,840
What's more important than
attending the exhibition?

810
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,200
Nothing.

811
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,880
My personal matters.

812
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,920
What about the dreams

813
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,400
and goals you always talked about?

814
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,960
Mr. Gu.

815
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,360
You're right.

816
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
I'm sorry.

817
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,000
I may have disappointed you.

818
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,280
I hope you can understand.

819
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,200
Jiang Mai's family member.

820
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,440
Come, please sign here.

821
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,520
Okay.

822
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,920
The medical expenses have to be

823
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,240
paid by today.

824
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,280
Okay, I get it.

825
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,680
Thank you.

826
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,040
Jiang Xiao Ning.

827
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Where are you?

828
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,940
(Nurse Station)

829
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

830
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,840
Mr. Gu, sister Man Lin.

831
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
What happened?

832
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
My aunt had a minor car accident.

833
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,080
Fortunately, a passerby took her
to the hospital in time.

834
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,920
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

835
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,760
I just feel that

836
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm a bit unlucky.

837
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,880
I missed such a great opportunity.

838
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,720
Please don't take it to your heart.

839
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Is she okay?

840
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,600
Yes.

841
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
The doctor said that she only needs to
be in hospital for a few days.

842
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,880
Su Man Lin.

843
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
Go and get the bill paid.

844
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
I'll ask the finance department to
transfer it to you.

845
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,800
Okay.

846
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
There's no need for it, Mr. Gu.

847
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,600
I just joined the company.

848
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm already so touched that

849
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,920
you came to the hospital.

850
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,960
If I asked you to help me

851
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,400
pay the medical expenses,

852
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,630
I don't think I can sleep well at night.

853
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,320
This is a loan from the company.

854
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
When your aunt gets better,

855
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,080
you still have to go back to the studio.

856
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,960
And you'll need to work harder too.

857
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,920
A portion of your monthly salary

858
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,360
will be deducted.

859
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,920
This is not a special treatment

860
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,190
given to you by the company.

861
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,040
There is no need to trouble you with the money.

862
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,670
Xiao Ning.

863
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,710
I've sent Zhao Yan over

864
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,670
to take care of your grandma.

865
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,630
How is aunt?

866
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,760
Nothing serious.

867
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
That's good.

868
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,760
Mr. Gu.

869
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,080
This is my good friend.

870
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,960
Tang Xu.

871
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,680
Brother Xu.

872
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,280
This is my boss, Mr. Gu.

873
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,800
Thank you for taking care of Xiao Ning.

874
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,560
Leave the rest

875
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,480
to me.

876
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,720
Xiao Ning, let's go and pay the fee.

877
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,680
Don't worry, Xiao Ning.

878
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
I just don't want you to

879
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
have too much pressure.

880
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,160
Wait till you earn a lot of money in the future.

881
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,040
Only then you can pay me back.

882
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,720
Brother Xu.

883
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,800
Using your money

884
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,920
will be a pressure for me.

885
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,760
I've already thought about it.

886
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,000
Mr. Gu.

887
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,280
Do I have to pay the interest?

888
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,280
No need.

889
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,000
With such an amount of money,

890
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,440
do you have to act like a savior?

891
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,520
Brother Xu, I don't think that's the case.

892
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,120
Mr. Gu is a kind person.

893
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,560
It's a bit hard for me

894
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
to raise enough money in a short time.

895
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,800
Can I borrow it from the company first?

896
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Of course, you can.

897
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,040
Didn't I just say so?

898
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,760
But

899
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,560
in the future,

900
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,000
if you want to leave the company,

901
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,600
you must make up the amount.

902
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,880
You may leave the company after doing so.

903
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,280
That means,

904
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,840
Mr. Gu also can't

905
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,000
fire me simply.

906
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,600
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

907
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll give you an IOU.

908
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Xiao Ning.

909
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,200
You don't have to.

910
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,680
It feels like he is giving alms.

911
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Regarding Jiang Xiao Ning's matter,

912
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I've taken care of everything.

913
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,720
I'll hand over the IOU to the Financial Department tomorrow.

914
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,000
Although there is no such precedent before,

915
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,840
it won't be troublesome

916
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,360
to sort it out too.

917
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,280
Okay.

918
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,440
Jiang Xiao Ning is quite strange too.

919
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,800
That friend of hers

920
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,440
seems quite into her.

921
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,920
People are giving her for free,
but she didn't want it.

922
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
She rather borrows from the company.

923
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,120
Do you really want to deduct it from her salary?

924
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,280
Else?

925
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,080
Deduct it from your salary?

926
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,000
I didn't mean that.

927
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,280
All I'm saying is

928
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,880
I feel that the way you treated Jiang Xiao Ning

929
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,480
is a bit different.

930
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,040
Did I?

931
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,280
No employee has

932
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
such precedent before.

933
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,920
I just hope that

934
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,480
nothing like this will happen

935
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,160
to other's families.

936
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,800
And everyone can always

937
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
stay healthy and happy.

938
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,200
You're right.

939
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm surprised.

940
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,240
Before this, you never said

941
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,280
something like this.

942
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Even if you did it, you wouldn't say it.

943
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,240
It wasn't me to say so.

944
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,960
Jiang Xiao Ning said it.

945
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,400
When you mention her,

946
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,000
you seem to talk a lot.

947
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,240
Attending the exhibition too.

948
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,560
You bring her along.

949
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,060
(Dr.P)

950
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
Xiao Chuan.

951
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm in front of your house.

952
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,320
I have something new as a gift today,

953
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,680
I wanted to give it to you.

954
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm going home now.

955
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,920
Although you look like you're shocked,

956
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
the value is normal.

957
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,880
It means

958
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,520
you're used to getting shocked.

959
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
Every time you're here, you behave like this.

960
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,160
I'm so used to it.

961
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm so used to you to the extend

962
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,760
I don't even have reflex action
towards you anymore.

963
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,840
Anyway.

964
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,320
My small step

965
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,720
is your big step.

966
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Open the door.

967
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,360
Aunt.

968
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,760
You finally woke up.

969
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
Xiao Ning.

970
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,280
I got into trouble again.

971
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,160
It's okay.

972
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,320
You finally get to

973
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
earn some money.

974
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,120
Now you have spent it all on me.

975
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,960
Does it matter?

976
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,280
Do we have to talk about this now?

977
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,880
What actually matters is you're okay.

978
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,280
You scared me to death.

979
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,480
I'm so afraid that something will happen to you.

980
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,400
Don't move around.

981
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,640
I wasn't careful enough.

982
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
I thought the weather was good.

983
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,920
I was going to get the medicine for your grandma.

984
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,600
Then,

985
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,840
I rode on your scooter

986
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,240
and went out.

987
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,960
Unexpectedly, my waist

988
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,400
couldn't move in a sudden.

989
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,240
I then hit the tree.

990
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,880
You should go back and check on your scooter.

991
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,320
See whether it can be repaired.

992
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,280
What if it is broken?

993
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,720
Xiao Ning.

994
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,880
Am I crippled?

995
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,680
No, no.

996
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,400
Is my face disfigured?

997
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
I couldn't get married anymore?

998
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,400
Your face is not disfigured.

999
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,880
You can still get married.

1000
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
You're already in such a condition.

1001
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,720
Please don't say things that made me feel bad.

1002
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,840
You just have a good rest.

1003
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,720
And recuperate from it.

1004
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Don't think about anything.

1005
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:32,880
There is nothing more important than

1006
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,800
you and grandma.

1007
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,000
Get it?

1008
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,400
How are you feeling now?

1009
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,720
Pain.

1010
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,880
Okay, okay.

1011
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,720
Don't think of anything.

1012
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,240
I'll be here if there is anything.

1013
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
What is the update?

1014
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,080
You'll know in a while.

1015
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,760
When

1016
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
I'll be normal?

1017
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,320
Am I not working hard enough now?

1018
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,800
You need to have faith in me...

1019
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,720
What did you say just now?

1020
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,760
What?

1021
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,080
Normally, you'll ask me

1022
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,000
when will you die?

1023
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
But just now you asked me...

1024
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,120
You asked when

1025
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,680
you will be a normal person.

1026
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,520
Did I?

1027
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,320
I was just asking.

1028
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,440
You asked casually

1029
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,000
and that's your inner voice.

1030
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,280
It comes out spontaneously.

1031
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,200
Maybe.

1032
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,320
Look.

1033
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
You even admit it yourself.

1034
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,600
Xiao Chuan.

1035
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,240
Is it my effort

1036
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,760
that touched you?

1037
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,160
Doctor.

1038
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,680
You're overthinking it.

1039
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,000
Tell me.

1040
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,160
Have you recently

1041
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,200
met anyone?

1042
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,840
Met someone?

1043
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,640
I met someone.

1044
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,920
Just an employee.

1045
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
Did this

1046
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,600
new employee

1047
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,600
change you?

1048
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,480
A female employee.

1049
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,160
Yes, female.

1050
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,640
Do you have feelings for her?

1051
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,240
She changes you.

1052
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,920
Doctor.

1053
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
I think you're out of the topic.

1054
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,160
I sometimes wonder.

1055
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Why did I put my life

1056
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,200
in your hands?

1057
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,120
Also,

1058
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,160
did you buy

1059
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,200
your Doctoral Diploma?

1060
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,840
You!

1061
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,000
Please don't doubt

1062
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,480
my professionalism.

1063
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,600
In this field,

1064
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,120
I have authority too.

1065
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,240
Those who produce the heart

1066
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,160
may have done it steadily,

1067
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,280
but not as great as me.

1068
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,160
Those did well,

1069
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
didn't do it as steadily as I did.

1070
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
Look at it.

1071
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,280
Look at this new design.

1072
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,960
I specially made it for you.

1073
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,640
It's a heart rate simulation icon.

1074
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,080
What do you think?

1075
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,160
Isn't it beautiful?

1076
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,400
You came all the way,

1077
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,920
just to add this to me?

1078
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,360
No, not only this.

1079
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,200
It's an upgraded version.

1080
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,840
This allows your heart

1081
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,920
to charge faster.

1082
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,560
I also brought a charging generator.

1083
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,120
When you're on a business trip,

1084
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
it helps

1085
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,800
solve your temporarily charging issues.

1086
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,200
Aren't I attentive?

1087
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,520
Yes.

1088
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,480
Work hard.

1089
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,880
Work hard.

1090
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,720
You can do it.
