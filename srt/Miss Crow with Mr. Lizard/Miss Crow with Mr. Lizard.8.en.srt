Mr. Gu, this is for you.

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
What is this?

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,840
A present.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Mr. Gu, I wish you good health and happiness.

Aunt.

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,360
Aunt, please hear me out first.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Jiang Xiao Ning.

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,040
Have you forgotten?

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
You foolish girl.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Your father never took a single cent

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
from anyone.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,240
Why could he embezzle

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
tens of millions of public funds?

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,120
That is all because of this

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,880
so-called good friend!

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,000
Your father.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
My brother.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
Would I not know what kind of

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,880
person he is?

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Dead men tell no tales.

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,000
No.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,600
How could he

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
be framed by such a person?

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Do you understand?

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
It's already in the past.

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Besides, Brother Xu has nothing to do with this.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm telling you I won't forget this.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
I will never

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,600
move on from this.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,040
We'll leave.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
We are moving out right now.

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,440
Mom.

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,400
Let's go.

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
Please calm down.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
You've only just recovered.

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,320
Grandma is getting on in years.

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
She couldn't stand being in distress.

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll head back first.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll visit you another day.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,720
You don't have to go.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,040
It's us who should move out.

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,080
Jiang Xiao Ning.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you leaving?

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Aunt, aunt.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,080
Mom.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,680
Aunt!

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,840
Aunt.

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
When you were admitted to the hospital,

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,520
grandma forgot to turn off the stove

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
and almost burned the entire house down.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
I don't have any money left

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,120
to compensate the landlord.

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
You should know that

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
the money used to pay your hospital bills

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,040
was borrowed from my company.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,120
I can't afford

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
any agent fees or deposits anymore.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Xiao Ning,

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
you have to understand.

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,920
You know it too.

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,360
I can't talk about your father.

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
Whenever I do, I just get so angry.

84
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,680
I just couldn't help it.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm not blaming you.

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't cry.

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,600
You poor thing.

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
All right.

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,839
I promise that

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,480
I will work hard

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
and make a lot of money.

92
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
When the house is fixed,

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,560
we will go back to our place.

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay?

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Get some rest with grandma.

96
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
I'll go and talk to Brother Xu.

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
Don't ever mention his name.

98
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,560
Xiao Ning.

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you okay?

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm fine, Brother Xu.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,800
Brother Xu, please understand my aunt.

102
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
That's the way she is.

103
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
She's just harsh with her words.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
She probably

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,880
still couldn't let go of the past.

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,800
I understand.

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
But we don't know

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,840
the truth behind it.

109
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
No matter what happened,

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,880
we still grew up together.

111
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
What happened between the last generation

112
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
stays with them.

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,600
It won't change us,

114
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,280
no matter the circumstances.

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
What about you?

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840
Will you blame me

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,280
just like your aunt does?

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,840
I won't.

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,160
You're still Brother Tang Xu

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,080
that I know since little.

121
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
Besides, it doesn't hurt me

122
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,120
as much now.

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,960
It's as you said.

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,480
Being alive

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,000
is about moving forward.

126
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,760
I still have a lot of important things

127
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,280
to do.

128
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,280
I believe

129
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,160
my parents are watching me

130
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,840
from heaven.

131
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
If I'm sad,

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
they will be upset too.

133
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,480
I know

134
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
you're not involved.

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,880
But...

136
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,520
I understand.

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,080
Xiao Ning.

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
For you,

139
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
I will try my best to let her

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
change her mind about me.

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,440
I'm sorry, Brother Xu.

142
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,480
I never thought things

143
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
would end up like this.

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,560
When our house is fixed,

145
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,320
we'll move back immediately.

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,960
Thank you, Brother Xu.

147
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,680
I feel much refreshed after a bath.

148
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,240
Did I have a bad fall

149
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,920
just now?

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,240
Did you lose your memory?

151
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
Who am I?

152
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,320
Where am I?

153
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,640
But why is my phone

154
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,280
not ringing at all?

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
Why didn't Yan Yan look for me?

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,760
Why are you still working at this hour?

157
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Don't push yourself so hard to earn money for me.

158
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm very glad

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,400
but I care for you more.

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,720
What are you so invested in?

161
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,320
Doing my notes.

162
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Whose notebook is this?

163
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
Mine.

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,560
Your notebook?

165
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,440
Such a girly notebook?

166
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,020
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

167
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,400
Jiang Xiao Ning?

168
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
You are annotating Jiang Xiao Ning's design?

169
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
You care for her this much?

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,560
She has huge potential.

171
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
She deserves some guidance.

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,320
I think you're getting old that

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,120
you are starting to like to preach.

174
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Then do I have the potential?

175
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,920
You?

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Forget about it.

177
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,840
No matter how you insult me,

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
even if you throw me

179
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,440
the nastiest remarks,

180
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,160
you can't extinguish

181
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,000
the burning curiosity in my heart.

182
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,000
Tell me.

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Did you fall for Jiang Xiao Ning?

184
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,960
Yes.

185
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,920
She's ambitious and motivated.

186
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,680
Plus, she's optimistic and full of life.

187
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,280
If there is proper guidance,

188
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,640
she can be

189
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,120
a great architect in the future.

190
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
What I feel for her

191
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,920
is how an employer

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,680
likes his employee.

193
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,720
That's all.

194
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,360
That's all?

195
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
If that's the case,

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,600
you can't be the one

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
to return this notebook to her.

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
Why?

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
As her boss,

200
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,480
you annotated her design.

201
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,160
That's already a big favor.

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
To not let her misunderstand,

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,400
I will be the one

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
to return this notebook to her.

205
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,360
That's decided.

206
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
Chuan.

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Thank you.

208
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,799
What for?

209
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,240
For giving me

210
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,600
a proper reason

211
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,400
to go to Yan Yan.

212
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
This will be my ultimate weapon

213
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
when she doesn't want to see me.

214
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
That would have to wait until
she's willing to see you.

215
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,160
Whether she wants to or not,

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
I'm going to see her.

217
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,220
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

218
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
Can you put on some clothes?

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
Do you not realize

220
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,640
you wear the same clothes every day?

221
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
It's either white, gray, or black.

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
I have zero desire

223
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,600
to wear your clothes.

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
Sure, then don't wear any.

225
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,040
Lend me some clothes.

226
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Here is the

227
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,880
detailed business plan.

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,880
Mr. Xu, what do you think?

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
It's good.

230
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Very good.

231
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
This operation plan

232
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,760
is done very well.

233
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,040
Thank you, Director Xu.

234
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,680
I never thought

235
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,680
you could work things out so quickly.

236
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm not wrong about you.

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Don't worry.

238
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
I will do better.

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh, right.

240
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,400
Recently,

241
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,280
I have some funds.

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Think of a way

243
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,040
to withdraw it through your company.

244
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,400
What's wrong?

245
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
Is it a big amount?

246
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,600
It's not.

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll tell you

248
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
the details later.

249
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Do you have any problems?

250
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,720
No, I don't.

251
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,120
Leave it to me.

252
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,080
You may go now.

253
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
Why are you here?

254
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,080
I called but you didn't answer.

255
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
So I thought I might drop by.

256
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,880
Are you coming in for work?

257
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,040
Yes.

258
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,880
But I have some documents to sort out.

259
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Why don't you come in?

260
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay.

261
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Good morning, Jiang Xiao Ning.

262
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,680
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

263
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,480
I didn't know you are here.

264
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,720
I saw nothing.

265
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,520
It's fine.

266
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
You came at the right time.

267
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Ask Yan Yan out for me again.

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,200
Mr. Xu.

269
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,760
Please don't make things difficult for me.

270
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,760
Sister Yan Yan

271
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,960
almost had me killed the last time.

272
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
What's with that death stare?

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,080
She's my assistant.

274
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,280
Look at you being protective of her.

275
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
Fine.

276
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
You don't have to help me.

277
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,760
I have my dignity.

278
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll think of a way myself.

279
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll give you two some time alone.

280
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Bye.

281
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,120
Oh, right.

282
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,200
My notebook.

283
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
I think I left it here.

284
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Did you see it?

285
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,120
He just took it.

286
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Don't worry.

287
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
He'll return it to you.

288
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,840
No, what brings you here?

289
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,840
Did something happen to Xiao Xu?

290
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,640
No, Xiao Xu is fine.

291
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,880
Don't worry.

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,600
That's a relief.

293
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,560
I was wondering

294
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
why did you come all of a sudden.

295
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,680
You will be released

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,920
after a few days.

297
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,720
I might get too busy with work

298
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,000
to come and pick you up.

299
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
I had some free time today

300
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,040
so I came to visit.

301
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Thank you.

302
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Anyway...

303
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,320
Earlier on,

304
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
Xiao Xu came to see me.

305
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
He told me that

306
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,760
you have been good to him.

307
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
And that you trust him a lot

308
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,200
by entrusting him with the company.

309
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
He should be visiting you.

310
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,080
I told him.

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,440
No matter what,

312
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,960
you're still his father.

313
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
Thank you.

314
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,640
All these years,

315
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm glad I have you.

316
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,160
Tang.

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
You're sounding like a stranger now.

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,640
We are friends.

319
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,280
We are like brothers.

320
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,800
What I promised you,

321
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,760
I will see it through.

322
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,200
I really do see Xiao Xu

323
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,080
as my own son.

324
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
Nice earrings.

325
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,240
It's matching

326
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,960
my outfit today.

327
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,360
Qi Hong.

328
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,680
Miss Su.

329
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,080
Where is Jiang Xiao Ning?

330
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,840
I think she went out.

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,360
You think?

332
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,400
Yes.

333
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,280
Wang Kai informed me

334
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,240
a few days ago

335
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,320
that Jiang Xiao Ning's

336
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
working hours and work tasks

337
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
will be arranged by Mr. Gu.

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,720
So she doesn't need to punch in.

339
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,680
Okay. Carry on with your work.

340
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
That was scary.

341
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,800
Boss.

342
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,160
Do you need my help?

343
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,920
No.

344
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
I'll wait for you then.

345
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,040
Okay.

346
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,360
What are you reading?

347
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm doing my revision.

348
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm about to sit

349
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,400
for my final examinations.

350
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,040
If I don't, I might not be able to graduate.

351
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,880
Boss.

352
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,680
Could I ask you some questions

353
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
when you are free?

354
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,800
Come here.

355
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,960
I don't really understand this.

356
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,520
There are many elements

357
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,800
that cannot be altered in architecture.

358
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,040
For instance, the shape factor of a building

359
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,560
should be lesser than

360
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,160
or equal to 0.4.

361
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll show you.

362
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,680
Look.

363
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,120
This part here

364
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
plays a key role.

365
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
If you don't do it well,

366
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
it will affect...

367
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Affect what?

368
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,640
Boss.

369
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,120
You talked a lot.

370
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
You must be thirsty.

371
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,000
♪Caught off-guard by our first encounter♪

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll get you some water.

373
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,140
♪And the corner of your mouth is lifting♪

374

♪Am I abnormal or are you shining♪

376
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,080
(What is going on?)

377
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,440
(My cheeks are burning.)

378
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
(This is bad.)

379
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,640
(Have I really caught feelings)

380
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,040
(for my boss?)

381
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,820
♪Hmm...♪

382
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
(Why would this happen?)

383
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,720
(There must be something wrong)

384
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,040
(with the mechanical heart.)

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Boss, have some water.

386
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,200
It's fine. I'm not thirsty.

387
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm not thirsty.

388
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I'm sorry, Boss.

389
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,400
For wasting your time.

390
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,920
I'll clean up your table.

391
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
It's a blackout.

393
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,040
Boss.

394
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,400
It's...

395
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
It's not because of me, right?

396
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,720
It's got nothing to do with you.

397
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,320
It's just a short circuit.

398
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
It has always been this way.

399
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,800
It's always been this way?

400
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,319
But this residence

401
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
seems high-end.

402
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,359
I wonder why.

403
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,880
How about this?

404
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll ask the management to come over
and have a look.

405
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,100
(Dr.P)

406
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,540
(Heart rate. One new notification.)
(Monitoring heart rate is rising.)

407
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,480
Are they doing something intense?

408
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,880
I just left and they can't hold themselves back.

409
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,600
But

410
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
will Chuan be okay?

411
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,760
I guess it's just me.

412
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Come on in, please.

413
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,600
There's suddenly a blackout

414
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
for no reason.

415
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,280
Please take a look

416
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,400
to find out the problem.

417
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,520
The electrical panel is...

418
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Where's him?

419
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,760
Do you mean the electrical panel?

420
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,840
I know where it is.

421
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,040
This unit often had blackouts.

422
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
I'll leave it to you guys. Thank you.

423
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,880
Often?

424
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,360
Boss.

425
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,680
Boss.

426
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,200
Boss.

427
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,320
Boss.

428
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,560
Boss.

429
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Could it be that he got an electric shock

430
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
and passed out?

431
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,880
Boss, are you in there?

432
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,200
Boss.

433
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,640
Boss.

434
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,440
Boss, are you there?

435
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,880
It's gorgeous.

436
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,480
What is this?

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't touch it!

438
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,920
Boss.

439
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,920
Who let you in?

440
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I'm sorry, Boss.

441
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,000
You didn't answer when I was calling for you.

442
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,000
I was worried that something had happened

443
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,080
so I went looking for you.

444
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
I never thought

445
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,920
I would have discovered your secret.

446
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
Wh... What secret?

447
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,440
In this very room,

448
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
you must have done...

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,360
live streaming sessions.

450
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
There's no way.

451
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,640
Where are the computers and video equipment?

452
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,520
Go out.

453
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,400
Boss.

454
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Go out.

455
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,000
Boss...

456
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,320
You're not allowed to enter this room

457
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,760
without my permission next time.

458
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,960
And...

459
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,480
I'm not an online streamer.

460
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,360
Then what's this room for?

461
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
This room...

462
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,120
This room is

463
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,280
a virtual reality gaming room.

464
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,280
It's like "Ready Player One".

465
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,560
I know that.

466
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,480
Boss,

467
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,880
you're always so stressed at work,

468
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,560
it's normal to take a break occasionally.

469
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,640
Boss,

470
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,640
are you afraid that someone

471
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
will say you're goofing around?

472
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,320
No,

473
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,680
there's a precedent

474
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,600
for the utilization of virtual reality

475
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,840
in the field of architectural design.

476
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,920
Are you

477
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,520
now conducting research into a spectacular design?

478
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,440
Something groundbreaking?

479
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Impressive.

480
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,200
But rest assured.

481
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,560
As your assistant,

482
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,520
I'll surely help you

483
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,120
to keep it from others.

484
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay?

485
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Okay. Hurry up and head to the office now.

486
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,120
Leave now.

487
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
You wait a second. I'll go get the car.

488
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,360
Wait.

489
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,000
The weather is pretty good today.

490
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
I would like to go take a walk.

491
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Is it okay?

492
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,960
It's not far.

493
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,640
But I already didn't go to work

494
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,480
in the morning,

495
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
If I'm not going to work in the afternoon...

496
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,360
As long as you're with me,

497
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
you've already started working.

498
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,120
Let's go.

499
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,200
Okay.

500
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,600
Last time she told me that she was at work,

501
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,840
then she asked me out here to meet.

502
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Then her workplace

503
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,760
is probably around here.

504
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
As long as there's perseverance filled with love,

505
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm certain that I'll get to see her.

506
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,840
How come only one minute has passed?

507
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
I feel that one year has passed instead.

508
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,440
Love is so torturing.

509
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Why is the wind so strong?

510
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,880
My hair is such a mess.

511
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,240
What's wrong, Boss?

512
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,480
Let's go.

513
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
Go buy milk with me.

514
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,040
Okay.

515
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,400
Hello. Welcome.

516
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,660
(Pure milk)

517
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
Why are you picking so meticulously?

518
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,120
Many aren't able to grab the red packets
for food delivery,

519
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,520
so they're reluctant to order in.

520
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,560
For me, I'll take it to another lower level.

521
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,640
For even an item worth 5 yuan,

522
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
I also need to think it through.

523
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,120
Welcome to the world of the poor.

524
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,360
Boss,

525
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,360
I worked at a convenience store before.

526
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,680
The store manager usually

527
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,480
places the food that's expiring soon at the front.

528
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,800
So you take the one placed at the back,

529
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
it'll be fresher.

530
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
Even though it's expiring soon,

531
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,560
it still needs to be bought, right?

532
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,000
He's apparently a warm-hearted person,

533
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
why is his face always expressionless?

534
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,920
And this.

535
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,040
Jiang Xiao Ning.

536
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,000
Chen Chen.

537
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,600
Why are you here?

538
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,080
The store that we worked together at before

539
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,800
had shut down,

540
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
then I was transferred here.

541
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,360
You...

542
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
How have you been?

543
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,160
I've got a

544
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,200
full-time job.

545
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
I'm with an architectural design company.

546
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,160
So impressive.

547
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,560
Then we should grab something to eat

548
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,520
when you're free.

549
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,560
Okay. Let's talk about it when I'm on my rest day.

550
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,120
Okay.

551
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,640
Wait.

552
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,680
These two are for you.

553
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,560
Thank you.

554
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,800
Then I'll leave first.

555
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,640
Bye-bye.

556
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,320
Bye-bye.

557
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Remember we're going to eat together.

558
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,320
Is he someone you know?

559
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,880
We were in the same faculty in university.

560
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
The same faculty.

561
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,840
The most handsome guy in our university.

562
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Lots of girls want to take pictures with him

563
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
just to post it on Weibo

564
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
and Moments to show off.

565
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,120
Him?

566
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Let's go, Boss.

567
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,080
Let's take one more.

568
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Come.

569
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
Is it that this dimwit is waiting for me?

570
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,800
(Meco Store)

571
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,400
(Meco Store)
Boss,

572
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,680
(Meco Store)
give me a second.

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,440
(The most handsome guy in our university.)

574
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,040
(Lots of girls want to take pictures with him)

575
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,080
(just to post it on Weibo)

576
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,480
(and Moments to show off.)

577
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Boss,

578
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,960
you should try the cherry and berry drink of Meco's.

579
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,400
It tastes really good.

580
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
I've never drunk this kind of drink

581
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,480
which has no nutrition at all.

582
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,640
This fruit tea

583
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,160
contains real tea and fruit juice.

584
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,040
Fruit juice

585
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,960
can provide us with vitamins

586
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,320
and tea can help us to lose weight.

587
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
Just give it a try.

588
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,720
Only girls drink it.

589
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,400
I only drink milk and water.

590
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,560
Boss,

591
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,560
a tasty drink

592
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
will cheer you up.

593
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
Maybe this

594
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
tastes better than milk and water?

595
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,360
Just give it a try.

596
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,920
We came all the way here

597
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
just for it, right?

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,320
Just a sip.

599
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,480
Well, this drink...

600
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,120
Try it.

601
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,960
How is it?

602
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,920
It's so-so.

603
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,880
Is it?

604
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,920
Then give me back.

605
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Give me back if you don't want to drink.

606
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,600
You... You said it's not good...

607
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,120
Boss,

608
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
do you feel better after drinking it?

609
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,360
Stop talking.

610
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
Doesn't it taste good?

611
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,920
Yan Yan.

612
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,640
(Cafe YELLOW Garden Restaurant)

613
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,280
It's such a coincidence.

614
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,720
It's such a coincidence.

615
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,960
Are you waiting for me?

616
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,360
I just arrived here not long ago.

617
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,920
I happened to pass by.

618
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,600
I happened to bump into you.

619
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,160
Bye.

620
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
Don't leave in a hurry.

621
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I was in the wrong last time.

622
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,200
I shouldn't ask Jiang Xiao Ning

623
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,960
to deceive you and ask you out.

624
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,200
I promise I won't dare to do so anymore.

625
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,280
I won't lie to you anymore.

626
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,920
Did you tell a lie today?

627
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,760
I didn't.

628
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,320
Your nose is getting longer.

629
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,240
I saw that

630
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,120
you have been sitting here the whole day.

631
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,520
Wait.

632
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,640
You have been looking at me the whole day?

633
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,200
It's really touching.

634
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,040
Yan Yan,

635
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,000
I know that you have feelings for me.

636
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,200
I've never met someone

637
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,840
who is so thick-skinned.

638
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,760
Let me tell you.

639
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,920
I have no time to spout nonsense with you.

640
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,960
Leave me alone.

641
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,600
Don't follow me.

642
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,960
Women like speaking with a forked tongue.

643
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,920
When you asked me to leave you alone,

644
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,200
you were hoping that I could tag along instead.

645
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,680
Okay. Then you must follow closely.

646
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,360
Didn't you say that women like

647
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
speaking with a forked tongue?

648
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,320
You already ordered me to follow you,

649
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,400
I wouldn't dare to defy

650
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
the order of the queen.

651
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,040
Otherwise, I would be tortured.

652
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,760
Okay.

653
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,520
I think you truly wish to be tortured.

654
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,200
Let's go.

655
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
For the three-dimensional rendering

656
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,000
of the art gallery's design proposal,

657
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
it's basically the situation.

658
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,680
Mr. Gu,

659
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,600
if there's no issue

660
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,480
with the blueprint,

661
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,080
I'll submit the proposal.

662
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,200
Tomorrow is the day for the
submission of proposals.

663
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,960
We need to make haste.

664
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,680
Mr. Gu.

665
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,240
Then we'll submit this proposal.

666
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,480
That's it?

667
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,280
Okay.

668
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,260
(Yoga Room)

669
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,520
Are you all right?

670
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,520
I...

671
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,720
You must be kidding.

672
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm completely fine.

673
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
Go and take your bath quickly.

674
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,200
You still need to go home.

675
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,360
How about you?

676
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Me?

677
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,760
I...

678
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,840
I think the environment here is pretty good.

679
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll go and get a membership card done later.

680
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,920
Go ahead.

681
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,960
After you.

682
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,440
After you.

683
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,880
I insist.

684
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,600
Okay.

685
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,120
Keep it up.

686
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,160
Be persistent.

687
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,480
Be persistent.

688
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Be persistent.

689
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,080
Be persistent.

690
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,120
Be persistent.

691
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
(Is my aesthetic outdated?)

692
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,840
(Why is this guy handsome?)

693
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,880
What happened to you?

694
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,520
What's wrong?

695
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,320
Is it weird?

696
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
Why don't you stand up?

697
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm tired of walking for 30 years.

698
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,440
Crawling once in a while gives me
a feeling of nostalgia.

699
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,520
What's wrong?

700
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,000
Where did you go?

701
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,600
If I'm to say I came back from the gym,

702
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,400
will you believe it?

703
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
If you said you went with Zhao Yan,
I would believe that.

704
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,040
Chuan,

705
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,440
you're truly the one who knows me well.

706
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,560
Seriously?

707
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
You really can't stand up?

708
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,040
I can.

709
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,040
Let me see if you can stand up now.

710
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Come.

711
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,120
You've got no conscience at all.

712
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,440
That was fast.

713
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,960
Why did you

714
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,520
go to the gym out of the blue?

715
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,280
There are too many

716
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,239
young handsome guys at the gym.

717
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,639
I'm worried about

718
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,040
Yan Yan being alone.

719
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,120
Let me ask you something.

720
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,400
Do you think this look of mine now

721
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,800
is what young people like?

722
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,560
I always like it anyway.

723
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,639
As for whether young people would like it,

724
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,440
I have no idea then.

725
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,920
After all, I'm also an old man.

726
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
Moreover, I truly can't get hold

727
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,880
of the aesthetic of the youngsters nowadays.

728
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,120
Why did you ask me this question all of a sudden?

729
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Could it be that someone

730
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,440
said you're not good-looking?

731
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,120
How could that be possible?

732
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
Nobody dares to say so.

733
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,520
I just wanted

734
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,160
to know your thoughts.

735
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,040
Chuan, don't worry.

736
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,400
You're still my true love.

737
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,120
I just keep Yan Yan company occasionally.

738
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,440
Don't be jealous.

739
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,320
OK. Alright.

740
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,680
Let me show you a photo.

741
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,600
Do you think...

742
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
Do you think this guy looks handsome?

743
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,680
Is he handsome?

744
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
Who is the girl beside him?

745
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
I'm asking you if this guy is handsome.

746
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,680
Pretty handsome.

747
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,560
Who is he?

748
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,080
What if he's compared with me?

749
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Then you still look better.

750
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,880
Bosom buddy.

751
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,320
You're indeed my bosom buddy.

752
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,520
Be gentle.

753
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,160
But if you're compared with him,

754
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,920
your handsomeness seems to be a bit

755
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,880
outdated.

756
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,920
Outdated?

757
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,720
Where are you going, Chuan?

758
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,480
Don't you leave.

759
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,440
Carry me back to your room.

760
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,920
I really can't crawl back to my house.

761
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,160
You're staying the night here again?

762
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,600
Chuan.

763
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,440
Chuan.

764
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Okay. Then you lie here.

765
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,880
It's quite suitable for you.

766
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,160
Chuan.

767
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't be so unfeeling, okay?

768
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,560
You're handsome, okay?

769
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,240
You're not outdated, I am.

770
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,240
Chuan.

771
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,240
Boss, good morning.

772
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,320
Good morning.

773
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,000
What's wrong, Boss?

774
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,080
What is this?

775
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,520
It's a hairpin.

776
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,560
There's a hairpin in your pocket.

777
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,880
Maybe they gave it to me

778
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,240
as a gift when I bought milk yesterday.

779
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,040
Buy milk and get a free hairpin?

780
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,560
Hmm.

781
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,520
How could a hairpin be given with milk?

782
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,240
Come. I'll give it to you then.

783
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,400
Buy milk

784
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,160
and get a free hairpin?

785
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,720
It looks pretty good on me.

786
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,080
Thank you, Boss.

787
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,800
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

788
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,800
Is there anything?

789
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
I just want to know

790
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,440
if you can solve my problem.

791
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
I've discussed this with other designers

792
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,520
in a meeting.

793
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,760
The wall in front of your art gallery

794
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,240
is truly a conundrum.

795
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,160
If it's not demolished,

796
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
it'll affect the aesthetic appeal
of the entire design.

797
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Chuan Design

798
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,120
is considered a top-notch studio in the industry.

799
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,680
And you can't even get the overhaul

800
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
of an art gallery done well?

801
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,160
We set high standards on design.

802
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,000
We don't want to change the proposal easily.

803
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,000
In fact, Ms. Cheng,

804
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,440
we're being responsible for you.

805
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,560
We don't wish

806
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,560
to show you

807
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
an unsatisfactory design.

808
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
Your biggest responsibility towards me

809
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,480
is to keep this wall for me.

810
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
Our company has changed a few designers

811
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,480
along the way.

812
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,320
We've also submitted more than ten proposals.

813
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,440
The problem is attributed to the wall.

814
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,880
Just be honest with me.

815
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,240
Is it that you can't handle that?

816
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,960
That's not the case.

817
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,480
We just hope that you...

818
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't want to listen to this.

819
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
Chuan Design is so well-known.

820
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
My only requirement

821
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,200
is to keep this wall.

822
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,360
You can't even complete

823
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,840
the design of an art gallery.

824
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,440
How disappointing it is!

825
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Ms. Cheng, don't be anxious.

826
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Let's think it through again, okay?

827
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,920
I'll wait for your call then.

828
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,960
In fact, what I want to say is that

829
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,560
now he has finally

830
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
found a girl he likes.

831
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,080
A girl he likes?

832
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Yes.

833
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,200
He even told us that

834
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
the girl is his assistant.

835
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,360
In fact,

836
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,720
he's my son.

837
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
I know him better than anyone.

838
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,840
He, himself might not even know

839
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
he's deeply in love with that girl.

840
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,600
Is she called

841
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,560
Jiang Xiao Ning?

842
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,920
Sister Man Lin.

843
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,240
Is this a newly bought hairpin?

844
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
It's a gift with the purchase of milk.

845
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,840
It looks pretty good on you.

846
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,360
There's a project for you to handle.

847
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,520
Me?

848
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,040
You're not confident?

849
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,120
Then forget about it.

850
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,040
No. I'm willing to accept it.

851
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,280
It's just that...

852
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm not sure

853
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,480
if I can do it well.

854
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,880
But I'll try my utmost.

855
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,120
I can see that you're pretty hardworking.

856
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,560
You've always wanted

857
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
to try your hand at architectural design.

858
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,960
I'm giving you a chance this time

859
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,920
for you to get training.

860
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,320
It lies in your hands

861
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,400
whether you can do it well.

862
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,800
What's the project about?

863
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,000
It's very simple.

864
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,840
This is

865
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,160
the design project for an art gallery.

866
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,600
There is an old wall there and the client doesn't
want it to be demolished.

867
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,960
But if it's not demolished,

868
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,920
our design

869
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,400
won't be presented perfectly.

870
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,600
You

871
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,960
go and convince her to demolish the wall.

872
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
For the rest of the matters, do keep
your wits about you.

873
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,400
You need to play it by ear.

874
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,720
Okay. Thank you, Sister Man Lin.

875
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,240
You can do it.
