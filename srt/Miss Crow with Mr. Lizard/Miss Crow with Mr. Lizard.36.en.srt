21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
Dad,

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
I've always hated you since I was a kid

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
and I always went against you.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,320
But I have never

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
told you this.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Actually, you have always been my hero.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
I have always

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
wanted your approval.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
That's why I partnered with Gu Chuan

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,320
to start a company.

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,640
That's why I returned to Reindeer Group.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
I don't want my hero

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,200
to be an irresponsible man.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,440
For all the things you did back then,

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,200
I could pretend

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
you did it for our family

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,320
and it was a momentary lapse in judgment.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,520
But wrong is wrong.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,320
You have to own up to it.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,200
I don't want my father

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
to end up being one who has no conscience.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you think I've

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,240
had a good time all these years?

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,000
You know what?

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,240
Actually, I have always

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
been beating myself up

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,960
and living with guilt.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Now that it has come to this.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
It has come to this.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
Thankfully.

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,520
You're all grown up now.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,800
You can handle everything on your own.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,680
I have nothing

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,560
to worry about now.

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
All right.

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,960
I'll listen to you.

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
I'll turn myself in.

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,280
Tomorrow morning.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,520
Okay.

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
But...

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,400
you wouldn't try to run away,

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,880
would you?

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm old now

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,960
and this kind of thing has happened.

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,680
Do you think running away will do me any good?

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,440
Son.

67
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,040
I have lived in this house

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,120
for far too long.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
I just

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,600
want to stay quietly in this house

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,440
for another night

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and I'll have no regrets.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,520
Son.

74
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,800
I have wronged you

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,960
and let you down.

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Hello, Director Xu.

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
Tang Xu was just here.

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
I have warned him.

79
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
Yes?

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Jiang Xiao Ning and Gu Chuan?

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,720
Okay, I got it.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,760
All right. I'll go now.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,120
What's wrong?

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
Pack up your things.

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
Let's leave this place.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
Didn't I tell you that I'm not leaving?

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
You have to go.

88
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
What's going on, Dad?

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Are you hiding something from me?

90
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Look.

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,080
Xu Guo Xiang is going to jail and he'll

92
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
definitely drag you into this.

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Wait a second.

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
How do you know that he is going to jail?

95
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
Hold on.

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
See for yourself.

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
And this.

98
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,460
(Account name: Dongjiang Group)

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Have you got home?

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Almost there.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
I'll go and meet you

102
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
after I'm done charging.

103
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,920
I'm going home to get some things for Grandma.

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
Then, I'll go to the hospital to swap shifts.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Why don't we meet in the hospital?

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,040
It's all right.

107
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
You've been running around with me all day.

108
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,040
Just go home and rest.

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
Get some sleep.

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
Don't worry about me.

111
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,880
I must be keeping you company

112
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
so that I can rest assured.

113
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,240
I know you must be in a bad mood.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
But give Xu Cheng Ran

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,800
some time.

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,520
I believe

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,800
he'll be able to talk his dad round.

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I know. I believe Mr. Xu, too.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
That's all for now. I'm hanging up.

120
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
- Open the door! What are you...
- Don't move!

121
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,740
(Gu Chuan)

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,040
(Gu Chuan)
Xiao Ning?

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,480
Who are you?

124
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,440
Where's the evidence?

125
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,120
I have given it to the police.

126
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,560
If that's true,

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,840
things will be different now.

128
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
Don't lie to me.

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,760
None of you can get away with it.

130
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,800
Do you have a death wish?

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,320
Give me the evidence.

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,520
It's not with me.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Xiao Ning, where are you?

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,560
The evidence is with you, right?

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,440
Who are you?

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,680
That's not important.

137
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
What matters

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
is if the evidence is with you.

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,240
Yes.

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
It's with me.

141
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,280
If you dare to

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
lay a finger on Jiang Xiao Ning,

143
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
you won't get the evidence.

144
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
She's not what I want.

145
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,679
Give me the evidence

146
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
and I'll send her back to you.

147
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Remember.

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Come alone.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Don't try to play tricks.

150
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,560
Otherwise, I can't promise

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,840
that you'll see Jiang Xiao Ning

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
in one piece.

153
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Where do I meet you?

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll call you later.

155
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,880
Director Xu.

156
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,760
Where are you going?

157
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
How dare you

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,520
show up in front of me?

159
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,880
You've got a lot of nerve.

160
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm not in the same league as you.

161
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,840
You could actually order the kill on people.

162
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
Let me ask you.

163
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,280
Mr. Jiang and his wife's deaths

164
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,760
are on you, right?

165
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,680
Did your dad

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,640
cook up nonsense again?

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,040
It looks like serving

168
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,960
ten years in jail isn't enough for Tang.

169
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,480
He didn't turn over a new leaf.

170
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
I suggest that

171
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
he should continue

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
serving time in jail.

173
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I'm warning you.

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
Don't lay a finger on my dad.

175
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,680
He took the fall for you

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,440
and served ten years in jail.

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,880
I merely took some money of yours

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
and that isn't enough

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
to make up for his loss!

180
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
Xiao Xu.

181
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
I've told you before.

182
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,920
Don't line your pockets with my money.

183
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm afraid if you do,

184
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,440
you can't come back from that.

185
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,840
Got it?

186
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
You have to pay a great price

187
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,600
for stealing my money.

188
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,960
You killed Xiao Ning's parents

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,360
and got my dad thrown behind bars for ten years.

190
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
I can't let things slide.

191
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,560
Well,

192
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
what are you going to do?

193
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Call the police?

194
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Sure.

195
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,440
But before you do that,

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,800
look at yourself first.

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,000
If I get jailed,

198
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
do you think you can get away with it?

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,880
I wouldn't be here

200
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,800
if I wanted to call the police.

201
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,600
Suits yourself then.

202
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Where are you going?

203
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
It's none of your business.

204
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,760
Dad, going somewhere?

205
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,880
Why are you back here?

206
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,480
All I can say is that

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
nobody understands one's father
better than his son.

208
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,560
Did you forget

209
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
what you promised me?

210
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
I told you

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,440
that I would turn myself in tomorrow morning.

212
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,880
From what I see,

213
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,880
it doesn't seem like it.

214
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Do you really

215
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
want your father

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,760
to be thrown behind bars?

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,120
You did let me down.

218
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,800
Ran Ran.

219
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,640
Actually, things aren't...

220
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,960
Say no more.

221
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,280
You have lied all your life.

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Aren't you tired?

223
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,840
All I know is that

224
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
to achieve great things,

225
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
one needn't stand on trifles.

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,640
The so-called great things

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
are doing things by hook or by crook

228
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,240
and even by killing people for money.

229
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,120
If so, I'll never understand.

230
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,720
Perhaps,

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Tang Xu will resonate with you.

232
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,160
Don't drag me into

233
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,040
your family affairs.

234
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm leaving.

235
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,580
(Police)

236
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,160
No one will get away with it.

237
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Whatever you have to say,

238
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,080
you can say it to the police.

239
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,880
Who called the police?

240
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,920
Me.

241
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,120
(Dad, I'm sorry.)

242
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
(I have been avoiding it.)

243
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,560
(If I had straightened you out sooner,)

244
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,280
(maybe you wouldn't end up like this.)

245
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,400
(Dad, I'm sorry.)

246
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,640
(Please forgive your unfilial son.)

247
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Get on the boat.

248
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
Where's the stuff?

249
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
What's the hurry?

250
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
It's right here.

251
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,920
Let her go first.

252
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,080
Are you all right?

253
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360
Why are you here?

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,600
You can't give them the evidence.

255
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
Don't bother about that.

256
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,000
How would I know

257
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,640
if you had a backup copy?

258
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
Or

259
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,680
if you had called the cops?

260
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,240
The reason I didn't call the police

261
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
is that I wanted to keep it on the down low.

262
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,480
After all,

263
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,920
it was ten years ago.

264
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,240
As long as I can take her away from here,

265
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,360
we'll pretend like

266
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
none of this has ever happened.

267
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Why should I believe you?

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,880
I have no reason to lie.

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
I can abduct her today

270
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
and I can do it anytime again.

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
You'll have to pay a great price if you lie to me.

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,360
Why would I want to lie to you?

273
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,600
Let's go.

274
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
What's the meaning of this?

275
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm sorry, you two.

276
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,880
No one is leaving today.

277
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,840
Do it.

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,920
Are you all right?

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,120
Watch out!

280
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,000
You shouldn't have messed with me.

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,480
Gu Chuan!

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Gu Chuan!

283
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,160
Gu Chuan, wake up!

284
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,680
Gu Chuan!

285
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,000
Gu Chuan!

286
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,520
Gu Chuan, don't scare me!

287
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,960
Gu Chuan!

288
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,440
Gu Chuan!

289
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
Gu Chuan!

290
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
His vital signs

291
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,200
are stable now.

292
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
As to when

293
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
he'll wake up,

294
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,160
we don't know

295
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,120
for sure.

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Hasn't the safe mode

297
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
been activated?

298
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,080
Why would there still be electricity discharge?

299
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Actually,

300
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,160
I've helped him

301
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,760
restore the initial mode.

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,160
His mechanical heart

303
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
has exited the safe mode.

304
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,600
What?

305
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,320
Mr. Gu said,

306
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,120
despite knowing his time left would be cut short,

307
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
at least, he would feel alive.

308
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,800
Also, he gets to feel

309
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,960
real emotions,

310
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,160
instead of living

311
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
like a machine.

(to look you in the eye)

362
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,040
(and say goodbye.)

363
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,320
(Indeed, I'm not an ambitious person.)

364
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,040

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,360
(to bring joy)

(make a good friend,)

368
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
(and fall in love with a girl.)

(Department of Civil Affairs of Jiangdong)

372
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,440
(my dad)

373
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,400

(All of a sudden,)

375
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,720
(I've lost the direction in my life.)

376
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
(Reindeer Group has gone bankrupt)

377
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,720
(and my dad is in jail.)

378
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
(I have to deal with a lot)

379
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,160
(of compensation issues.)

380

(to protect our love.)

(I don't want to be a drag on you)

388
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,080
(and make you suffer with me.)

389
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
(Just leave the agreement here)

390

(after you have signed it.)

391
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,240
(I'll send someone to get it.)

392
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,600
(I hope)

393
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,560
(you'll live)

394
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
(a happy life.)

395
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,600
(Take care. Xu Cheng Ran.)

396
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
Why don't you hide away if you want to leave?

397
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,920
You picked such an easy place to find.

398
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,840
What do you want to do?

399
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,480
Kill yourself?

400
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,800
Is Gu Chuan awake?

401
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,400
Will he

402
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,040
stay like this forever?

403
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,840
How long do you plan to hide from me?

404
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,640
Xu Cheng Ran, do you still love me?

405
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,400
Indeed, your dad has hurt them.

406
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,560
But not you.

407
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,720
Besides,

408
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,520
what do all these have to do with us?

409
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,320
My dad has been arrested

410
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,400
and all his property has been confiscated.

411
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
My family

412
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,320
is broke and ruined now.

413
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,520
And from now on,

414
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,080
no matter where I go,

415
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,080
people will point fingers at me.

416
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,480
There's nothing that I can give to you.

417
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
Why bother coming to see me?

418
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,840
I don't need anything.

419
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,760
All I want is you.

420
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't think

421
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,240
you'll need anything from me.

422
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
All these years,

423
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
I've never believed in love

424
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,560
because I was afraid of getting hurt.

425
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,040
That's why I didn't believe anyone

426
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,760
nor did I believe in eternal love

427
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,520
until I met Xu Cheng Ran.

428
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,560
After being with Xu Cheng Ran,

429
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,920
I don't have to twist open a bottle cap,

430
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
change a light bulb,

431
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,800
nor do I have to eat alone

432
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,440
or walk late at night.

433
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,400
Xu Cheng Ran is

434
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,680
willing to accept me for who I am

435
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,840
and go along with all my ridiculous requests.

436
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
Most importantly,

437
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
he loves my bad temper the most.

438
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
So I was thinking.

439
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,840
If I don't come and find him,

440
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,640
other girls

441
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,840
might steal him from me.

442
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,840
It will all be too late then.

443
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm not that good...

444
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,800
Shut up. Let me finish.

445
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,000
So I came here today

446
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,640
to make it up to him

447
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,040
for all the pain

448
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,400
that I put him through back then.

449
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,400
I...

450
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,400
Zhao Yan...

451
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,880
kneel before Xu Cheng Ran

452
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,680
to ask his hand in marriage.

453
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,680
I hope

454
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,520
he'll come back to me

455
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,800
and let me be his queen again.

456
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,320
He'll always be prepared to let me
take advantage of him

457
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,040
and be at my beck

458
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
and call.

459
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,480
Let me use my lifetime

460
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,280
to love him with all my heart

461
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,600
for all eternity.

462
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,800
Xu Cheng Ran.

463
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,560
Will you marry me?

464
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,800
I do. Of course, I do.

465
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,280
But I've lost my job

466
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
and my company now.

467
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680

There's a meeting at 2 PM.

It's a last-minute meeting. Don't be late.

I'll be waiting for you.

Okay.

490
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Okay.

491
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,520
Here. Take a look.

492
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,400
This.

493
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,620
(Emergency)

494
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,700
(Inpatient Department)

495
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,400
Good morning, Boss.

496
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
Today is Monday.

497
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,480
It's a working day.

498
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,680
So I still have to call you "Boss".

499
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,880
The weather is good today.

500
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,240
You don't have any plans anyway.

501
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,080
The only thing you need to do

502
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,360
is to lie in bed

503
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,760
and have a chat with me.

504
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,360
I'll tell you stories

505
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,240
and news.

506
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
Mr. Xu said,

507
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
Chen Ao,

508
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,720
the young man

509
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
who caused the car accident ten years ago, died.

510
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,400
The police found out

511
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,000
that Xu Guo Xiang

512
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,680
ordered Assistant Liu to do it.

513
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,960
That adds to their list of crimes

514
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
and they'll be given heavy punishments.

515
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,480
I have no idea

516
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,960
how to comfort Mr. Xu.

517
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,440
But don't worry.

518
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,600
Sister Yan Yan will surely

519
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,040
be with him and help him get through it.

520
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
The biggest news of today is that

521
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
I have got my degree certificate.

522
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,840
From now on,

523
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm officially a designer.

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
You feel happy for me, right?

525
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,160
Yesterday, Grandma and Aunty

526
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,280
have moved into our family house.

527
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,600
I stayed there last night.

528
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,120
When I see all those things

529
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,680
that you prepared for me,

530
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,800
lying in the starry room that you made for me,

531
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,880
I would recall

532
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
the old memories.

533
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,920
The doctor said

534
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,760
that Alzheimer's is hereditary.

535
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm afraid that I'll forget you someday.

536
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,280
If you don't want me

537
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,040
to forget you,

538
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,840
then wake up, alright?

539
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,760
All right now.

540
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
It's time for you to listen to the news.

541
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
A well-known Cambridge neuroscientist

542
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,480
recently pointed out

543
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,199
in a large public event in the United Kingdom

544
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,639
that although the human brain
is extremely complex,

545
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,560
the understanding

546
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,720
of various parts of brain cells
is gradually deepening.

547
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,520
If the computer has the function

548
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
of recreating a 100M connection,

549
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,560
it will

550
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
no longer be a dream to transform the brain

551
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,320
into a program code

552
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,240
to survive in the machine.

553
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
Did you hear that?

554
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,120
This new technology

555
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
seems like a good chance

556
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,720
for us.

557
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,760
What if

558
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,080
we convert our consciousness

559
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
into a digital file

560
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,040
and upload it to a computer,

561
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,160
does it mean

562
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,560
we can meet again

563
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,200
in the cloud?

564
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,200
Gu Chuan.

565
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You can hear me, right?

566
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,480
All right.

567
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,240
I'll go downstairs and get some fruits.

568
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,820
(Three years later)

569
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,680
I'm back.

570
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Do you feel tired today?

571
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,520
It's all right.

572
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,840
I went to the construction site today.

573
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,520
Everything goes according to plan.

574
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,680
It's going smoothly.

575
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,800
By the way,

576
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,280
Sister Yan Yan asked me

577
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,200
to accompany her for the prenatal
testing next week.

578
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,240
Shouldn't Xu Cheng Ran

579
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,160
go with him instead?

580
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Sister Yan Yan doesn't

581
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,440
want him to go with her.

582
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,160
Xu Cheng Ran gets all nervous

583
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,400
each time he hears

584
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,040
the baby's heartbeat from the device.

585
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,720
All right then.

586
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
What delicious food did you buy today?

587
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Take a guess.

588
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
Steak?

589
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,200
Why did you get it right again?

590
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,000
That's because

591
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I've got the red wine ready in advance.

592
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
No one can beat

593
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
the chemistry between us.

594
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,520
Are you done charging?

595
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,720
Yes.

596
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,680
Do you want to test it?

597
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,920
Test what?

598
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,240
What can it be?

599
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,280
Here.

600
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,600
There isn't much fluctuation.

601
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,240
Your heart rate

602
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
remains over 80bpm now.

603
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,240
Back then, it would jump up

604
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,760
to over 100bpm when I kissed you.

605
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Does it mean

606
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,600
we can take it to the next level?

607
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,440
What's the rush?

608
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,080
What if

609
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
something goes wrong again?

610
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,120
Fine.

611
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,680
The rules of us getting along

612
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,920
remain unchanged for now.

613
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,080
Keep things the way they are now.

614
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,920
Actually, this is good enough for me.

615
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,400
Once in a while,

616
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
you can drink some wine

617
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,960
and let me kiss and hug you.

618
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,040
I think

619
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,720
we should take one step at a time.

620
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,360
When I'm fully recovered,

621
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,920
we can go directly

622
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,240
from the first to the third base.

623
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
