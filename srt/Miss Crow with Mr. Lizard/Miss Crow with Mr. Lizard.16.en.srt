113
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
The one you had your eye on

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
has been sold.

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,800
It's been sold?

116
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640

As for the design...

118
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
The design

119

doesn't matter now.

120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Mr. Gu, no offense,

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,000
but you seem very different

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,960
from last time.

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,360
Do I?

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,160
Yes.

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
Last time, you seemed

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
determined and persistent.

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,120
I thought we could strike a deal

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,240
for sure.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Although I sell tombs,

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I think the fewer

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,960
cemeteries sold, the better.

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
After all, if you can live,

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
no one would choose to die.

134
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Isn't that right?

135
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,120
Stop thinking about disappearing.

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
Just like my parents.

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,640
They were never gone.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
They will always be here.

139
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,880
I once saw

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
the light in your eyes.

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
It's a happiness

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,320
that I wish

143
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,560
would never disappear.

144
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,760
I don't want to lose that light.

145
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,200
Mr. Gu.

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Do you still want to have a look at another one?

147
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll reconsider it.

148
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,040
Thank you.

149
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,840
Please do

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,680
reconsider it.

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
Sir, there is a traffic jam ahead.

152
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,600
What about making a left turn
and taking another route?

153
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,559
Sure, go ahead.

154
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
(I made a detour,)

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,000
(but I didn't waste time.)

156
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,320
(Even if I had to pay more than others,)

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
(but I believe)

158
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,440
(as long as I keep moving forward,)

159
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
(I will reach my goal.)

160
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240

161
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
(another way to go)

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
(in life as well?)

163

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Great!

174
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,360
Thank you.

175
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,640
You should just get back to work.

176
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,280
What's wrong with him?

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,640
All right.

178
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
You know very well

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,160
what kind of a person he is.

180
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,480
He is a stiff man who doesn't know

181
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
how to have fun.

182
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Moreover,

183
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
he has won so many awards.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Winning the Jin An Award

185
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,680
is no big deal.

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,280
Indeed.

187
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,240
Is something

188
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,800
bothering Mr. Gu?

189
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
He...

190
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
He is always like this.

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,200
You know him

192
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,080
better than anyone.

193
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,320
Stop standing there.

194
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,240
Get back to your work.

195
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
Okay!

196
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Let's go.

197
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Let's go.

198
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,440
Mr. Xu.

199
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
Do you need me to work today?

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
That was the plan.

201
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,600
But we're celebrating Gu Chuan's success,

202
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,360
so it's better to leave the work aside for now.

203
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,200
Okay.

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,960
I'll carry on with my script.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.

206
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,680
It's such a pity

207
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,840
that my beautiful eyes

208
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,960
can never see through your heart.

209
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
It's such a pity

210
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
that my heart is an impregnable fortress.

211
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,040
No one can see through it.

212
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,640
Sorry.

213
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,760
What is it?

214
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
What?

215
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,400
You've won

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
the Jin An Award.

217
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
What is your next plan?

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,720
After winning the Jin An Award,

219
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,640
I will continue my plan.

220
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,360
Chuan,

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,760
do you know this adage?

222
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
Plans always fall behind changes.

223
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,320
What changes?

224
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,200
Over the years,

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I noticed

226
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,600
that you've been changing.

227
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,080
So

228
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,320
as your dearest brother

229
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
and as a friend who loves you

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
and you love the most,

231
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,400
I must remind you

232
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
that it's time to

233
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,680
change your unreliable plan.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,720
Even if I changed the plan,

235
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,160
the outcome would stay the same.

236
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,640
It's going to happen sooner or later.

237
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,080
The more time you have, the better your chance is.

238
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,480
Moreover,

239
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
even if you don't care about yourself,

240
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,960
at least be considerate of those around you.

241
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,720
Are you going to leave me

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,520
and your parents behind?

243
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Or, are you going to

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
leave the Chuan Studio

245
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,320
and those

246
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,600
who fought by your side behind?

247
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,920
What about Jiang Xiao Ning?

248
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
She is still young.

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,880
She has neither a degree

250
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
nor a family of her own.

251
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
You act like a father figure all the time.

252
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,200
Are you going to leave her

253
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,040
and let her go?

254
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Just think about it.

255
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Why are you still here?

256
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,520
I was waiting to drive you home.

257
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Don't bother.

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm busy.

259
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Let me drive you there.

260
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,040
Boss.

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,440
Are you feeling unhappy

262
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,600
because you've won enough awards?

263
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Or, is there something else

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,840
that is even more upsetting?

265
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
You've been pulling on a long face the whole day.

266
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,920
Have I?

267
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,080
You should look at yourself in the mirror.

268
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
You're wearing a worried frown.

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,360
Boss.

270
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,360
Are you sure you don't need a ride?

271
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,760
Yes, I've called a taxi.

272
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,720
You should go home.

273
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,720
What about tomorrow morning?

274
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,920
Wait for my notice.

275
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,640
Okay.

276
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,280
Boss.

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,840
I don't know

278
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
why you're upset,

279
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,280
but I must tell you this.

280
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Congratulations.

281
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,840
No matter what happened,

282
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,040
achieving a dream

283
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,520
is never a bad thing.

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,000
Right?

285
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,640
What if achieving a dream

286
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
is a bad thing?

287
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,480
Why would it be

288
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,560
a bad thing?

289
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,520
Because you would no longer have a goal.

290
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,880
That's simple.

291
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,080
Just set another goal for yourself.

292
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Take me for an example.

293
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
My dream is to go skiing.

294
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,400
And

295
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,440
my dream has come true.

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,840
I also want to graduate

297
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,960
and get my certificate.

298
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,120
I also want to become an outstanding

299
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,040
architectural designer

300
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
like you.

301
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,520
Boss.

302
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
When it concerns a dream,

303
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,880
you can go with a greater goal.

304
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,520
If it takes you some time

305
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,400
to figure it out,

306
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,880
I wouldn't mind

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,240
spending some of my time and energy

308
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
to provide you

309
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,200
with some reasonable advice

310
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
for your reference.

311
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
I look forward to your advice.

312
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,320
Sure.

313
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,240
No problem, Boss.

314
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
I'll keep it in mind.

315
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,480
Sir, I'll leave him to you.

316
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,640
Drive safely.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,560
Boss.

318
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,400
See you tomorrow.

319
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
Stay safe.

320
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,319
Shouldn't you be in bed now?

321
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,720
I couldn't sleep.

322
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,119
What could be so exciting

323
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,839
that it keeps my son awake at night?

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,119
I've won an award.

325
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,200
I've won the Jin An Award.

326
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,480
Really?

327
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,000
Gu!

328
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,640
Come here, your son has won an award!

329
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,280
What is it?

330
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,040
Hurry!

331
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,839
What did he win this time?

332
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,280
The Jin An Award.

333
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,040
Really?

334
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,560
If he had won such a prestigious award,

335
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,400
wouldn't he put a smile

336
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,440
on his face?

337
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,320
Are you sure?

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Don't be silly.

339
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,160
When did he ever

340
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,840
lie to us

341
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
with such a serious matter?

342
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
Then he just doesn't want to see me.

343
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,520
You two carry on.

344
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,680
Father.

345
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,560
Come here.

346
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,000
He asked for you.

347
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,560
Father, I am telling you this great news

348
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
because I'm very happy.

349
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,360
I just found it hard

350
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,080
to smile for the camera.

351
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
Then don't smile.

352
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
I remember when you

353
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,760
went on stage for the awards when you were little,

354
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,240
I never saw you smile either.

355
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Are you serious?

356
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,560
It's different.

357
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,600
It's an international award!

358
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,920
Gu, what's got into you?

359
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,040
Xiao Chuan.

360
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,240
You don't need

361
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,760
all the success and glory.

362
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,120
Don't be so tense all the time.

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,440
It's bad for your mental health.

364
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Not to mention you've won

365
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,880
so many awards at a young age.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
Your career

367
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,760
is taking off.

368
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,840
You should be content.

369
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,400
I am.

370
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,320
Father.

371
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,400
Mother.

372
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,160
You must be very disappointed in me.

373
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,800
Nonsense.

374
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,000
As your parents,

375
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,840
we are both

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,920
very proud of you.

377
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,320
After so many years,

378
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,440
I never listened to your advice.

379
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
I didn't get married

380
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,080
or become a father.

381
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
I don't even

382
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,800
live with you.

383
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,360
My son.

384
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
When it comes to your life,

385
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,760
there are no set rules

386
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
that you must abide by.

387
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,360
But as Chinese parents,

388
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,600
we do

389
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
have a standard to follow.

390
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,480
Which is

391
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
to avoid causing

392
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,120
our children any trouble

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
when they grow up.

394
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,560
Xiao Chuan, remember this.

395
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,080
As long as you are well,

396
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,960
your mother and I

397
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,400
will always be happy and proud of you.

398
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,280
We'll be content.

399
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
Thanks, Father.

400
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,040
My sight is getting blur.

401
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,760
Xiao Chuan.

402
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,000
What's wrong?

403
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,680
It's nothing, Mother.

404
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I just...

405
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,440
I miss you.

406
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,840
We miss you too.

407
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,960
Give yourself a break

408
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,880
when you have time.

409
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,120
Get some rest.

410
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
I'll take a long break someday.

411
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,960
You should take some rest too.

412
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400
Take care.

413
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
Don't stay up too late.

414
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
Chuan, are you ready yet?

415
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
They are about to start.

416
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Not bad.

417
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
What do you think, Jiang Xiao Ning?

418
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Do I have good taste?

419
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

420
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,400
So handsome.

421
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,400
Of course.

422
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
I picked it for him.

423
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,440
You're really handsome.

424
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,200
All right.

425
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,040
Wipe your drool.

426
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,520
Let's go.

427
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,480
I never thought that

428
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
so many architectural designers would be here.

429
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,400
I must record this.

430
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
I might not have

431
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,480
another chance to see so many designers this life.

432
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,560
Boss.

433
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,960
Who are the most

434
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,520
renowned designers here today?

435
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,720
Over there.

436
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,160
We have William from the UK.

437
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,960
Team Sky from Austria.

438
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Liu Li Ming.

439
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,480
And from the U.S.,

440
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,920
the team of

441
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
Richard Barn Architecture.

442
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,240
There are also

443
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
Gu Chuan and his assistant.

444
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,560
I hereby announce

445
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,000
the Sixth Jin An Awarding Ceremony

446
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,880
officially begins!

447
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,040
First of all,

448
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,280
please turn your attention to the screen.

449
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,600
Look!

450
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Look at the crowd.

451
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
There are so many foreigners.

452
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,120
Right?

453
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
So ignorant.

454
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
There are so many

455
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,520
real estate tycoons.

456
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,640
The damage

457
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,720
caused by melting glaciers

458
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,880
is enormous.

459
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,880
With global warming,

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,240
the rising sea level and melting glaciers

461
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,640
have destroyed

462
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,000
the natural habitat of animals

463
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
like polar bears.

464
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
They are facing

465
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
starvation.

466
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,050
(Environmental Awareness)

467
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
the theme of our ceremony

469
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,080
for this year is

470
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,040
"Protect it,

471
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,680
It's Our Home.

472
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,280
Save the Earth.

473
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,360
Protect the Environment."

474
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,360
That's Mr. Xu!

475
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
Look, he is so handsome.

476
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,720
Have some water.

477
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,920
Our awarding ceremony

478
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,160
will officially begin.

479
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,200
First of all,

480
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
we'll start with

481
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,000
the Lifetime Achievement Award.

482
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
Let's welcome

483
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,680
our award winner,

484
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,600
(Lifetime Achievement Award)
Ginobili Weir!

485
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's welcome him!

486
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
Congratulations.

487
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Thank you.

488
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm delighted to receive this award.

489
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,880
I wish to thank

490
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,320
everyone who made it possible.

491
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,280
Thank you.

492
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,360
Another round of applause for him.

493
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
The next award

494
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
is the most

495
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
important award of tonight,

496
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,160
the Jin An Designing Award.

497
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,400
Let's welcome

498
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,200
our presenter, the CEO

499
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
of the Jin An Award Foundation,

500
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,560
Mr. James May,

501
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,240
to present the award.

502
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,160
Let's welcome him.

503
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,480
Good evening, everyone.

504
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,360
Gold Coast Award is committed

505
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,000
to honoring and encouraging

506
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
some of the world's most elite young design talents.

507
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,760
This award ceremony has been running

508
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,880
for six years now, and in that time

509
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,200
we've honored

510
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,400
some of the most exciting

511
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,600
design works

512
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,080
and designers from amongst
the designing community.

513
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,280
Tonight, it is my greatest honor

514
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,080
to award the biggest award to

515
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,000
Mr. Gu Chuan!

516
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,600
From Chuan Design Studio!

517
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,600
Boss, go get it.

518
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
Congratulations.

519
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Stop filming.

520
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,200
It's a formal occasion.

521
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,040
Just applaud first.

522
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,480
Thank you.

523
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,000
Well?

524
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,080
Do I have a good taste in men?

525
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,040
Mr. Xu, don't be so full of yourself.

526
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't say it out loud.

527
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:03,520
♪Walk across this empty space and take a chance♪

528
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,080
Hi! My name is Gu Chuan.

529
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,920
I hope that designers from China

530
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,840
can do more than just

531
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,040
showing some so-called

532
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,800
eye-catching uniqueness of China.

533
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,560
Do not be content

534
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,040
with superficial symbols.

535
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,640
I hope they can present

536
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,040
the wisdom and the thoughts

537
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,280
that come from

538
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,240
our rich culture.

539
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,920
Over the decades,

540
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,600
designers from China

541
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
have been learning from the West.

542
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,000
They are using architectures

543
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,120
from the West as reference

544
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,880
to plan the construction

545
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,080
and the buildings of our cities.

546
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,640
We are learning

547
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,360
the design concept of the West,

548
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,040
but these buildings

549
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,680
have a far greater reputation in China

550
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,320
than they are in foreign lands.

551
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
We have

552
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,880
entered a new phase.

553
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,800
People will begin

554
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,880
to consider one thing.

555
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
That is how this modernization

556
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,000
can be linked to the culture

557
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,840
the history,

558
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,880
and our lifestyle

559
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,920
that we're having right now?

560
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,440
China is a country with a rich

561
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
and fascinating history.

562
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,080
History has great value

563
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,120
in modern days.

564
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,640
In the process of learning from history,

565
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,480
great creativity will be inspired.

566
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
This will have an impact on the whole world.

567
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
When we're talking about a design from China,

568
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I hope that everyone

569
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,800
will not just talk about its
geographical meanings,

570
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,520
but try to ponder

571
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,960
its cultural meanings.

572
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,480
Because it has

573
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,720
so much wisdom of the past

574
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,960
in it.

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
The designs from China

576
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,280
will continue to push forward

577
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,880
creativity in cultural and social spheres.

578
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,840
Our buildings will slowly

579
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
shift away from materialistic

580
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,360
and modular design.

581
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,320
In the future,

582
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,280
new praxis

583
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,840
and new cultural needs

584
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,200
will promote

585
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,800
more variations in architecture design.

586
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,440
Thank you.

587
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,280
Great!

588
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Impressive!

589
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
That was amazing!

590
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
What an inspiring speech!

591
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,040
Now that you have

592
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,360
won the greatest award tonight.

593
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
It can be said that you've

594
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,760
won the Grand Slam.

595
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
Could you tell us

596
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,120
do you have

597
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,000
any future plans

598
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
that you'd like to share with us?

599
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,200
My future plans?

600
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,920
I don't have one yet.

601
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,880
I've been waiting

602
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,120
for a piece of advice

603
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,400
about my future plan.

604
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,880
Thank you, Mr. Gu Chuan,

605
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,280
for your wonderful speech.

606
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,560
Congratulations again!

607
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,200
Give him a like.

608
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,720
Great.

609
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,520
Give him a like.

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,320
Did you notice?

611
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,880
When Mr. Gu was giving the speech,

612
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,640
he was looking at Jiang Xiao Ning!

613
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,760
Why would he look at her

614
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,640
when talking about his future plans?

615
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Could it be...

616
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,680
Cut it out!

617
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,840
Are you a choir?

618
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,560
No.

619
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,840
Don't be ridiculous.

620
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Please.

621
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,800
Boss just wants to

622
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,760
give his assistant

623
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,920
some motivation.

624
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,080
Isn't that normal?

625
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,680
How is this not normal?

626
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,800
Wait.

627
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,960
You people,

628
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,480
do you know what this is?

629
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,920
It's called a legacy.

630
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,240
It's his hope for the future!

631
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
For the younger generation!

632
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,440
The younger generation!

633
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,840
Is that so?

634
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,280
You, Sister Man Lin, and Ms. Cheng

635
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
are still young too.

636
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,560
Why aren't they...

637
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,640
Jia Jia.

638
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,680
Su Man Lin and Ms. Cheng

639
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,040
are already very outstanding.

640
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Brother Kai, you got so serious.

641
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
I've never got an award anyway.

642
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,840
Thank you.

643
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,920
Mr. Gu.

644
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,480
Your speech

645
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
was so inspiring.

646
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520
We've been

647
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,480
clapping for you down there.

648
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,240
Chuan.

649
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,160
You were amazing.

650
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,880
Let's go.

651
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
Let's go to the after-party.

652
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
I've asked the colleagues

653
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,720
to go there first.

654
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,320
Go on without me.

655
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,480
What's wrong with him?

656
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,880
Don't worry. Leave him be.

657
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
Let's go over and wait for them.

658
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,200
Boss.

659
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,320
I don't know where are they

660
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,400
having the after-party.

661
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,400
I'll ask Mr. Xu.

662
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,520
We're not going there.

663
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,240
Where are we going then?

664
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,920
Somewhere quiet.

665
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,360
Is he here yet?

666
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,080
No.

667
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,280
Call him again.

668
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,159
Okay.

669
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Boss.

670
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,440
Do you like this place?

671
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,960
It's not bad.

672
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,400
It's quiet.

673
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,639
This is a good place to think.

674
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,560
It's also a great place...

675
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,240
(to confess my love.)

676
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,760
A great place of what?

677
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,480
Nothing.

678
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,080
(Jiang Xiao Ning.)

679
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,280
(Aren't you always brave?)

680
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,840
(The timing)

681
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,040
(and this place.)

682
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,680
(Isn't this the perfect chance?)

683
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,920
(Why are you)

684
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
(being a coward right now?)

685
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,960
(Aren't you going)

686
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,400
(to pursue your love?)

687
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,800
Boss.

688
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
Do I have a place

689
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,480
in your future plans?

690
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,240
Because

691
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,600
I like you.

692
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,440
I know I'm a little impulsive.

693
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,720
But I've thought a lot

694
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,120
about our relationship.

695
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,480
I don't deserve you

696
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
with my current qualifications,

697
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,440
but whether as a friend

698
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,120
or an employee,

699
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,560
I've always admired you.

700
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,400
I studied hard and worked hard

701
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,640
to become a better person

702
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,600
only to narrow the gap

703
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,560
between us.

704
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,360
Seeing you every day

705
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,200
becomes my only motivation.

706
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,880
I don't know

707
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,120
what I should do.

708
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,040
I don't think I'm thinking straight now.

709
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,400
I mean...

710
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
You like me?

711
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm not going to force you to give me an answer.

712
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,120
I just got a little impulsive.

713
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,600
I can't think straight.

714
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,720
You don't have to answer me.

715
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,200
I'm thinking about many things.

716
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,840
I'm in a dilemma.

717
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,480
So...

718
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,520
Jiang Xiao Ning.

719
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,800
Just focus on your work for now.

720
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,360
There are some things

721
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,760
I haven't worked it out yet.

722
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,680
I'll talk to you after I've thought them through.

723
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
After you joined our company,

724
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,600
I've seen your efforts.

725
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,840
I can see

726
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,360
what you've done great.

727
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,400
It's not about work.

728
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,640
It's getting late.

729
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,600
Go home.

Don't lean on me! It is hot!

747
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
I just want to hug you.

748
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,680
What's wrong?

749
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,120
Tired from work?

750
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,600
It's not the job.

751
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,520
However,

752
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,960
I think I've done something stupid.

753
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,520
No way.

754
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,360
You're the smartest girl.

755
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,840
Right?

756
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,760
You little smarty.

757
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,280
You're the most reliable girl.

758
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,360
It's just a mistake.

759
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,040
Just forget it

760
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,240
and start over.

761
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,800
Not everything

762
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,040
can be redone.

763
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,720
I was too reckless.

764
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,120
I was unreasonable.

765
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,440
I took it the wrong way.

766
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,840
It's all my fault.

767
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
Listen to my advice.

768
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,560
What about getting another job?

769
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
I know your boss

770
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
is treating you well.

771
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,320
But look at

772
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,080
what you've become.

773
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
This job is

774
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,640
much more tiring than those

775
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,640
part-time jobs.

776
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,320
You were never this tired.

777
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,000
I can't quit.

778
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,560
Unless Boss fires me.

779
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
I want to become an architectural designer.

780
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,600
I can't quit.

781
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,440
So this is

782
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,320
why you're

783
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,440
staying in that company?

784
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
It used to be the reason.

785
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
But not anymore.

786
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,120
Aunty.

787
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll go take a shower.

788
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,920
Don't worry.

789
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,840
I have to work tomorrow.

790
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,640
Rest well.

791
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,560
You are always

792
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,200
so stubborn.

793
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,960
Only telling the good news.

794
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,240
Refuse to tell me your worries

795
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,880
and only tell me the good news.

796
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,800
That's because

797
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,920
I can handle it.

798
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,080
I'll go take a shower.

799
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,600
Let me know if you need anything.

800
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,520
Okay.

801
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,480
Jiang Xiao Ning.

802
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,240
May all your wishes

803
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,760
come true.

804
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Jiang Xiao Ning.

805
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,280
May all your wishes

806
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,920
come true.

807
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,240
Jiang Xiao Ning.

808
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,400
You either work hard

809
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,600
or get lost.

810
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,280
Jiang Xiao Ning.

811
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
You either work hard

812
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,680
or get lost.

813
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,840
You must be Mr. Gu.

814
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,920
Do you need a designated driver?

815
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,160
You can keep it if you like it.

816
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,240
That's the last one.

817
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,920
Mr. Gu.

818
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,560
Mind the speed bump.

819
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,560
Mr. Gu, this is for you.

820
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,200
May you be happy and healthy.

821
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,040
(I like my boss.)

822
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,440
(I like the company too.)

823
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,880
(I will do my best.)

824
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Because...

825
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,680
I like you.

826
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
(If someone)

827
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,600
(has been living in the dark for almost ten years,)

828
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,920
(for him,)

829
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,120
(it would be normal to despair.)

830
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,160
(He won't be afraid.)

831
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,040
(He won't worry about gains and losses.)

832
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,280
(But when he gets to see the light again,)

833
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,080
(he won't be able to live)

834
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,080
(without the light.)

835
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,160
(So, Jiang Xiao Ning,)

836
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,880
(it's not that I wouldn't listen to you.)

837
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,000
(It's just that)

838
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
(I don't have the courage to listen to you.)

839
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,880
(Because I am a man)

840
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
