the photographer she mentioned

31

was you.

Okay.

137
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
Miss Chen, please.

138
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll just cut to the chase.

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,640
You must be Mr. Gu's ex-girlfriend.

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,880
His first love?

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,320
Did you ask me out

142
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
to dig some gossip up on me?

143
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
Back in the office,

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,360
Gu Chuan looked at you

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,400
in a very different way.

146
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,680
I had guessed who you were.

147
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you worried?

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,440
About what?

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,600
That the spark would be reignited between us.

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Not at all.

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm just curious.

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,920
I've been working for Mr. Gu

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,040
since I graduated.

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,840
I started as his assistant.

155
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
It's been

156
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
six to seven years.

157
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,440
He was never in love over this time.

158
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
All I know

159
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,000
is that he had a girlfriend.

160
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
He never got into a relationship again.

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,080
I thought

162
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,320
he got hurt too deeply by that relationship.

163
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,760
But judging by your interaction,

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
you two seemed more like

165
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
two long-lost friends.

166
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,960
Maybe we're not even friends.

167
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
But I must admit.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
He did have good taste

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
back then.

170
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,200
You don't need to flatter me.

171
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,800
This does not

172
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,080
match your

173
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
incisive talking style.

174
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,320
I'll get to the point then.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,520
I can tell you like Gu Chuan.

176
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,240
But he will never choose you.

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
How can you be certain?

178
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
Because I know him better.

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,720
It was

180
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,120
over ten years ago.

181
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,280
How do you know it was ten years ago?

182
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
Were you overhearing?

183
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
From my understanding,

184
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,040
Gu Chuan will never be in love with

185
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,640
someone who is overbearing and wily.

186
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,960
I would choose Jiang Xiao Ning
if I were him.

187
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,720
Don't eat too much.

188
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
It might be bad for your health.

189
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,280
(Remember)

190
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
(what I told you the other day?)

191
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,120
(What was it?)

192
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
(Be brave.)

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,320
(You've chosen the right person.)

194
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,680
Jiang Xiao Ning.

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
Why are you being absent-minded again?

196
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm not.

197
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,920
I was thinking about work.

198
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
(I'll get to the point then.)

199
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,760
(I can tell you like Gu Chuan.)

200
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,840
(But he will never choose you.)

201
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,640
(From my understanding,)

202
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
(Gu Chuan will never be in love with)

203
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,120
(someone who is overbearing and wily.)

204
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
(I would choose Jiang Xiao Ning
if I were him.)

205
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,240
Jiang Xiao Ning.

206
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Is something bothering you?

207
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,320
Actually,

208
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,360
it's something good.

209
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,440
However...

210
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
What is it?

211
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm not ready to tell you yet.

212
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll tell you another time.

213
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,880
Okay.

214
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
You should go to bed early.

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
Boss.

216
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
What is it?

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
(Jiang Xiao Ning.)

218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,680
(Didn't you said that you'll be brave?)

219
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,880
The truth is...

220
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,480
I...

221
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
Boss, I need to answer this call.

222
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,680
Please give me a second.

223
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

224
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,720
You must be thinking

225
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,880
this new friend of yours

226
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,400
can help you out

227
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,160
and bring the company more projects.

228
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,000
I bet you're overjoyed.

229
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,480
I don't understand what you're saying.

230
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,800
You're

231
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,000
shooting yourself in the foot.

232
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,240
What?

233
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,720
I don't get it.

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Think about it.

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
She just happened to appear by the lake

236
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,720
and took a photo of you.

237
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,320
She just happened to hold a
photography exhibition,

238
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
asking you to be her designer.

239
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,480
So many coincidences.

240
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,680
That's only because

241
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
she just happened to be

242
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
Mr. Gu's ex-girlfriend.

243
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
She was willing to get close to you

244
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,920
and become your friend.

245
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,480
You must be thinking

246
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
she is a friend who understands you.

247
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,720
Jiang Xiao Ning.

248
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,720
She is using you

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,360
and you haven't realized it yet.

250
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,000
Try to recall.

251
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
Her qualification and erudition,

252
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
her social class and the way she talks,

253
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
even her past with Mr. Gu.

254
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
You're beneath her in every aspect.

255
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
Jiang Xiao Ning.

256
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,360
You're so naive.

257
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,480
You're the powder keg

258
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,760
to reignite their love,

259
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,720
do you get it now?

260
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,880
It's time to wake up, Jiang Xiao Ning.

261
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Jiang Xiao Ning.

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,000
What's wrong with you?

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,920
It's nothing, Boss.

264
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Aunty?

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
I'll be right back.

266
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,040
I'll bring you some late-night snacks.

267
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
What were you trying to say?

268
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,360
It was nothing, Boss.

269
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,160
I have to go now.

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
Goodbye, Boss.

271
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
What's wrong?

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Did someone bully you?

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
It's nothing, Sister Yan Yan.

274
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,760
I don't want to talk about it.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,560
I'll go home

276
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,760
after a while.

277
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,640
It's alright.

278
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
You don't have to tell me.

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
You can stay as long as you want.

288
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
(Nothing, Boss.)

289
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
(I have to go now.)

290
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,240
(Goodbye, Boss.)

291
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,560
Charging.

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,720
(Say nothing.)

293
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
(It's in the bottle.)

(It's inside of me.)

295
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,720
(Say nothing.)

296
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,200
(It's in the bottle.)

297
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
(It's inside of me.)

298
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,680
What's wrong, Sister Yan Yan?

299
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,480
Have I been sleeping for a long time?

300
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,880
Something is wrong

301
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,880
with Xu Cheng Ran.

302
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
What's wrong with him?

303
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,720
Check his Moments.

304
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,000
Nothing special. Just a post.

305
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
He seems happy.

306
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,040
Let me see it.

307
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,100
(I can't take it anymore. I'm too dashing for my age.)

308
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
Do you know where he lives?

309
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
Huayi Hotel, Room 3909.

310
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm going out.

311
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Where are you going?

312
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,560
I'll be right back.

313
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,360
Mr. Xu, I...

314
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
I'll get help!

315
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,640
No!

316
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Don't get help!

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,720
You got it all wrong!

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Hold on!

319
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,360
Stop!

320
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
You got it all wrong!

321
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
Don't get help!

322
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,600
Don't...

323
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Come back here. I don't need help!

324
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,040
Xu Cheng Ran.

325
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,840
Xu Cheng Ran!

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Sorry.

327
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,600
Sorry for the trouble.

328
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,680
Have a nice day.

329
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,920
Yan Yan.

330
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,720
Yan Yan.

331
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,400
I...

332
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,800
It was just a joke.

333
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Please don't be mad.

334
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't use violence!

335
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,720
The door is still open.

336
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,440
They haven't gone far.

337
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,680
It was embarrassing enough just now.

338
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,360
Don't make the situation even worse.

339
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,560
So you know it's embarrassing.

340
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,520
You know it's embarrassing?

341
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,280
You're embarrassing!

342
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
It's not that bad.

343
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,800
Xu Cheng Ran.

344
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,520
How can you be so disgusting?

345
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,480
You're the worst!

346
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,760
No.

347
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,440
I was just trying to...

348
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,000
ease the tension.

349
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Fine.

350
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,760
Yan Yan!

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,760
You've already

352
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,280
seen everything about me.

353
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,800
You can't

354
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,480
just leave me.

355
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,720
You must be responsible

356
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,080
for my life.

357
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,600
Xu Cheng Ran.

358
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,280
Drop the act.

359
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,000
You should be an actor

360
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,920
since you have nothing to do.

361
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,400
Back off!

362
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,960
No!

363
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,920
It's not about my act.

364
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
You care about me.

365
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,560
I do hold a place in your heart.

366
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,400
Right?

367
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360
Do you know The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

368
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,360
I'm telling you.

369
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,960
I won't fall for your trick again!

370
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,720
Back off!

371
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Yan Yan!

372
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,200
Yan Yan, sorry!

373
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,480
Stand up!

374
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,160
No.

375
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,320
There are security cameras here.

376
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,960
Don't you

377
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,680
embarrass me again!

378
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,760
I will kneel forever

379
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,520
if you don't forgive me.

380
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,160
Stand up.

381
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,600
No.

382
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,000
Fine.

383
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Yan Yan!

384
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,800
Yan Yan!

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Yan Yan, open up!

386
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,720
Yan Yan!

387
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
It will be embarrassing

388
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
if someone sees me in the corridor!

389
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,880
Yan Yan?

390
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,480
Yan Yan?

391
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,640
Hello, Sir.

392
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Do you need help?

393
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,720
I lost my contact lens.

394
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,360
I'm looking for it.

395
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,280
I'll help you.

396
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,000
Never mind.

397
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,600
Forget it.

398
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,440
Carry on with your work.

399
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,560
Very well. Goodbye.

400
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,360
Yan Yan.

401
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

402
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,400
Let go of me!

403
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,360
No way.

404
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
Don't lock me out.

405
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,360
Yan Yan!

406
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,560
Yan Yan...

407
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
Yan Yan!

408
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,560
Yan Yan! I'm sorry!

409
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Yan Yan...

410
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Please let me in, Yan Yan.

411
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,880
I...

412
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,440
Jiang Xiao Ning.

413
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,120
Why are you coming home late?

414
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,640
Stop right there!

415
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,920
Are you ignoring

416
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
your own aunt now?

417
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,720
Are you too mature

418
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,600
to talk to your aunt now?

419
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,760
Say something.

420
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,600
What's wrong?

421
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,360
What happened?

422
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
Why did you cry?

423
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,840
No.

424
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
It's nothing.

425
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

426
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,480
You've never lied to me.

427
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,120
Tell me.

428
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,880
Who is bullying you?

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,680
Who is bullying you?

430
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,520
I'll make them pay.

431
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm smart.

432
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,280
No one dares to bully me.

433
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,240
Why were you crying?

434
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
Come on, tell me.

435
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,560
Don't make me worry.

436
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,080
What's wrong?

437
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,040
Aunty.

438
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,760
I...

439
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,560
Don't scold me when I tell you.

440
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,400
I promise you I won't.

441
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,560
I won't scold you.

442
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,760
I'm lovelorn.

443
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,680
When were you in a relationship?

444
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,000
It has ended before it even began.

445
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,440
He was my...

446
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,640
I admire him.

447
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,560
I realized

448
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
I didn't deserve him at all.

449
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,440
So it was your idol.

450
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,160
Right?

451
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
I thought it was much more serious.

452
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
Young lady, listen to me.

453
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
Don't get carried away.

454
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,960
Live in reality.

455
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,000
It's time to abandon

456
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
your wishful fantasies.

457
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,360
Okay?

458
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,920
Tell me,

459
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,360
what kind of actors do you like?

460
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,640
Andy Lau.

461
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,120
Jiang Xiao Ning.

462
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,440
Come here.

463
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,280
Do you know who Andy Lau is?

464
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,920
Whether it's the distance

465
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,800
or the age,

466
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,480
you two...

467
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,760
There is a gap you can't cross.

468
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,120
Trust me.

469
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
It will never work out.

470
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,880
From now on,

471
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,120
Andy Lau is only...

472
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,640
your uncle!

473
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,720
Yes, Aunty.

474
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,800
Don't call me that.

475
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm Mrs. Lau.

476
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
Mrs. Lau wants to watch TV.

477
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,720
Go get a shower.

478
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,440
Don't bother me.

479
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,520
Yes, Mrs. Lau.

480
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
Rest well.

481
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,440
You too. Don't stay up too late.

482
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
(Remember who you are.)

483
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
(The work comes first.)

484
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,600
(You can't be in love with him anymore.)

485
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,320
(But you can't lose the job.)

486
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,600
(Keep up!)

487
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,480
(She was willing to get close to you)

488
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,680
(and become your friend.)

489
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,600
(You think)

490
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,840
(she is a friend who understands you?)

491
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,320
(She is using you)

492
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,840
(and you haven't realized it yet.)

493
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
(Her qualification and erudition,)

494
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,360
(her social class and the way she talks,)

495
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,640
(even her past with Mr. Gu.)

496
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,400
(You're beneath her in every aspect.)

497
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,080
Good morning, Boss.

498
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,800
What's wrong?

499
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Nothing.

500
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,920
Jiang Xiao Ning.

501
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,680
You seem

502
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,160
a little off lately.

503
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,360
Not at all, Boss.

504
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,480
If you think

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,360
I'm doing anything wrong,

506
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,440
feel free to criticize me.

507
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I can be better.

508
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,960
That's the oddest thing I've heard from you.

509
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,640
Is something bothering you?

510
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm always so carefree.

511
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,480
What could possibly bother me?

512
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,680
Mr. Gu.

513
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,840
This is your schedule

514
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,520
for this week.

515
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,880
The progress chart

516
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
is synced up with the design team.

517
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
I've gathered the slides

518
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,040
and sent them to your email already.

519
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,480
And this is the expense claim.

520
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,240
These are all

521
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,240
Jiang Xiao Ning's jobs.

522
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,360
Why are you in charge now?

523
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,600
She is not feeling well.

524
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,640
So I brought the files here

525
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,760
to have them signed.

526
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,320
She's not feeling well?

527
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,960
By the way,

528
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,160
it's Brother Kai's birthday tonight.

529
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,800
We want to give him a surprise.

530
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
We would appreciate it if you could join us.

531
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,520
Sure.

532
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Invite everyone.

533
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,760
The dinner is on me.

534
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,920
Invite everyone in the office.

535
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,960
Yes!

536
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,920
What did the boss say?

537
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,720
Invite everyone.

538
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,560
No one should be left behind.

539
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,520
He's treating us to dinner.

540
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,080
For real?

541
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,960
I'll make a reservation.

542
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll order a cake.

543
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,160
Okay.

544
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,680
Use my phone number.

545
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,320
I have a membership.

546
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,040
Okay.

547
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,800
Smart.

548
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,660
(HAPPY BIRTHDAY)

549
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,440
How is the wine?

550
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,920
Not bad.

551
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,800
It's a little sweet.

552
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,040
A little sweet.

553
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,120
You've been eating the whole time

554
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,920
without saying a word.

555
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,240
Are you a hungry ghost or what?

556
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,120
No.

557
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,720
The food is fantastic.

558
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,480
You want some wine?

559
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,400
Just drink if you want to.

560
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,280
Mr. Gu.

561
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,960
Xiao Ning wants to have some wine.

562
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,800
You're not going to stop her, right?

563
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,880
That's right, Boss.

564
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,160
Let her have some tonight.

565
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,960
It's a celebration.

566
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,320
I'll call a designated driver for you.

567
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
It's a gathering.

568
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,320
Make an exception.

569
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
Give her a night off.

570
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
Mr. Gu, let her drink a little.

571
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,400
-That's right.
-Come on.

572
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,040
It's just a little.

573
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,680
Just a little.

574
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,320
Just a little.

575
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,040
Everyone is having fun tonight.

576
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,160
All right.

577
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,000
Don't drink too much.

578
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,840
Cheers.

579
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
Cheers.

580
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,560
It's sweet and sour. Tastes good.

581
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
I think that's enough.

582
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,800
Let's play some games.

583
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,400
Prepare the stuff.

584
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,040
Okay.

585
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Come on, the usual rules.

586
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Truth Or Dare.

587
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,560
Sit down.

588
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,440
The bottle is ready.

589
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,200
Okay.

590
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,240
Xiao Ning, must be your first time?

591
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,520
I'll explain the rules to you.

592
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,280
We spin the bottle.

593
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Whoever the bottle points to

594
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,880
must accept the command.

595
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,760
And then

596
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,520
whatever command I draw,

597
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,240
they must accept it.

598
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,880
Xiao Ning.

599
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,360
Let's see what the command is.

600
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,960
Confess your love

601
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,960
to the second person on your right!

602
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,560
One, two,

603
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
Cheng Dong, that's you.

604
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,480
That means you.

605
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,040
Well...

606
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,280
you need to be more specific.

607
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,520
When you're counting the second one,

608
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,920
do you count Xiao Ning as well?

609
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,720
Not to mention

610
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,880
she just got here.

611
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,520
It's you.

612
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,560
You're scaring her.

613
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,080
It's just a game.

614
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,400
You can't break the rules.

615
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
Don't twist the rules.

616
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,760
This doesn't count.

617
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
The rules weren't clear. Again.

618
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,760
No way.

619
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
I think Xiao Ning

620
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,400
is the chosen one.

621
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,880
I'll drink.

622
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,800
She can hold her bottle!

623
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,640
Impressive.

624
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,640
Sister Hong, it's your turn.

625
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay.

626
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,560
Sister Hong.

627
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,200
Your turn.

628
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,400
Xiao Ning.

629
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,120
It's you again.

630
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
You sure are lucky.

631
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
You should buy a lottery ticket.

632
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
I'll draw the card.

633
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,800
It's Truth.

634
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,320
When did you meet your first love?

635
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
When was it?

636
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,840
First love.

637
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,400
I'll drink instead.

638
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,240
Xiao Ning, no.

639
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,520
You can't drink anymore.

640
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,520
You need to answer the question.

641
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,480
Now.

642
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,880
Who is it?

643
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,840
Was it the man who came

644
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,280
to pick you up, driving a fancy car?

645
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,640
It's a man who doesn't like me.

646
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,280
It has ended...

647
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,000
before we even had the chance to start.

648
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,680
It's not

649
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,680
making any sense.

650
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
Is she drunk?

651
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,960
It's Wang Kai's birthday.

652
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Wine is not everything.

653
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,520
Where is the cake?

654
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,320
The cake!

655
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,920
Cake!

656
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,320
The cake!

657
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,680
This is made especially for Brother Kai.

658
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,760
Thank you.

659
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,720
Thank you, Boss.

660
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,680
Thank you, everyone.

661
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,280
Thank you.

662
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,240
I have a crown too?

663
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,320
Thank you so much.

664
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,960
I...

665
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,160
Why there is only one candle

666
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,960
and it has a "three" on it?

667
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,360
Because you're 3 years old!

668
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,600
Boss, look at them.

669
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,080
They are so mean.

670
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,600
Let's sing the birthday song for him.

671
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,080
Birthday song.

672
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,680
Come on.

673
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,680
Happy Birthday to you,

674
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,600
Happy Birthday to you,

675
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,080
Happy Birthday to you...

676
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,680
Happy Birthday to you!

677
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,400
Cut the cake.

678
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,200
Blow out the candle.

679
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,120
Watch out.

680
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Blow out the candle.

681
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,480
I'll make a wish.

682
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,600
Let me make a wish.

683
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,840
Make a wish.

684
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
I wish for world peace.

685
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,000
Great!

686
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,760
Cut the cake.

687
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,200
Let's cut the cake.

688
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
I'll check on her.

689
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,240
Okay.

690
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,120
You can have the slice you cut.

691
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
You're making a mess!

692
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,080
Drank too much?

693
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,920
Are you feeling stressed

694
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
because Mr. Gu's ex-girlfriend

695
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,639
came out of nowhere?

696
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,639
No.

697
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,639
Just take it as I had too much wine.

698
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,520
Stop pushing yourself.

699
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,840
Wen Wen is outstanding

700
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
in every aspect.

701
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,199
Not just you,

702
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,440
even I would

703
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,639
feel the pressure.

704
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
Sister Wen Wen is a great person.

705
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,160
But it has nothing to do with me.

706
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
I don't want you to be like a moth to the flame.

707
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,880
You're facing

708
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,000
such a powerful rival.

709
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,840
Backing out

710
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,160
is not necessarily a bad choice.

711
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,800
Sister Man Lin.

712
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm an adult.

713
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,600
As for what's good

714
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,680
or bad,

715
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,960
I can tell the difference.

716
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,200
Are you saying I'm nosy?

717
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,320
Sister Man Lin.

718
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,840
I got this job at Chuan Studio.

719
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,200
It's all thanks to you.

720
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm grateful to you.

721
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
I'm grateful to Mr. Gu too.

722
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,840
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

723
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
For me,

724
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,200
Mr. Gu is the starry sky.

725
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,040
It's already a miracle for me

726
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,040
by only looking at the starry sky.

727
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Not to mention...

728
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,960
I became so close to it.

729
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
Jiang Xiao Ning.

730
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,960
I know you're going through a rough patch.

731
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,480
I know you came to the company

732
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,200
because you wanted to be a designer.

733
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,360
So...

734
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,600
you should focus

735
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
on your work,

736
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,560
not on Mr. Gu.

737
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,880
Do you understand?

738
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,280
I understand.

739
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,000
However,

740
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm not the only one who likes Mr. Gu.

741
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,920
You like him too.

742
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,760
What are you trying to say?

743
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,120
I mean,

744
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,880
maybe my fantasy

745
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
might lead to a miracle.

746
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm reminding you

747
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,320
for your own good.

748
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,400
I admit

749
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
I got carried away a little.

750
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,680
I should thank you

751
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,160
for your advice.

752
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,400
Fine.

753
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
We should get back.

754
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,760
I need some fresh air.

755
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,680
Sister Man Lin,

756
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,000
you can head back first.

757
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,120
(I thought it through.)

758
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,440
(Sister Man Lin likes Mr. Gu as well.)

759
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,760
(So I can't)

760
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,720
(fall into the trap)

761
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,000
(that is set by my rival.)

762
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,800
(Jiang Xiao Ning.)

763
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,920
(Since you have already created a miracle)

764
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,480
(and approached the sky,)

765
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,360
(you have all the more reason)

766
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,440
(to get close to that shining star.)

767
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,200
(Are you home yet?)

768
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,680
Stop messing around.

769
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
You've been doing it

770
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
the whole night!

771
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,280
What kind of company is this?

772
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,920
How could they

773
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,040
let an employee get this drunk?

774
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,920
It's bad enough that

775
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,040
they never give you a raise.

776
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,840
Give me your hand.

777
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,360
What's wrong with you?

778
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
Don't drink if you can't.

779
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,320
You shouldn't push yourself.

780
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,920
Give me your hand.

781
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,320
Aunty.

782
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,200
Did I hurt you?

783
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,880
Let me rub it for you.

784
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Aunty.

785
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,120
You can't say anything bad about our boss.

786
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,120
He is a decent man.

787
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,920
He is a great man.

788
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,640
It's just that he doesn't like me.

789
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
Are you that drunk?

790
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
You are talking gibberish.

791
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,600
You should be glad

792
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,200
he doesn't like you.

793
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,560
There will be a problem if he likes you.

794
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,360
Aunty.

795
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,680
If he doesn't like me,

796
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,720
he won't give me a raise

797
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,120
and he won't give me a bonus.

798
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,040
I won't get a promotion.

799
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,920
I will be miserable!

800
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,800
Baby!

801
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,680
My holy ancestors!

802
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,200
My sweetheart.

803
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,640
Can we just go to sleep first?

804
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
Leave the raise and promotion aside.

805
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,120
Save it for another time.

806
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,960
Save it for another time.

807
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,840
Come on.

808
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,760
Oh my!

809
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,920
Lean on my arm.

810
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,480
Slowly, gently.

811
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,160
Right here.

812
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,040
Okay.

813
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,560
My back!

814
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,320
My back!

815
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,920
My goodness.

816
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,040
My boss doesn't like me.

817
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,800
Then leave him be.

818
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,040
He won't give me a raise.

819
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,200
I won't get a promotion.

820
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,880
He doesn't like me...

821
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
Boss...

822
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,480
He must like me.

823
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,040
Like me...
