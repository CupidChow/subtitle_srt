Are you Ms. Cheng Yu?

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,280
You are?

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,960
Hello,

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm from Chuan Design Studios.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,680
My name is Jiang Xiao Ning.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,000
I spoke with you on the phone earlier.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Please come in.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,600
What new ideas

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,800
do you guys have?

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
Share them with me.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
Ms. Cheng, the thing is

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
that we have done many drafts.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,160
But no matter how hard we try,

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,520
we couldn't integrate that wall into the design.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
If it doesn't match the overall look,

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
what do you think of tearing it down?

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,640
I've already told you many times.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,280
This is my bottom line.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Is there a special reason for that?

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
I don't need to explain anything to you.

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
If you're asking me,

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
I only have one word for you.

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,400
No.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,800
But it's not exactly feasible

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,360
to leave that wall there.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,640
This is a matter of

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,560
your capabilities.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,560
Ms. Cheng,

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
please have faith in us.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,640
You'll be surprised with what we can do

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
after tearing down that wall.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Ms. Cheng?

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
I don't want to

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,760
say the same thing twice.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,840
Actually, we're in quite a difficult position

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,200
because your husband has already

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
agreed to have that wall demolished.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
If there are any difficulties,

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,640
please let us know.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,320
We'll try our best to solve them for you,

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,880
as long as we can tear down that wall.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,480
What did you say?

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,680
My husband agreed to have that wall torn down?

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes, my colleague told me your husband

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,000
had already agreed to it.

66
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
How could he agree?

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
You're way out of line!

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
You guys couldn't persuade me,

69
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
so you went directly to my husband.

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,680
I really don't understand.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
How could he agree?

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,160
How could he?

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,200
No one knows why I want to keep that wall

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
better than him.

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
He actually agreed?

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
I'm sorry, Ms. Cheng.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
I didn't really know what had happened before.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,240
I guess we were just hoping

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,000
your husband could persuade you.

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,280
That's why we told him.

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
Your company spares no effort

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
to achieve the goal.

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
I'll cancel my order, how about that?

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't need you guys to do the design,

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,680
okay?

86
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm sorry, Ms. Cheng.

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Please listen to me.

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Get out.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Leave now!

90
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,600
Go! Get out.

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,240
Get out!

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,760
Ms...

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,320
I want you to leave.

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,120
Get out.

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,960
-Ms… Ms. Cheng.
-Get out.

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,960
Ms...

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
Ms. Cheng! Ms. Cheng!

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
I just asked you to talk to her.

99
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
What did you do?

100
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,839
What was so bad that the client decided to
cancel her order?

101
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm sorry, Sister Man Lin.

102
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,600
But I really didn't say anything
that crossed the line.

103
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
So many designers had gone

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,800
to speak to her before you.

105
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
And there were just some issues
with the proposals.

106
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
How did you manage to

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
get the order canceled?

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
She's a renowned artist.

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
Our loss will be huge

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
if she cancels her order.

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
I was just telling her

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
what you had told me.

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
But I don't know why

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,320
she suddenly blew up.

115
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
What do you mean?

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,920
Are you trying to shift the blame onto me?

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
No, no, Sister Man Lin.

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
That's not what I meant.

119
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Jiang Xiao Ning,

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
shirking responsibility

121
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,000
is an issue of character.

122
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,840
You misunderstand me, Sister Man Lin.

123
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
How about I go and explain myself?

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
You still want to go?

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll rectify my mistake.

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I'll take responsibility.

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,560
Take responsibility?

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Okay.

129
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
Then resign.

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
You bought so much protein powder.

131
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
How long can you keep having it?

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,520
I think it won't be long.

133
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,840
That's not true.

134
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,760
I always persist

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
through anything, alright?

136
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,480
Back in university, did I complain

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
when I had to keep you company

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
while you rushed to finish assignments and

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I couldn't rest for a whole month?

140
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
Accompanying? You mean

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,380
stay by my side only to

142
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,020
eat fries, play games,

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,400
sing songs, and scroll through your phone ?

144
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Isn't that also accompanying?

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,600
Listen to all those things I did.

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,960
It's true that I didn't get to rest, did I?

147
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
Aren't you going to work out now?

148
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
I want to train

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
my chest, abs, and biceps.

150
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I want Yan Yan to know

151
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
that men with big chest muscles

152
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,400
are equally attractive.

153
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Hello?

154
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,400
I've already told you

155
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
what happened over the phone.

156
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
The most difficult thing to handle right now

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
is the fact that Jiang Xiao Ning and Ms. Cheng Yu

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,560
had an argument.

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Ms. Cheng not only wants to terminate the contract,

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,600
but also even

161
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,480
sue us for breaching the contract.

162
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,760
Ms. Cheng is famous in the art industry.

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,760
Anything she says

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
will have a huge impact on us.

165
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
I didn't argue with Ms. Cheng.

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
You don't need to explain.

167
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,240
How would this be handled

168
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,360
according to the company's rules?

169
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
According to our rules,

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,640
she must leave the company.

171
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Jiang Xiao Ning,

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,480
did you argue with the client?

173
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,520
Yes.

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Did the client expressly tell you

175
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,320
she'd cancel the order?

176
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Yes.

177
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,000
Mr. Gu,

178
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,520
we can't blame everything

179
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,720
on Jiang Xiao Ning.

180
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
She's new here after all...

181
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Other people shouldn't cut in.

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
This kind of matter

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,240
should be decided by Mr. Gu.

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Let's follow the company's rules then.

185
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
You're awake?

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
We're having a meeting yet you're sleeping.

187
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
Don't you know having a meeting

188
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,800
is a serious matter?

189
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,200
You can leave if you don't want to be here.

190
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,840
What do you mean?

191
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,360
You think I'm useless?

192
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm handling the company's affairs.

193
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,440
I can handle it too.

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm the investor.

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm handling the matter

196
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
according to the company's rules.

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Since it's my company,

198
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
I have the right

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,440
to change the company's rules, right?

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,960
You need to keep the balance of the water in the bowl.
(*An idiom for "to treat people fairly")

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm giving you another "bowl",

202
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
so you don't have to bother with the only one.

203
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
Are you determined to talk back?

204
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,360
I just don't like

205
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
that you're being so domineering.

206
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
I'm being responsible to the company.

207
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
This is my company.

208
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,400
Mr. Xu,

209
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,240
Mr. Gu,

210
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
let's talk nicely.

211
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

212
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,280
Fine,

213
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
this is your company, right?

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,080
You can manage it.

216
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,120
I don't care anymore.

217
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,300
(Chuan Design Studios)

218
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
Mr. Xu,

219
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
don't let this small matter

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,400
affect your relationship.

221
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,800
I just can't stand him.

222
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,480
What right does he have to fire someone?

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,360
I refuse.

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,800
You can't be wilful on this.

225
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,400
You know clearly whether I'm wilful

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,360
all these years.

227
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Jiang Xiao Ning,

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,840
I

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
will give you another chance.

230
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Can you resolve

231
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,800
this matter?

232
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
I'll definitely do my best.

233
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Great.

234
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,680
You guys heard that?

235
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
This is the kind of employee I want.

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,520
I want employees

237
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
who are always striving to improve.

238
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
Jiang Xiao Ning,

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,040
I'll give you one week

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
to resolve this matter

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
nicely.

242
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,280
If you pass this deadline,

243
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,680
no one can help you.

244
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
I'll definitely try my best.

245
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,920
Okay.

246
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Meeting's over.

247
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
All the best.

248
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,720
(Did you argue with the client?)

249
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,040
(Yes.)

250
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,280
Did the client expressly tell you

251
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,120
to cancel the order?

252
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,400
Yes.

253
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
Let's follow the company's rules then.

254
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,160
Boss must be so disappointed

255
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
in me today.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
There must be a way

257
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,200
to persuade Ms. Cheng.

258
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm here.

259
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760
You called me to do work,

260
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,240
yet you've drunk yourself to this state.

261
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,640
Why didn't you wait for me?

262
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,120
Look.

263
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,640
I've fixed up the kitchen.

264
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,840
I fixed it up by myself.

265
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,080
I'm good, right?

266
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah, you're great.

267
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
Can you say that again?

268
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,800
What?

269
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Say it again that I'm great.

270
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
You're great.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,840
You're the best.

272
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,000
What happened?

273
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,440
I messed up

274
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,640
and got scolded by my boss.

275
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,160
Which boss?

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
Xu Cheng Ran or the other one?

277
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,840
Come on,

278
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
what's wrong with these people?

279
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
Can't they speak nicely to people

280
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,400
who work hard at their jobs?

281
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,520
Why do they have to scold you?

282
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,400
It's my fault for being useless.

283
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,920
I messed up

284
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
and disappointed Boss.

285
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,360
I didn't want to mess up.

286
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,480
But I'm just not good enough.

287
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,640
Stop drinking.

288
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
It's all my fault.

289
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,680
It has nothing to do with them.

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,120
The client canceled her order.

291
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,880
I should receive my punishment

292
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,680
and leave the company.

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,560
Leave the company?

294
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
Can you bear to leave your boss?

295
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,880
I...

296
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,280
I can't.

297
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,640
When I think about leaving the company

298
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
and never seeing my boss again,

299
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,400
I just...

300
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Okay, okay, okay.

301
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Don't make it sound like it's life or death.

302
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,040
Look at you.

303
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Today...

304
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
today, Mr. Xu

305
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,280
protected me during the meeting.

306
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,240
If not, I would've really had to leave.

307
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
He argued with Boss

308
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,800
during the meeting today.

309
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,280
Boss got angry,

310
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
slammed the door and left.

311
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,880
That exciting?

312
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,760
And then?

313
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,600
What happened in the end?

314
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,400
In the end...

315
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,840
Mr. Xu gave me one week.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
If I can resolve the matter,

317
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
he won't hold it against me.

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Who knew Xu Cheng Ran

319
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,400
could be so manly.

320
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,480
I can't let

321
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,080
Mr. Xu down.

322
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,920
I can't let Boss down.

323
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't leave the company.

324
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,200
Come on.

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I just started getting excited

326
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
and you're being down again.

327
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
I told you Mr. Xu is a good person.

328
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,320
He's different from those normal

329
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
rich second generation.

330
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
Mr. Xu is a good person.

331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
You're a good person.

332
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,200
Boss is even better.

333
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,840
All of you are great.

334
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
You guys are all great.

335
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you, guys.

336
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
Thank you, judges.

337
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,640
Thank you, audience.

338
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,280
It's an honor

339
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
for me to win the

340
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,280
"Best Male Actor" award today.

341
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,520
This is all thanks to my years of efforts

342
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,560
and hard work.

343
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Of course,

344
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,160
more importantly,

345
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,720
it was due to the talent and good looks

346
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
I was born with.

347
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,360
You're too noisy.

348
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
Tell me, was my acting good?

349
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
Was it good?

350
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
Who knew if you were just acting

351
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,800
or if you really

352
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,200
wasn't happy about how I managed the company.

353
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,480
Chuan, you've got no conscience.

354
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,200
The performance at the meeting today

355
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,000
was your idea.

356
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,080
I was just playing along.

357
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,240
You can't wrong me like this.

358
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Yes,

359
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,040
your acting was quite good.

360
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Come, here's a trophy for you.

361
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,800
You can display it at home.

362
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
There are no outsiders now.

363
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's talk.

364
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Be honest with me.

365
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
When you saw Jiang Xiao Ning

366
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
being wronged,

367
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,960
did you feel sorry for her?

368
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
I had never seen

369
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,520
Jiang Xiao Ning like that.

370
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,240
She's normally clowning around

371
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,400
and cheerful.

372
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,360
The moment you left today,

373
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,760
the tears in her eyes kept

374
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,160
rolling, rolling, and rolling.

375
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,960
Do you feel sorry for her?

376
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,520
Why would I?

377
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,360
Do you have special feelings

378
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,920
for Jiang Xiao Ning?

379
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,640
Be honest.

380
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,520
Yes or no.

381
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,200
No.

382
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
It's easy to lie to me

383
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,240
but not to yourself.

384
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,760
Let me put it this way.

385
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Your heart

386
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,400
is like a still lake.

387
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,080
There's no wind, no rain,

388
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
and no turbulence.

389
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,920
Jiang Xiao Ning

390
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,840
isn't like others

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
who are queueing up

392
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,840
waiting to be loved by you

393
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,880
and enter your life.

394
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,880
She's like a meteorite...

395
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,440
that crashed her way in.

396
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,119
The meteorite sinks to the bottom of the lake

397
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,560
and the lake regains its stillness.

398
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,760
To others,

399
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,880
the lake looks the same,

400
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,880
but actually,

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,960
it has been changed forever.

402
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,800
That meteorite is inside of it.

403
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,480
How does that sound?

404
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
I've read some books

405
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
on philosophy these past few days.

406
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,280
Not bad.

407
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,320
The literary sense is not bad.

408
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,320
Your reading didn't go to waste.

409
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,920
In any case, whether or not she's in your heart,

410
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,400
it's not for others to say.

411
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,240
You're the one who needs to acknowledge her

412
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,480
and accept her.

413
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,720
I understand your concerns.

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,640
I know your physical condition,

415
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,200
so I won't give you

416
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,080
any suggestions.

417
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
I just want to say,

418
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
no matter what choice you make,

419
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,440
just don't

420
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,520
regret it.

421
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
I initially planned to

422
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,480
crash at your place tonight.

423
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
But it looks like

424
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,880
you need some space and some time

425
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,800
to reflect on yourself.

426
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,920
Scared?

427
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
A little.

428
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,600
Boss,

429
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,080
I'll protect you.

430
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,360
Boss!

431
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,640
Boss!

432
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
(Wang Kai)

433
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
(Send me Ms. Cheng's address)

434
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
(and contact details.)

435
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,280
Xiao Ning.

436
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,160
It's late. Why aren't you asleep?

437
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Grandma, why are you up?

438
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,800
Your aunt is snoring. I can't sleep.

439
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
Why are you crying?

440
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm not.

441
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
The weather's too hot.

442
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm sweating.

443
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,360
Do you think I'm stupid?

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,040
Come on, tell me

445
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,280
what happened?

446
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
Nothing.

447
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,920
Everything's fine.

448
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,320
Kid,

449
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
you're just as stubborn as your father.

450
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,840
You carry all the burdens on your shoulders.

451
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
That won't do.

452
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,480
If you have any problems,

453
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,240
don't keep them to yourself.

454
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,840
It's bad for your health.

455
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
Tell me,

456
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,520
what happened?

457
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,840
Just something from work.

458
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,760
I...

459
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
made a mistake.

460
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
You're talking nonsense again.

461
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,360
You don't have a job.

462
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,400
Aren't you a student?

463
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
Did you get a question wrong

464
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
and your teacher gave you a low score?

465
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I got a question wrong

466
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,960
which I shouldn't have.

467
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,480
That's nothing.

468
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
Tomorrow,

469
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,560
Grandma will give you some money.

470
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,720
Go buy an eraser to erase the mistake.

471
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
In the future,

472
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
don't make such mistakes again.

473
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Your teacher will like you then.

474
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,080
Okay.

475
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,800
Grandma,

476
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,240
why are your hands so cold?

477
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,720
Did you catch a cold?

478
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,040
Wait for me.

479
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
Here,

480
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
drink this.

481
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
It's warm. You'll feel better after some sleep.

482
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,720
I won't drink it.

483
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,920
I won't.

484
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,400
It's sweet,

485
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,320
not bitter at all.

486
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
Let me blow on it for you.

487
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Come on,

488
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,840
be good.

489
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,920
Xiao Ning,

490
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,160
is your Dad almost back

491
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,840
from his business trip?

492
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,840
I should go to sleep.

493
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,080
I still need to

494
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,320
go to the bus terminal to pick him up tomorrow.

495
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,080
You should go to sleep early too.

496
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
My granddaughter is so pretty.

497
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,960
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too.

498
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,120
Go rest.

499
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,520
What's up?

500
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,720
Hello?

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm in trouble.

502
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
You have to help me.

503
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,800
You want money, right?

504
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm a little tight on cash recently.

505
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,160
You can't just leave me in the lurch.

506
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,640
I just gave you some.

507
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
Besides, I told you that the previous time

508
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,120
would be the last time.

509
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,440
You insist on getting things nasty, huh?

510
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Whatever.

511
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm telling you,

512
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,600
don't mess with me.

513
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,960
When I'm desperate,

514
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Xu Guo Xiang is

515
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,920
going to hear from me.

516
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,920
Hello?

517
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,280
Hello?

518
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Ms. Cheng,

519
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm here to apologize.

520
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,760
I've already canceled the order.

521
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,640
You don't need to come.

522
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,800
But... but... but...

523
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,520
Ms. Cheng,

524
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,520
I truly want to apologize to you.

525
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,960
I made you so angry last time.

526
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,080
It must be something I said

527
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,480
that upset you.

528
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,360
I'm sorry.

529
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm not angry.

530
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,760
Please leave

531
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
and don't come here again.

532
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,520
Ms. Cheng!

533
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,600
Ms. Cheng!

534
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,800
Your way of resolving matters

535
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,280
is to apologize only?

536
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't know what else I can do.

537
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,080
You normally have

538
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
quite a lot of creative ideas, don't you?

539
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,920
It's my first time

540
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,640
encountering such a problem.

541
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,840
I don't know what to do.

542
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,640
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,640
You must be very disappointed in me.

544
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,000
I...

545
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,600
never had much hope for you in the first place.

546
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,320
So I'm not disappointed.

547
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,960
I happened to pass by here

548
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,400
and saw you carrying all that stuff,

549
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,920
so I came to see

550
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,360
what exactly you intended to do.

551
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,480
Remember my words.

552
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,600
Just apologizing

553
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,160
won't solve anything.

554
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,880
Go back and think about it.

555
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,720
Designers need to persuade people
with their designs,

556
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,120
not these things.

557
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,640
I'm sorry.

558
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
I won't let you down.

559
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,440
(Was I too harsh?)

560
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
(Will she be able to take it?)

561
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,600
I thought Mr. Gu

562
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
would come to her rescue yesterday.

563
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
He was so nice to Jiang Xiao Ning normally,

564
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
yet when it came down to it,

565
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
he did nothing.

566
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
It seemed like she won the lottery,

567
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,800
but it ended up being nothing at all.

568
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440
Jiang Xiao Ning is really unlucky.

569
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,520
I heard this project

570
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
is exceptionally difficult to handle.

571
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
It's normal that a newcomer like her

572
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,400
fail to make it.

573
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
But I was quite surprised by

574
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
Mr. Xu's actions yesterday.

575
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
Is it that his taste has changed?

576
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,720
Nothing is impossible.

577
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
If you put it that way...

578
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,400
Does it mean there's hope for me too?

579
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,120
There's no hope for you.

580
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Didn't you say

581
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,000
nothing is impossible?

582
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,360
That doesn't apply to you.

583
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,800
You already belong to someone.

584
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,680
How come I don't know that?

585
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,280
Look over here, here.

586
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,000
If you can't see clearly, come closer.

587
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,360
There you go again.

588
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,000
It's no use coming any closer.

589
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,520
If I could see it, I would've done it already.

590
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,160
You don't have to

591
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,080
be so snobby.

592
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,120
At the very least,

593
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,320
I'm the Administrative Deputy Director
of this company.

594
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,440
You're all Directors,

595
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,080
but why is the disparity so huge?

596
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,920
Can't we have someone more handsome?

597
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,680
Am I not handsome?

598
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,480
Am… Am I not handsome?

599
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:04,880
Morning!

600
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,880
Morning.

601
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,960
Everyone, have some Meco.

602
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,040
Thank you, Xiao Ning.

603
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,440
Why are you so happy all of a sudden?

604
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,120
What happened yesterday...

605
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,080
Jia Jia,

606
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,880
Cherry Berry, your favorite.

607
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll open it for you.

608
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,000
Okay, okay, okay.

609
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,960
As to what happened yesterday,

610
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,480
there are still a lot of things

611
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
I need to learn from everyone.

612
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,640
No problem.

613
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,320
We will guide you patiently.

614
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
I won't be shy then.

615
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,360
You should drink too.

616
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,120
I…

617
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,440
Sister Man Lin...

618
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
I want yours.

619
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,720
Your favorite, Berry and Grapefruit.

620
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,200
Thank you.

621
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,440
Jiang Xiao Ning,

622
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I wasn't picking on you yesterday.

623
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,560
After all...

624
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,160
I understand.

625
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,440
I don't blame you at all.

626
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,880
It was my fault for not handling it well.

627
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,440
Since Mr. Xu is willing to give you a chance,

628
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
then try your best.

629
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,240
If you need my help, let me know.

630
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,080
Thank you, Sister Man Lin.

631
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,280
I will ask you if I need any help.

632
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,800
Hurry, look at this.

633
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,560
What a big bouquet of flowers.

634
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,920
Look at that!

635
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,180
(The Scientist Café)

636
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
He's so handsome.

637
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,560
If my boyfriend was this handsome

638
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,840
and bought me such a big bouquet,

639
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,160
I'd be so happy.

640
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
What are you doing?

641
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,720
Yan Yan.

642
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,640
Do you like it?

643
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
It's a little heavy,

644
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,120
but I can help you carry it.

645
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Hurry, leave.

646
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,160
Don't embarrass me here.

647
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
If you don't like it,

648
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,960
I'll have to kneel before you.

649
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,760
You'll regret it if you do.

650
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't camp out here before and

651
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,920
after work.

652
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
I'll be even more annoyed if you do this.

653
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,160
I really do have a reason for coming today.

654
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,560
Jiang Xiao Ning's notebook.

655
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,840
Help me give it back to her.

656
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,600
You can give it to her boss,

657
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
your good friend.

658
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,440
Isn't that more appropriate?

659
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,560
If I do that,

660
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,640
I'll miss a chance to see you.

661
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,440
Careful!

662
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,120
Are you okay?

663
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,160
Not bad, Xu Cheng Ran.

664
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,920
You even hire side actors now.

665
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,080
Remember to get a side camera next time

666
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,280
to record it.

667
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,120
No coffee?

668
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,320
Love you!

669
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,920
Let's go take a photo.

670
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,920
Okay.

671
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,760
-Hello.
-Hello.

672
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,760
Could we take a picture?

673
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
Sure.

674
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,640
Could you move a little to the side?

675
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll give it to you.

676
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,160
Thank you.

677
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,920
Thank you.

678
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
(Notice: Area under construction)
(Do not enter)

679
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,920
Boss.

680
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,760
Why are you here?

681
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,720
You asked me to come up with a solution.

682
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,840
I came here to take a look.

683
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,560
You...

684
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,840
This is the company's project.

685
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,440
Of course I need to get involved.

686
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,280
Have you come up with a solution?

687
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
I had a chat with the company's designer

688
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,080
and have found a breakthrough.

689
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,400
So, I was thinking of

690
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
having a chat with Ms. Cheng's husband.

691
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Why?

692
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,360
I had a chat with Qiao Meng Jia as well.

693
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,680
She told me that last time, she spoke to her husband,

694
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,160
he actually agreed to have the wall torn down

695
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,400
and said that this was for Ms. Cheng's own good.

696
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,880
But this was denied by Ms. Cheng.

697
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
I believe that there must be a story

698
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
behind this wall.

699
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
It's just that this couple

700
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
is unwilling to bring it up.

701
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,880
Do you think looking for him

702
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
would solve the problem?

703
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm not sure,

704
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,400
but at least

705
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
it's a way forward.

706
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
So that's why I need to take a good look

707
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,720
at this wall

708
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,000
to find a breakthrough

709
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,080
and convince Ms. Cheng.

710
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,520
Try your best then.

711
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,800
Boss,

712
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,520
where's your car?

713
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,040
I took a taxi.

714
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,480
Taxi?

715
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,040
Let me call a taxi for you then.

716
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,720
Do you get a signal on your phone?

717
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,920
There's no signal.

718
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Oh, no.

719
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,960
How do we call a taxi now?

720
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,840
How did you come?

721
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,760
I rode this here.

722
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
Slow down.

723
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,640
Boss,

724
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,520
don't worry.

725
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm a steady rider.

726
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,560
If your seat isn't stable,

727
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,560
you can hold onto me.

728
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
Do you hate me

729
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,280
for agreeing to fire you?

730
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,360
What did you say?

731
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
I said

732
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,840
"Do you hate me?"

733
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,840
That scared me.

734
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,160
Boss,

735
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
what did you say just now?

736
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,760
Boss?

737
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,840
Boss!

738
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,880
Boss!

739
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,160
I said,

740
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,080
"Do you hate me?"

741
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,200
That scared me.

742
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,840
Boss, what did you say?

743
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840
Boss!

744
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Boss.

745
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,800
Boss.

746
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,480
Boss.

747
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Boss.

748
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,360
Are you okay, Boss?

749
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,640
Boss,

750
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,080
are you okay?

751
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Boss,

752
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,520
I didn't do it on purpose.

753
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,360
Are you okay?

754
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
That was considered murder.

755
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,760
I didn't.

756
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,560
I was talking to you

757
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
and didn't see the bump.

758
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,360
I didn't hear what you were saying.

759
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,920
What were you saying?

760
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,520
I asked you

761
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
whether you hate me.

762
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,880
No, not at all.

763
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,400
Who would believe you?

764
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,160
You were taking revenge just now.

765
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,120
Boss, I'm not lying to you.

766
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
And I don't hate you at all.

767
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,400
Really?

768
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,120
Really.

769
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,000
You were obviously taking revenge.

770
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,480
I… I'm not lying to you.

771
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,880
Boss, get on the bike.

772
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,120
We still got a long way to go.

773
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,040
Get on the bike?

774
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,160
And fall again?

775
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,000
But isn't it tiring

776
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,920
for you to walk down?

777
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,640
I'd love to.

778
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
Then I'll walk with you.

779
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,600
Miss Jiang,

780
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,320
here you go.

781
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Thank you.

782
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,560
Actually,

783
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,040
Mr. Gu had already spoken to me

784
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,120
immediately after the incident.

785
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,600
I understand your difficulty.

786
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,160
After all, there is a split

787
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,080
between me and my wife.

788
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,560
Mr. Mu,

789
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,280
I'd like to know

790
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,920
why Ms. Cheng

791
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
is so insistent on keeping that wall

792
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
while you agree to tear it down.

793
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Is there a story behind this?

794
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,440
Actually, there's nothing

795
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,360
that can't be said.

796
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,240
I remember when that place

797
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,760
wasn't an art district yet,

798
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,760
my wife often brought my son there

799
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
to play.

800
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,840
That wall has

801
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,080
a lot of fond memories on it.

802
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,960
However,

803
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,199
my son died from drowning

804
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,920
when he was five.

805
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,360
All these years,

806
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,920
my wife has always been in pain

807
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,880
and still can't come out of the pain.

808
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
So,

809
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,040
Ms. Cheng built the art gallery

810
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,760
to commemorate your son.

811
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,040
Mr. Gu.

812
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,199
Come in.

813
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,360
This is an order we just finished.

814
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,400
Please sign here.

815
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,920
Sure.

816
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,239
Mr. Xu and you are fine now?

817
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,639
We're fine.

818
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,880
So actually,

819
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,240
you guys planned this.

820
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,360
Yes.

821
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
You guys could put on a show

822
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,840
in front of the employees,

823
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
but why hid it from me?

824
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,080
You would have guessed it anyway

825
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
even if we didn't tell you such trivial stuff.

826
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,160
But you guys doing this makes me feel like

827
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm an outsider.

828
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,400
You think too much.

829
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Your attitude towards Jiang Xiao Ning
is very different.

830
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,000
Is it?

831
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,800
You allow her to go to your house.

832
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,040
You gave her a hairpin.

833
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,760
I've been by your side for six years.

834
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,600
I've never seen you

835
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,640
treat an employee like this.

836
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,120
This isn't your usual style.

837
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,200
Throwing such a difficult project

838
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,480
to someone

839
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,680
who isn't even a qualified

840
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,040
architectural assistant to handle

841
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
isn't your

842
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,680
usual style either.

843
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,680
That's because she's hardworking

844
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,880
and has potential.

845
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,240
I wanted to give her a chance.

846
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,080
I didn't let her leave also because

847
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
I wanted to give her another chance.

848
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,040
Maybe I was too strict

849
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,000
with her.

850
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,280
It's good to be strict with the company's business.

851
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,880
But if the situation is special...

852
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
Is the situation special

853
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,760
or the person?

854
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,320
Su Man Lin,

855
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,760
you don't need to interfere

856
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,360
with my personal affairs.

857
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
I know clearly about my own affairs.

858
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm sorry.

859
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,080
I'll leave you to your work.

860
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,080
I understand.

861
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,800
I can also understand why Ms. Cheng

862
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,160
wants to keep that wall.

863
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,480
Actually,

864
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,960
letting go

865
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,400
isn't achieved by

866
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,320
not looking,

867
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,320
not listening,

868
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
and not thinking.

869
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,960
Ten years ago,

870
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,720
my parents passed away

871
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,360
in a car accident.

872
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,920
I was also in the car at that time.

873
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,600
From that moment on,

874
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,120
nightmares of the accident

875
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,640
have always haunted me.

876
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,040
I even tried to

877
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,160
hide all of my parents' things.

878
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,760
I thought I could forget

879
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,520
if I didn't see them.

880
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,880
But strangely,

881
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
the more you want to forget,

882
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
the more clearly you'll remember.

883
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,360
Eventually,

884
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,240
my grandma and aunt

885
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
took out

886
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,440
all of their items,

887
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,600
which was just like

888
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,640
they had never left us.

889
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,000
Every Spring Festival,

890
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
we leave a set of cutlery for them.

891
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,080
My grandma also tells me

892
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
funny stories about my parents from the past.

893
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,640
Heartwarming stories also.

894
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm getting more used to accepting

895
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,160
the fact that they are gone.

896
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,720
That day, when I went to look at the wall,

897
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,080
there were many lines drawn with crayons

898
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,840
on the wall.

899
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,880
Just like a rainbow.

900
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,480
And cute little footprints

901
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,720
and fingerprints.

902
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,840
Those must have been left behind

903
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,880
by your child, right?

904
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,400
Maybe Ms. Cheng is doing this

905
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,000
to try to save herself.

906
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,520
Once the art gallery is constructed,

907
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,920
that place must be the place

908
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,240
she'll visit the most often.

909
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,760
Every time she goes there,

910
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,520
she can reminisce

911
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,320
every single moment

912
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,240
she had with her child.

913
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Isn't that a form of healing as well?

914
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,160
At least,

915
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
no matter it's my parents

916
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,520
or your child,

917
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,880
they have been in this world once

918
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
and they left behind beautiful memories.

919
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,080
They should be remembered by us.

920
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,880
If we don't even dare

921
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,960
to keep memories,

922
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,280
or to touch them,

923
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,760
that would be the most regretful thing.

924
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
I was too brash previously.

925
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,840
I sincerely apologize

926
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,960
to you and Ms. Cheng.

927
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,480
Whether we will get to

928
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,240
design the wall in the end,

929
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
I earnestly request you

930
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,880
to keep that wall which is filled with memories

931
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,080
because it deserves to be there.
