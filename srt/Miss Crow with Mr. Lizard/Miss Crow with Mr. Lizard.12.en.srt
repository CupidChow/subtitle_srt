Boss.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
What's wrong?

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Did I say something wrong?

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,320
You didn't.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,840
Where are we going now?

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,639
You'll know once we get there.

Ski resort?

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Boss.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,320
Why is there a ski resort?

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,120
This place

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
was designed by the studio.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,440
We happened to be nearby.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
So I bring you here

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
to have a study tour.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,840
Thank you, Boss.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Mr. Gu, long time no see.

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
It's been a while.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
Are you here today for skiing?

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Please let me know if you need any help.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm always ready to assist you.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
No, thanks.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm just here to show my assistant around.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,080
All right.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,720
Let me get you

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,640
two jackets.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
It's chilly inside.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,720
Okay.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,760
Thank you.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,600
Thank you.

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,480

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,280
need any help later,

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,520
feel free to let me know.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,280
Thank you.

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll get back to work.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
It's so beautiful!

58

Boss.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,440
It's magnificent.

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,720
Boss.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,440
Please help me take some photos.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,640
Just a few will do, Boss.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,920
Boss.

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,520
Do I

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,400
look like Cinderella

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,360
who's going to the castle for the ball?

67
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
Please make me look taller.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Lower the phone a bit.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,720
And don't shoot

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
those words.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Have you struck a pose?

72
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,480
Yes, I'm ready.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,060
Do I look good?

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,420
Yes, you do.

♪Those blazing dreams, follow my command♪

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,780
Done.

77
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,980
Take some more, Boss.

78
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,340
I took you here to have a study tour,

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,460
not to have fun.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
Let's go.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
Boss.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Wait for me, Boss.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,040
Boss.

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know conservation of luck?

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
I don't know.

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,880
It means

87
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
if you've always been lucky,

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
bad luck will approach you not long after.

89
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,720
On the other hand,

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
if you've always been unlucky,

91
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,880
something good is going to happen.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
Which phase are you in now?

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,160
After I met you,

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,000
a long streak of

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
bad luck I've been having

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
has finally turned into good luck.

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
Do I have such great capacity?

98
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,360
Of course, you do.

99
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
You provided me

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
such a good job.

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,640
You even gave me a chance to learn.

102
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,040
It seems that I started to

103
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,480
have good luck

104
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,960
after I met you.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,960
Should I take it as

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,360
you're actually

107
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,040
flattering me now?

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm expressing my gratitude sincerely.

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,600
We gain success and luck

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,760
through hard work.

111
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
You don't have to give me all the credit.

112
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Actually, you have a strong comprehension

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
of design.

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
And you're very talented.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,440
It's just

116
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,200
you lacked chances and learning.

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Boss.

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry.

119
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,960
I'll redouble my efforts.

120
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Thank you, Boss.

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's go.

122
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,960
Let's get to the front and check it out.

123
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,280
Okay.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Awesome.

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,920
Boss.

126
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't know how to ski.

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,280
But I really admire

128
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
those who can ski.

129
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Do you know how to ski?

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,960
I used to ski in Switzerland.

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Really?

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,800
Isn't it exciting?

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
It must feel like you're traveling through

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
snowy mountains and woods.

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,080
As if you're flying.

136
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,960
I haven't skied for a long time.

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
I forget how it felt like.

138
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,400
I see.

139
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,800
Since you

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
haven't been skiing for so long,

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,000
do you want to

142
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
relive the past experience?

143
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Boss.

144
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,720
It's fine.

145
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm not interested in it anymore.

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
What a pity.

147
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,960
I don't get to see Boss's

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,280
graceful skiing posture.

149
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Look at these.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,960
Here looks even more beautiful.

151
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,320
Boss.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
Over here.

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Boss, say cheese.

154
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
Over here.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,240
Give it to me.

156
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,560
Let me take photos for you.

157
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
Thank you, Boss.

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
Wait for a second, Boss.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,080
Boss.

160
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,800
Please make me look like

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm actually skiing.

162
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
Come on.

163
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm ready.

164
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,800
One, two, three.

165
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,360
Boss.

166
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Do I look like I'm skiing?

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,480
Yes.

168
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,200
Do I?

169
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Hold on.

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
Shoot the backdrop

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,880
as well.

172
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
As I throw the snow up,

173
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
press the shutter.

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,520
I'll count to three.

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,040
Here we go. One, two, three.

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,280
Just give it to me.

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,240
Thank you.

195
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,760
Boss.

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Are you really okay?

197
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm okay.

198
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,840
I felt as if

199
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,720
I got an electric shock.

200
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
My body felt a bit numb.

201
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Did you feel that?

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
I didn't.

203
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,160
Maybe you fell down.

204
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,200
I guess so.

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,280
Mr. Gu.

206
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Could you

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,840
please fill out

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
this questionnaire?

209
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,920
If you have any comments

210
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
or suggestions,

211
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,440
please let us know

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,600
so that we can improve.

213
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

214
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,592
(What's the relationship between
you and your companion?)

215
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
(Friends)

216
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,880
Done.

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
Thank you.

218
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

219
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
Since Mr. Gu rarely comes here,

220
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,280
we are

221
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
giving away dolls.

222
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,160
You can pick some

223
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,640
you like over there.

224
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,560
No, thanks.

225
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
Yes, yes, yes.

226
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,320
You don't always have free gifts.

227
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,320
How could you not get one?

228
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,240
Thanks.

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
My pleasure.

230
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Thank you.

231
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
There're so many dolls.

232
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Boss.

233
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,360
Have you ever played a claw machine?

234
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,840
You're always busy.

235
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
You must have never played it before.

236
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,600
I played it before.

237
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
But due to my bad luck,

238
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
my favorite doll

239
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
had always been

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,200
caught by others.

241
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
Today,

242
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,320
I want to make it up for myself.

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,080
Boss.

244
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,480
Doesn't it look like you?

245
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
Does it look like me?

246
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,120
Yes.

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Angry crow.

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Do you think it looks like you?

249
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Why would I look like a crow?

250
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,680
I think you do.

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Let's go back.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
(How could he give me a crow?)

253
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,400
(That's too much.)

254
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
Boss.

255
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,280
Are you really not

256
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,600
going to sing karaoke later on?

257
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,160
If I don't attend,

258
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
all of you can have a better time.

259
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
Not necessarily.

260
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,520
Think about it again.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
What is this used for?

262
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
What is this used for?

263
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,560
(Wow, it can record sounds.)

264
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
Boss, Boss.

265
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Don't always pull a long face.

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,040
What are you laughing at?

267
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Nothing.

268
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,320
Boss, I'll give this to you.

269
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,800
You're back.

270
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,800
Sister Man Lin.

271
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,520
Are you going to the karaoke party?

272
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,640
Mr. Gu is not going, right?

273
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,080
I'll go.

274
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,400
Great!

275
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Let me put this doll in the room first.

276
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,720
Sister Man Lin, give me a minute.

277
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
I'll put it in the room as well.

278
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Why didn't I record it

279
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,240
while Boss was talking?

280
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,160
Why did I record my own voice?

281
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,600
Jiang Xiao Ning, you fool!

282
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,160
Fool. Fool.

283
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Fool. Fool.

284
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,600
It can record sounds too?

285
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,720
Jiang Xiao Ning.

286
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,000
You either work hard

287
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,560
or just leave.

288
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,880
Jiang Xiao Ning.

289
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,000
You either work hard

290
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,280
or just leave.

291
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,760
Boss, Boss.

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
Don't always pull a long face.

293
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Boss, Boss.

294
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,560
Don't always pull a long face.

295
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

296
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
May all your wishes

297
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
come true.

298
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,900
♪One, two, three, count with me♪

299

Boss, you're here.

303
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,880
Mr. Gu.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Mr. Gu.

305
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm sorry, Boss.

306
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
We started first.

307
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
It's fine. Just have fun.

308
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,000
Move over, move over.

309
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,200
Sit over, quick.

310
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,360
Just go on.

311
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
Why do you sit there?

312
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Jia Jia, Jia Jia.

313
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,120
Come on, come on.

314
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,840
Here, here.

315
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,920
Sit down quickly.

316
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,400
Well.

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Boss, sing a song!

318
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
Boss, sing a song!

319
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Boss, sing a song!

320
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Boss, sing a song!

321
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,480
Boss, sing a song!

322
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,160
Boss, sing a song!

323
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
Boss, sing a song!

324
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
All right, stop.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Mr. Gu doesn't want to sing.

326
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,040
Don't force him then.

327
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,120
Jiang Xiao Ning.

328
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,280
It's your first time

329
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,160
singing karaoke with us, right?

330
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,840
How about you sing a song first?

331
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah, Xiao Ning.

332
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,520
Sing a song first

333
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,720
before everyone.

334
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,640
We...

335
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,080
haven't heard you singing before.

336
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,240
Brother Kai, I can't sing well.

337
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
If you don't sing, it'll be awkward.

338
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Never mind, I'll pick a song for you.

339
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,760
All right, then!

340
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,520
I'll sing a song to all.

341
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
But I'll get a bit out of tune.

342
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,840
That's right.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
Everyone will get out of tune when singing.

344
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,080
Right?

345
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,240
We're not professional singers.

346
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll sing this song.

347
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,160
This song is okay.

348
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,920
All right.

349
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
I can't help but

350
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,520
feel a little happy.

351
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,080
I can't help but feel a little...

352
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,320
Why did she force herself?

353
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
She could have just said she can't sing.

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,480
Now it's really awkward.

355
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,880
She did say just now.

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
But no one cared about that.

357
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,440
I can't help but

358
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,040
feel a little happy.

359
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,880
I can't help but

360
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,520
feel a little nervous.

361
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,920
Boss's holding the microphone.

362
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,480
You...

363
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,160
Is it the so-called

364
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,520
"hero saves a beauty"?

365
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,720
Record it, quick.

366
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,240
-So charming.
-Quick!

367
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
-Quick.
-Come on!

368
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,440
The red apple on the tree

369
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
fell off and hit me.

370
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Newton's laws of motion...

371
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,640
Well.

372
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,240
I should stop recording.

373
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,760
Is this how the song

374
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
was originally sung?

375
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,040
I guess this is the original version.

376
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,600
Now I know what it meant by

377
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,080
no matter how good you are there's
always someone better.

378
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,160
Based on the data,

379
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
there are not many people who'll get out of tune.

380
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,520
I didn't expect

381
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,880
there're two of them in our company.

382
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:57,960
Bah!

383
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,760
What are you saying?

384
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,640
Mr. Gu finally

385
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,720
fitted into us.

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
We have to pull ourselves together.

387
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,040
Pull ourselves together.

388
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Right?

389
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,520
We have to get high-spirited.

390
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,960
Right.

391
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,599
Come on.

392
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,400
Nice.

393
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,520

It's here.

As for personnel aspects...

477
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,320

478
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080

482
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,760
Boss just smiled at me.

483
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
It's frightening.

484
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,200
It's been two years since I worked here.

485
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,160
Boss smiled at me for the first time ever.

486
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,000
It sent chills down my spine.

487
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,760

488
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,560
No.

489
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,520
I mean

490
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Boss has changed a lot recently.

491
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,680
Did you see

492
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,480
what Jiang Xiao Ning post

493
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,200
on Moments yesterday?

494
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,920
No.

495
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
Did she go skiing with Boss?

496
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,200
My goodness.

497
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,240
I've been working here for many years.

498
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
Mr. Gu had never talked to me personally

499
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,680
except

500
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
when he scolded me.

501
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
But she went skiing with Mr. Gu.

502
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm jealous.

503
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,520
She must be getting a raise soon.

504
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,640
I've told you there's no chance for you.

505
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,880
Stop talking nonsense.

506
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,360
Just telling the truth.

507
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
I'm late.

508
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,160
All right, let's get back.

509
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,960
Mr. Gu, what's the matter?

510
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
Where's Jiang Xiao Ning?

511
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,560
She went out.

512
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,200
Went out?

513
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,640
Where did she go?

514
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,280
She went for a meal with someone.

515
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,960
With her childhood sweetheart.

516
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
Childhood sweetheart?

517
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,800
The one we met in the hospital

518
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,720
last time.

519
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,680
I was afraid she'd be late.

520
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,280
I even asked her

521
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
to leave earlier.

522
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,640
Mr. Gu, is there anything you need?

523
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,360
I can help you.

524
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,920
No, thanks.

525
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,560
It's just lunch.

526
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,920
Don't you think it's too grand?

527
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,600
Don't care much about it.

528
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,360
Just order.

529
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,640
Oh right, Xiao Ning.

530
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
How was the team-building event?

531
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
It was fun. I had a good time.

532
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,000
It's great then.

533
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,760
You

534
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
do need to unwind.

535
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
My boss

536
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,720
is such a good boss.

537
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,480
He taught me how to design

538
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
and also enlightened me.

539
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,800
When I'm with him,

540
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,520
I'll feel like I'm growing up

541
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,520
and learning.

542
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,160
And I'm so lucky

543
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,440
to join this company.

544
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
He's very talented as well.

545
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,840
Speaking of which,

546
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
I do have a project

547
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,800
that I

548
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,720
want to cooperate

549
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,360
with your studio.

550
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
I also admire Gu Chuan's talent

551
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,040
a lot.

552
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,720
If we work together

553
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,760
on it,

554
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
does it mean that

555
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,120
I can see you, a busy bee, every day?

556
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
Well, I don't know.

557
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,200
I didn't take part in the early stage.

558
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,680
I didn't accept the order.

559
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm not the designer.

560
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm just learning.

561
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,800
If you want to cooperate

562
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,600
with our company,

563
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,800
you can go and ask.

564
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,360
Through cooperation,

565
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
the relation between you and Mr. Xu

566
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,800
may be thawing.

567
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,200
All right.

568
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Let's eat first.

569
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,840
I'll starve to death

570
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,120
waiting for you to order.

571
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,080
Waiter.

572
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,160
That's all.

573
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,960
(Next time when you go out,)

574
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,440
(you have to ask me for leave)

575
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
(and get my permission.)

576
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,720
What's the matter?

577
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,440
I shouldn't have praised him.

578
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,880
Your boss?

579
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,160
I didn't inform him before leaving.

580
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,480
I thought it'd be fine.

581
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,480
Every boss

582
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,640
picks on their assistants.

583
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Take it easy.

584
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,840
It's my problem. I was careless.

585
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,280
If he's

586
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,840
as good as

587
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,760
you said,

588
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,080
he won't make such a thing

589
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,800
difficult for you.

590
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
He didn't.

591
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,080
He said if I go out again,

592
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,960
I need to

593
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,480
get his permission first to leave.

594
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,400
Oh, no.

595
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,520
I've got to go.

596
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,760
He hasn't eaten yet for sure.

597
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,400
He hasn't eaten.

598
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
Why would you be so nervous?

599
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,560
You haven't eaten yet too.

600
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,400
I'll be leaving, Brother Xu.

601
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,280
Let's eat together next time.

602
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,960
Enjoy your meal.

603
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,200
-Goodbye, Goodbye.
-Xiao Ning.

604
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
Did he really get mad?

605
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,000
Jia Jia.

606
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
Have you seen Boss?

607
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
He has left for a while.

608
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
Maybe he went for a meal.

609
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Didn't he tell you?

610
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,800
All right, thank you.

611
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,480
Coming.

612
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,440
Why are you here?

613
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
Ouch, it hurts.

614
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,440
Let go of it.

615
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,360
A fortune teller told me that I have to stay with

616
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
someone who's Virgo for at least

617
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,720
eight hours today.

618
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,080
That's why I'm here.

619
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
A fortune teller

620
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
said you need to stay with someone who's Virgo

621
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,680
for at least eight hours?

622
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,400
Yan Yan, why are you so serious?

623
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,600
I'm just saying.

624
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,480
You!

625
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,680
Get out of here.

626
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,560
Get out?
(*Has the same meaning as "roll")

627
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,040
Okay.

628
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,000
Xu Cheng Ran, let me tell you.

629
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,000
I should have recorded this

630
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,200
and let everyone in the world see

631
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,920
how foolish you are.

632
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,320
No need.

633
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,880
Roll again.

634
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Dear fans,

635
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,640
hello all.

636
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,200
Today, let me tell you how it feels

637
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,640
to sleep on the sofa

638
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
at your girlfriend's place.

639
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,400
This is my girlfriend's house.

640
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,120
This is my girlfriend.

641
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,840
Are you insane?

642
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,760
Get out of here quickly.

643
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,920
There's someone coming over later.

644
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,560
Who's coming over at this late night?

645
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,240
It's none of your business.

646
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
I'll ask just one question.

647
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Is it a man

648
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,440
or a man?

649
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,640
Jiang Xiao Ning.

650
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,160
Do you think she's a man or a man?

651
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
Oh, Jiang Xiao Ning.

652
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,320
Why is she coming?

653
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm telling her not to come.

654
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
Because the epiphyllum I've been longing for

655
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
is finally going to bloom today.

656
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
It vanishes as soon as it blooms.
(*Something wonderful won't last long)

657
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,320
It's such a romantic matter.

658
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,720
How could you exclude me?

659
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
Besides,

660
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,520
you'll need professional photography equipment.

661
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,680
I have it.

662
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,040
Hello?

663
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,160
Chuan, do you want to see blooming flowers?

664
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,080
At this late night?

665
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,320
Are you drunk?

666
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,360
I didn't drink anything.

667
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
I'm serious.

668
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,480
We haven't seen blooming flowers

669
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,560
at night ever, have we?

670
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
If I become rich...

671
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,840
No.

672
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,680
If I become as rich as you're,

673
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,480
I will definitely take you

674
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,280
to the best brain surgeon.

675
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm hanging up.

676
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Don't hang up yet.

677
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Listen.

678
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
It's not the other types of flowers.

679
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
It's epiphyllum.

680
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,680
You've never seen it, right?

681
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,720
So do I.

682
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,680
It vanishes as soon as it blooms.

683
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,400
Aren't you curious about it?

684
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I'm not interested in it. Bye.

685
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,240
Let me finish.

686
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm at Yan Yan's place.

687
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,800
Jiang Xiao Ning will come over later.

688
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,320
She's such a third wheel.

689
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
Come here quickly and take her away.

690
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,080
I need quality time with Yan Yan. Do you get it?

691
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,600
Since you're

692
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,600
begging me sincerely,

693
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
I'll reluctantly agree then.

694
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,040
I'll check it out.

695
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,840
I know you love me.

696
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,680
Bring your camera

697
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
here quickly.

698
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,240
Be quick.

699
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,520
The epiphyllums are not waiting for us.

700
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,360
But my happiness is waiting for you.

701
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,880
Coming.

702
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
I asked you to bring me some
professional equipment.

703
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,360
Why are you

704
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,200
just here?

705
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,880
All the flowers are going to bloom.

706
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,440
Boss?

707
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
Why are you here?

708
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
He forced me to come.

709
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,760
Yes.

710
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,240
I threatened him with a knife

711
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,040
on his neck to force him.

712
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
Why are you still standing there?

713
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,920
Come in and help me bring out the drinks quickly.

714
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm going to get the drinks.

715
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Boss, please come in.

716
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,040
Boss.

717
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,040
Are you still mad at

718
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,120
what I did during the day?

719
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,800
I promise I won't do it again.

720
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
I'll tell you right away

721
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,200
if there is anything.

722
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,560
Okay.

723
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,840
You're

724
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,400
the most generous boss ever.

725
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
It's a bit too much.

726
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
Let me help you.

727
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,080
Where's the professional equipment
I asked you to bring?

728
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Are you insane?

729
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,320
What kind of professional equipment is that?

730
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,880
Everyone has it.

731
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,320
The professional one, do you understand?

732
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,800
Professional.

733
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,040
Just kidding.

734
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,960
Why would I ask Gu Chuan to come over?

735
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,960
He used to

736
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,800
take pictures for National Geographic Magazine.

737
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,240
He climbed Mount Everest.

738
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
He's been to the South Pole and the North Pole.

739
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,040
He also took pictures of lions
in the African savanna.

740
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,080
Most of all,

741
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
his equipment is very professional.

742
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,560
I got this.

743
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,800
Rest assured.

744
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,120
Sister Yan Yan, the flowers are about to bloom.

745
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,280
Amazing!

746
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's all take a photo.

747
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Come here.

748
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,760
Here we go.

749
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,840
Get ready.

750
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,360
Both of you.

751
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,560
One forsook friend for love.

752
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,320
One left friend in the lurch.

753
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,400
Just sat by and watched me get beaten.

754
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't get in touch anymore. Bye!

755
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,320
Boss.

756
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Is Mr. Xu really mad?

757
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,600
It's fine. Just get used to it.

758
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,640
The one who should be mad

759
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,760
is Zhao Yan.

760
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,280
Certainly.

761
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,080
It's rare for epiphyllums to bloom.

762
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,680
Boss, I'll drive you home first.

763
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,840
It's been so late.

764
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,160
I'll drive you home first.

765
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,320
All right then.

766
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
Thank you for your hard work, Boss.

767
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,280
Mighty Boss.

768
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Gu.

769
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,760
That's all

770
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,920
for this week.

771
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,040
It has done for

772
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,160
Cheng Hai Apartment.

773
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
The handover has started.

774
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,520
Besides,

775
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,160
there's an internet-famous cafe

776
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,280
that wants Man Lin

777
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,840
to take on their project.

778
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,680
We haven't taken on

779
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,600
the project of a cafe

780
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
for two years,

781
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,160
but this cafe is very famous.

782
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,560
It's a lakeside cafe.

783
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,640
Many tourists consider it

784
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,880
as a snap-worthy cafe.

785
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,080
It's not a big project.

786
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,159
It's just renovation.

787
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,159
There's no need

788
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,239
to mention this small project.

789
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,960
Cheng Dong.

790
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,880
Are you interested in this project?

791
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
It's fine for me.

792
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,199
But they requested

793
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,400
Miss Su to take on.

794
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
I'll handle this.

795
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,760
An internet-famous cafe

796
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,320
is well-known already.

797
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,360
Everyone must be

798
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
looking forward to the renovation.

799
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,920
If you need more helpers,

800
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
you can take Jiang Xiao Ning with you.

801
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,560
All right.

802
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,159
Jiang Xiao Ning is pretty smart.

803
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,560
The proposal of the art gallery

804
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,639
was suggested by her.

805
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,760
I think it's good.

806
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,320
As they've requested,

807
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,560
I'll take it then.

808
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,719
With Jiang Xiao Ning as well.

809
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,520
Thank you, Sister Man Lin.

810
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,199
Thank you, Boss.

811
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,239
I'll work hard.

812
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,600
Take a good look at

813
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,120
Su Man Lin's design proposal

814
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
to get to know her style.

815
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,240
Okay.

816
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,480
I've read it already.

817
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
I'll read it again.

818
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,640
Internet-famous cafe.

819
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,840
That's great.

820
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,800
I didn't expect to get

821
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,160
such a good chance.

822
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,480
Set aside your work first.

823
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,800
Follow me to the site.

824
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,515
(Everyone is responsible for safety.)

825
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,663
(Under construction)
(Do not enter.)

826
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,200
How is it?

827
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,000
Your idea is

828
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
going to be presented.

829
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,040
How do you feel?

830
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,040
It gives me a sense of achievement.

831
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,400
It's the greatest charm

832
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,840
of being a designer.

833
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,280
I believe

834
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,600
there'll be more buildings

835
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,920
designed by you.

836
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,120
You're so confident in me?

837
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,480
I'm confident in myself.

838
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
I want to take a photo with

839
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,240
this sense of achievement.

840
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,800
My phone really ran out of battery this time.

841
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I'll help you then.

842
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,320
Where?

843
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Thank you, Boss.

844
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Here.

845
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,880
Get ready.

846
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,400
Done.

847
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,320
Let me have a look.

848
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,360
Thank you, Boss.

849
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,800
It's awesome.

850
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
I like it very much.

851
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,560
I'll send the photo

852
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,400
to you later.

853
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,400
Thank you, Boss.

854
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,960
Boss.

855
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,120
You look different today.

856
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,280
Let's go.

857
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,480
You look like a teenage boy today.

858
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,520
Why would you have time to come over?

859
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
Mom called me yesterday.

860
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,520
She told me to visit you often when I have time.

861
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Or else we'll gradually

862
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,640
drift apart.

863
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,200
And you won't let me inherit family possessions.

864
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,920
See?

865
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,920
Now you know why I'm not

866
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,520
with your mom anymore.

867
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,400
Because the only thing she cares is money.

868
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,840
Not me.

869
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,680
If money doesn't matter,

870
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,800
why don't you

871
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,240
just get a divorce?

872
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,480
You've been living separately

873
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,360
for so many years.

874
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,360
Oh, right.

875
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,120
I just saw Assistant Liu leaving.

876
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,920
He was here just now.

877
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
There's someone with him

878
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,680
who looks familiar.

879
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,840
Do you know him?

880
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,560
No.

881
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,640
You go with me

882
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,880
and everything will be fine.

883
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,920
But I recognize his eyes.

884
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,040
It reminds me of the one

885
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,200
who tried to rob me.

886
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,280
What did you say?

887
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,720
Someone tried to rob you?

888
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,840
Maybe it's because I have an
outstanding appearance.

889
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,760
You'd better be careful recently.

890
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,280
If such a situation happened again,

891
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,720
let me know right away.

892
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,640
Okay?

893
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Are you afraid that

894
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,960
the robber would demand ransom?

895
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,520
You...

896
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,240
All right, the visiting task is over.

897
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:46,920
I'll leave now.

898
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,080
Leave all your money to my mom,

899
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,560
not me.

900
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't like it, but she does.

901
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
The two owners of the cafe

902
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,560
used to pursue studies

903
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,440
in Britain.

904
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,280
Small events are organized on the first floor.

905
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,040
There's a brand experience platform

906
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,440
integrating catering, retails,

907
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,840
and lifestyle on the second floor.

908
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
Next to it is the lounge.

909
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,240
Before this,

910
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
it was a Scandinavian design.

911
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,040
Okay, I got it.

912
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,560
You can send me the documents.

913
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

914
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,000
Boss.

915
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,960
You need to go out with us.

916
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,960
You'll drive.

917
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Okay.

918
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,520
Pardon me.

919
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm a photographer.

920
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,600
I saw you staring blankly here.

921
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,760
And it matches

922
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,560
the scenery.

923
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
So I took some photos of you.

924
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,440
Is that fine?

925
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,320
Me?

926
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,960
But I'm not good-looking.

927
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,680
You are good-looking.

928
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,360
Don't worry.

929
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,880
These photos

930
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,120
are not for commercial purposes.

931
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,600
I didn't bring my

932
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,720
employee ID card with me.

933
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,120
But I don't have any bad intentions.

934
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,720
I think it looks good,

935
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,160
so I want to snap it for you.

936
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,840
Look.

937
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,800
It looks great indeed.

938
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,120
Thank you.

939
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,960
It's nothing.

940
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,520
It's because you're good-looking.

941
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,680
Could you give me your email?

942
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
I'll send the photos to you.

943
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,480
Or we

944
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,600
can add friends on WeChat?

945
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,320
What do you think?

946
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,920
Okay.

947
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,760
Done.

948
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,920
I'm Chen Wen Wen.

949
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,760
I'm Jiang Xiao Ning.

950
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,840
I'll get going.

951
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,800
I'll send the photos to you.

952
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,400
Okay.

953
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,400
Why is there such a

954
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,200
beautiful and talented fairylike girl?
