1
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,650
You live around here?

2
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,553
Could you put me up tonight?

3
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,496
I've got nowhere to go.

4
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,626
Hey.

5
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,596
WET WOMAN IN THE WIND

6
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,109
Hey mister.

7
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:39,642
Mister!

8
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:45,946
I didn't mean for free! Don't look down on me.

9
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,815
Come on, dude.

10
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:55,722
Well?

11
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:58,128
What would you pay?

12
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,922
Pay? Me?

13
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:04,467
No, shithead. I don't pay, you do.

14
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,702
How's 5,000 yen? It's cheap for the works.

15
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,800
Right, dude?

16
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:25,887
Haven't done it for a while, have you?
I can tell by a guy's skin.

17
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,960
Hey, wait...

18
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,466
Ow...

19
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,607
Hey mister!

20
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,285
You'll regret brushing me off!

21
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,462
I hate being ignored the most!

22
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:11,703
<i>Under the spreading chestnut tree</i>

23
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:16,235
<i>There we sat, both you and me</i>

24
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,601
<i>Oh how happy we would be</i>

25
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:25,110
<i>Under the spreading chestnut tree</i>

26
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:31,015
"Silver knew Bob was telling the truth.
A dull sound...“

27
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:40,388
<i>One day by the A-B-sea,
a crab grabbed on to my pee-pee</i>

28
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:43,389
<i>Ow, ow, let me go!</i>

29
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,927
<i>This sausage is mine now!</i>

30
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:51,668
<i>Merbromin didn't do
a thing Pyoktanin made it hairy</i>

31
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,936
Oh, I get you.

32
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,169
This is cool.

33
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:32,350
I like this. Living alone in the forest.

34
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:37,080
Just go away. You can't stay here,
and I won't pay you.

35
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,416
No.

36
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,453
I've given up women.

37
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,117
Sure you have.

38
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:48,023
Then what's this stiff thing?

39
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:51,827
Bodies don't lie, mister!

40
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,433
Why are you still here?!

41
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,345
You piss me off.

42
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,946
You look down on me!

43
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,315
That's why?

44
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,744
You're like a stray dog.

45
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,087
What? Do I disgust you that much?

46
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,315
A bitch like me should starve and die?

47
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,058
I don't get a second chance?

48
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,897
There are snakes and wild dogs here.

49
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,900
Find shelter before nightfall.

50
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,051
You know, I've locked onto you.

51
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:26,228
Don't think you can escape me. You can't.

52
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:29,592
Thanks.

53
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,092
Was it enough?

54
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,753
Until last night.

55
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,924
It lasted three weeks for lighting.

56
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,763
Sounds about right.

57
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:45,368
Thanks.

58
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:46,875
It's slippery.

59
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:04,458
What'll you do when it gem cold?

60
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:09,866
Won't you want a power line for heating?

61
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:13,229
No, my sleeping bag will be enough.

62
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,296
Anyway, Yuzawa,

63
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:19,236
could we go to Kubouchi's for coffee beans?

64
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,073
Yeah, sure. No problem.

65
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,958
Looks like Kubouchis wife isn't coming back.

66
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,458
His daughter changed schools too.

67
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:39,990
No kidding.

68
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:45,061
Kosuke, wasn't he your university senior?

69
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,429
I found out he was,
but I didn't know him back then.

70
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,131
Is that right?

71
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,711
I thought you knew him well.

72
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,575
No, not at all.

73
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,648
His wife was my junior too.

74
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,310
She was?

75
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,819
You had the same major?

76
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,152
Yeah, English literature.

77
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,764
I didn't know her then though.

78
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,532
You didn't?

79
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:33,412
Oh, hello.

80
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:34,440
Hi.

81
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,388
Hey, Kosuke. It's been a while.

82
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:38,682
Hi.

83
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,454
No way!

84
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,422
Fancy meeting you here...

85
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,892
I'm so sorry for the other day.

86
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,435
Forget it.

87
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,698
What, you two know each other? How?

88
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:59,207
- Well...
- How can I explain about us?

89
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,938
We crossed paths the other day.

90
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,037
I see.

91
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,206
Can we sit there?

92
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,749
Yeah, sure.

93
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,098
What'll you have?

94
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,127
Blended coffee?

95
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,463
Ah, yeah.

96
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:31,108
And Kubouchi, 200 grams of my usual beans.

97
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,409
She's cute, that girl.

98
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,416
She's not your type.

99
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,750
Well, yeah...

100
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:52,830
My ideal woman's one in a hundred million.

101
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:56,190
The kind you meet once in a lifetime.

102
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,663
Kosuke, I wrote another new piece.

103
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,741
Would you listen to it?

104
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,236
Sure.

105
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,069
Okay, if you don't mind.

106
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,415
“You are for me. I know without seeing you.

107
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:26,122
“You are beside me. Growing closer and closer.

108
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,732
“In order to meet me.

109
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:35,204
"To meet only one man, the man of your destiny,

110
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,740
“You approach me silently from behind,

111
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,617
"and smile at me.

112
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,881
"This is no accident.

113
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,483
“Fate has brought us together."

114
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,795
Hey boss.

115
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,135
If making delectable coffee is an art,

116
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:16,112
is having delectable sex an art too?

117
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,481
Is it, boss?

118
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,422
Don't! Don't!

119
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,063
Tell me, what is Kosuke to you?!

120
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,903
Tell me, Shiori!

121
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,671
No, don't!

122
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,672
Aren't these your wife's clothes?

123
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,506
Damn you!

124
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:53,440
No, don't!

125
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:58,112
Don't! They're your wife's clothes!

126
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,321
No, don't!

127
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,061
They're your wife's...

128
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,866
Don't!

129
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,868
Don't, they're your wife's...

130
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,649
<i>"Honesty box”</i>

131
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,087
You're a surfer?

132
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,026
Ah, yeah.

133
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:05,234
Nice hut.

134
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,239
Thanks.

135
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:14,309
It's so weird. This is rain water, right?

136
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,386
Can you filter piss too?

137
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,853
Want to try?

138
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:24,752
Sorry!

139
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,296
So, who are you?

140
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,903
Oh, right. I'm...

141
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,435
Never mind your name.
We won't see each other again.

142
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,211
Oh, okay.

143
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:46,573
<i>Still...</i>

144
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:48,982
Right?

145
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,060
Anyway, I'm a surfer. Surfing's cool.

146
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:05,896
It's totally badass.

147
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,672
Wanna try it sometime?

148
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,240
Hey.

149
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:18,114
You want me now, don't you?

150
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:22,178
But you can't have me. If you do, you'll lose.

151
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:07,025
Yeah?

152
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,125
<i>Don't tell me you were sleeping.</i>

153
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,762
Give me a break.

154
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,397
<i>Wait! Don't hang up.</i>

155
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,207
<i>Listen.</i>

156
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:24,241
<i>That guy from before wants to say thanks.</i>

157
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:25,575
<i>Go on.</i>

158
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,718
<i>I...I...</i>

<i>What the hell?</i>

160
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,886
<i>I told you not to.</i>

161
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,228

<i>Answer me...</i>

172
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,118
Hello.

173
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,359
Nice weather today.

174
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,330
Don't get me wrong.

175
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:26,369
Actually, I've come to get
that smartphone back.

176
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,598
I really need it.
I mean, it belongs to a customer.

177
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,876
They've been asking.

178
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,616
You threw it away?

179
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:51,356
I really need it. I seriously need it.

180
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:54,761
Hey Kosuke, get it for me, please?

181
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:56,662
Get it yourself.

182
00:21:56,822 --> 00:22:00,167
But there are snakes and wild dogs, right?

183
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,497
Hey.

184
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:10,712
What's your problem?

185
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:13,847
Why are you here? What for?

186
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:18,718
I'm a...love hunter.

187
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:27,120
So Kosuke, you did theater in Tokyo?

188
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:30,994
But now you live like this. How come?

189
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:33,066
Want to know?

190
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:34,500
Not really.

191
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,866
I'll tell you anyway.

192
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:47,340
If a person wants to think deeply,
they've got to be alone.

193
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:52,285
Solitude helps, so I want to be alone,
but I'm not right now!

194
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:53,515
Got it?

195
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:55,321
What's that?

196
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,290
What?

197
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:57,792
There it is!

198
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,833
The lord of the forest.

199
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:09,673
It's not a wild dog. It's from a greater realm.

200
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,005
Hey.

201
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:20,442
I've always thought I could be a good actress.
You think so too?

202
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:24,277
I mean, it'd be so cool.

203
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:28,118
Being on stage in the spotlight looks like fun.

204
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:38,324
Stand here. Look there, turn around,
and say “No way."

205
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:41,060
Here? Turn around?

206
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:48,242
No way.

207
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,111
As in what?

208
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,646
As in what?

209
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:56,182
What feeling did it express?
It can have many meanings.

210
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:57,650
No way.

211
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:02,348
That was surprise and recognition.
It can mean more.

212
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:03,994
What about anger?

213
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:06,390
No way!

214
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:08,388
Suspicion.

215
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,125
No way...

216
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,700
Mischief.

217
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,360
No way!

218
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:15,737
Disappointment.

219
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:17,968
No way.

220
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,072
Now let's do “really.“

221
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:23,476
Surprise.

222
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:25,006
Really?

223
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,479
Anger.

224
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:27,680
Really!

225
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,012
Recognition.

226
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,347
Really?!

227
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,681
Suspicion.

228
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,084
Really...?

229
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,324
Confrontation.

230
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:37,091
Really.

231
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:45,800
Hold that end.

232
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,036
No words this time.

233
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:52,037
Anger.

234
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,345
Surprise.

235
00:24:58,604 --> 00:24:59,947
Recognition.

236
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,248
Suspicion.

237
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:08,623
Triumph.

238
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,454
Kubouchi?

239
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:22,056
Dammit! Where is she?!

240
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:23,596
Kubouchi?

241
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:30,472
Where's the girl?

242
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:32,233
What girl?

243
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:34,202
Your waitress?

244
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,471
Did you fuck her?

245
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,774
No I didn't! Are you crazy?!

246
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:41,851
If you touch her,
there's no telling what I'll do.

247
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,050
Kubouchi?

248
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:47,623
Remember Tamaki .

249
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,118
Remember your wife, and child. Please.

250
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:53,092
You've got some nerve.

251
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,160
Am I a joke?

252
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:02,267
Am I a joke to you?!

253
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:03,833
No.

254
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:16,511
No...

255
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,421
Get this, asshole.

256
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:22,615
You fucked up my marriage!

257
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:25,892
My naive small town wife

258
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:30,291
fell for a wannabe intellectual recluse!

259
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,994
Where did you fuck? Your hut? Out in the open?!

260
00:27:34,126 --> 00:27:35,935
You're wrong, Kubouchi.

261
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:39,836
She told me straight. She wanted your body!

262
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:45,407
Listen up. Just try taking my woman again.

263
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,982
I'll kill you!

264
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,364
He kissed you out of anger, right?

265
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,157
Let me go!

266
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,683
You can't have me yet.

267
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:32,679


268
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:35,058
Her name's Shiori, right?

269
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,688
Kubouchi's waitress.

270
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:43,800
I hear she's been hanging
with surfers around here.

271
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:47,227
You know, at Kitahama.

272
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:53,266
One of them came to Kubouchi's cafe.

273
00:29:54,833 --> 00:30:00,476
They just swore at each other at first,
but then Kubouchi got physical.

274
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:08,149
He might have been a tough guy once,

275
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,059
but he's just a middle-aged washout now.

276
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,956
It was a hell of a brawl.

277
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:20,959
What about his wife?

278
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,267
She won't answer his calls.

279
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:29,278
Even the hospital couldn't get hold of her.

280
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,171
I hear you got into quite a brawl.

281
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:30,534
Kind of.

282
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:34,841
You've got to laugh, right?

283
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,043
Yeah.

284
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,689
Oh, this.

285
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,421
I couldn't believe it.

286
00:31:57,055 --> 00:32:01,697
I took off my ring for a second,
and that girl swallowed it.

287
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:05,808
I couldn't make her cough it up.

288
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:12,347
Now it's in her guts, soaking in piss and shit.
Or just shit.

289
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:15,616
Hey, you okay?

290
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,650
Sorry. I feel a bit sick.

291
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:22,855
You haven't been eating well.

292
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:27,028
Living out there like that is too hard on you.

293
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:32,201
You know where the cafe Key's hidden.

294
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:38,139
There's food in the kitchen. Eat it.
Use the room upstairs.

295
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:44,477
Why are you being so kind to me?

296
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,179
By way of apology?

297
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:52,753
Well, there's that, but if Tamaki calls...

298
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:56,184
...I want you to give her a message.

299
00:32:57,115 --> 00:33:01,621
I want to start over.
Tell her I want to do that.

300
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,266
For the record,

301
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:12,769
there really was nothing between us.

302
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:18,140
I know. Let's put that behind us.

303
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,974
I'm over it now.

304
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:22,144
Okay?

305
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:47,339
Well,

306
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,073
okay.

307
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:52,711
Yuzawa?

308
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,911
When Kubouchi gets out,
could you give him this?

309
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:02,752
Tell him it's from Shiori.

310
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:08,491
Be sure not to mention my name.

311
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,831
No excuses, but it wasn't my fault.

312
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:25,413
Got it.

313
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:30,576
I'll make sure I don't mention you at all.

314
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,021
I'll bury it inside me...

315
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:35,352
Hey.

316
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:41,927
Okay, I'm counting on you.

317
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:24,730
Long time no see.

318
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:30,104
What? 'Trouble in Mind" again?

319
00:35:31,937 --> 00:35:36,511
Come on, I came all the way
from Tokyo to see you.

320
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:39,983
My feminine intuition's razor-sharp.

321
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:41,891
Girl problems?

322
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,822
Don't smoke in here!

323
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:53,796
You suddenly said you wanted to be alone.

324
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:59,808
I was worried you might have
killed yourself somewhere.

325
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:05,905
I came here to get away from women!
So please, leave me alone!

326
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:09,018
No way, Kosuke baby!

327
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:12,916
Go or I'll rape you.

328
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:14,455
Go ahead.

329
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:26,096
Check it out. Fresh, right?

330
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,105
New theater troupe members.

331
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:31,840
- I'm Aoki.
- I'm Midorikawa.

332
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,500
- I'm Kurita.
- I'm Kuwano.

333
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:46,348
She's my assistant.
An ardent fan of playwright Kosuke Kashiwagi.

334
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:51,461
I'm Yuko Sanjo.

335
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:04,632
We were on our way to perform
in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Akita,

336
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,470
until last night's earthquake.

337
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,737
Earthquake?

338
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:12,915
Didn't you feel it?
So let us stay today and tomorrow.

339
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:15,644
Stay? Where will you all sleep?

340
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:20,483
Don't worry. We've got a tent,
and we're used to it.

341
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:23,125
We can make our own food too.

342
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:32,696
So, this is the head?

343
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:33,768
Indeed.

344
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,496
What of the torso?

345
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:39,632
Look, as I said,
it does not exist in this world.

346
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:44,042
What? There is a head, but no torso?

347
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:48,508
There is undeniably
a woman's severed head here,

348
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:51,586
but you say her body does not exist?

349
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:53,188
Indeed.

350
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:55,216
- Indeed?
- Indeed.

351
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,553
Chief Judge, as I said before...

352
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:58,787
Who might you be?

353
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,861
An innkeeper.

354
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:04,629
Speak.

355
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:10,571
It all began on my inn's street
in our post town,

356
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:14,199
when lo and behold, from a knothole in a wall,

357
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:17,677
a woman's head began startling passersby.

358
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:23,218
She was quite beautiful,
but did not reveal herself.

359
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:27,687
She merely laughed out loud,
and upon trying to touch her,

360
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:31,692
she vanished into the hole.
My guests were terrified.

361
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:37,596
The townspeople agreed to employ
this famous swordsman,

362
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:43,399
and when he swung his blade down on her neck,

363
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:48,273
her translucent head fell in a spray of blood,

364
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,873
and rolled on the ground,
but there was nothing beyond the knothole.

365
00:38:53,972 --> 00:38:55,417
<i>Beyond, you w?</i>

366
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,486
By beyond, I mean my inn's, er...

367
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:00,486
Its courtyard.

368
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,759
The woman was in there?

369
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:06,829
No sir, as I said,
there was no one beyond the wall,

370
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:11,985
but a beautiful woman's head protruded
from a knothole...

371
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:13,058
This head?

372
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,135
Indeed.

373
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:16,034
And you severed it?

374
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:17,571
Indeed.

375
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,845
Therefore, you are the perpetrator
of this murder!

376
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:25,915
Chief Judge. As I said,

377
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:30,711
this Vagabond swordsman
is not a murderer of women...

378
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:33,118
Enough, enough, enough!

379
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:41,124
Your movements are uniform,
but your emotions shouldn't be!

380
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:44,233
What would that convey to your audience?

381
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:50,567
Could it convey what you've seen
and heard to your audience?

382
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,873
Probably not.

383
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:59,211
Alright, switch roles again.

384
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:01,408
You switch with him.

385
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,753
You two switch too.

386
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:09,951
Got it? Understand others' roles
to understand your own.

387
00:40:10,548 --> 00:40:11,925
Do it again.

388
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:14,755
Ready...

389
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,064
Go!

390
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:17,799
So, this is the head?

391
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:18,957
Indeed.

392
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,626
What of the torso?

393
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:26,068
Isn't this my script?

394
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:27,570
It is.

395
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,250
How are my boys doing?

396
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:42,281
Er, well...I'm not sure "doing“
is the right word.

397
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:44,186
You're right.

398
00:40:44,382 --> 00:40:46,623
It all began on my inn's street...

399
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:47,923
Enough!

400
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:52,867
Are you kidding me? That was awful.

401
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:57,770
There's no soul in it.
Are you happy with that, as actors?

402
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:58,907
No.

403
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,771
It's bad, isn't it?

404
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,670
Oh crap. Are you kidding me?

405
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,013
Who's she?

406
00:41:17,515 --> 00:41:19,825
A local stray dog on the loose.

407
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,225
That's your 'Trouble in Mind"?

408
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,301
Don't. Leave her alone!

409
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:34,575
Seems you've been watching our rehearsals.

410
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,837
How were they? Tell me what you think.

411
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:51,158
What, can't she talk?

412
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:59,358
I get it.

413
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,837
Kosuke called you a stray dog,

414
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:05,903
so you're pretending to be one.

415
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,005
I like it.

416
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,877
You're a dog then.

417
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,779
A dog named Oscar.

418
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:21,781
You're on a desert island with your owner.

419
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,255
You're a dog, so you can't talk,

420
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,261
but you want to tell him something.

421
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:35,503
Well? Want to try acting out that little etude?

422
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,365
Improvised theater.

423
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:40,676
No way. Not a shitty premise like that.

424
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:44,142
How can actors follow such shitty direction?

425
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:50,512
You shitty ideas are
killing their performances, don't you think?

426
00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:55,786
You're right.

427
00:42:56,915 --> 00:43:00,522
I'll think of another premise then.
Give me a second.

428
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:04,030
No, I'll do it. The one you came up with.

429
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:09,034
But I'll add something.

430
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:15,737
This bitch with a message for her owner

431
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:18,642
has used magic to become human,

432
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:22,011
but each step I take is agony.

433
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:25,247
The spell is about to wear off.

434
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:30,226
When it wears off, I'll become a dog again.

435
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:35,220
I'll never be able to see my owner again.

436
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:49,971
What's wrong? Oscar? Oscar?

437
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,209
What is it? Oscar?

438
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:07,520
What's wrong, Oscar? Oscar? Oscar?

439
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,885
Okay!

440
00:44:53,264 --> 00:44:55,210
What the hell is she?

441
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:02,374
What's really going on
between you and that girl?

442
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:05,754
Explain it to me properly.

443
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:06,548
She's just a...

444
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:11,354
Come on, don't give me that
dog and bicycle crap!

445
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:14,622
I know you can't live without women!

446
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:19,963
Celibacy? What a joke.
You're a chronic womanizer.

447
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:25,435
Back in Tokyo, all the furious men
you've stolen women from

448
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:29,703
are eagerly awaiting your return.
What'll you do?

449
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:32,370
I've never done that!

450
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,247
I'm sick of listening to your excuses!

451
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:38,616
Kiss me.

452
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:40,653
- What the hell?
- Please!

453
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:44,191
<i>Ow ow ow'. Come on...</i>

454
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:45,918
Kosuke!

455
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:51,300
I'll just touch you.

456
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:10,311
I'll just get naked.

457
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:36,973
I'll just ride you.

458
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,380
Ow!

459
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,019
Where's everybody?

460
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:10,354
They left. For Fukushima.

461
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:13,953
Then why are you still here?

462
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:19,932
I want to be of service to you.

463
00:55:20,457 --> 00:55:22,459
Ms. Kyoko agreed to it.

464
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:45,857
I wasn't your first, was I?

465
00:55:49,153 --> 00:55:50,427
No.

466
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:52,962
There was somebody else?

467
00:56:02,766 --> 00:56:04,905
What kind of guy was he?

468
00:56:08,439 --> 00:56:10,817
My high school P.E. teacher.

469
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:15,822
One summer after class,
he forced himself on me.

470
00:56:17,781 --> 00:56:19,124
<i>Oh.</i>

471
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,952
That's a painful memory.

472
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:26,195
But the power's in your hands.

473
00:56:26,857 --> 00:56:31,806
To overcome your past and walk on.
To go wherever you like.

474
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,575
But sir...

475
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:40,415
You don't need to say goodbye.

476
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,078
It's time to go.

477
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:49,322
Someone's waiting for you
at the end of your journey.

478
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:52,054
Go.

479
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,657
But...

480
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,530
But...

481
00:57:04,128 --> 00:57:05,471
Sir!

482
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:11,808
Go.

483
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,559
Yeah, bring it!

484
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,970
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

485
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:09,168
I can't take any more of this!

486
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:13,742
You feel the same too, don't you? Don't you?

487
01:02:14,404 --> 01:02:17,248
Then you get naked too!

488
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,813
"You are beside me.

489
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:56,555
“Growing closer and closer.

490
01:02:58,014 --> 01:03:00,426
"In order to meet me.“

491
01:04:47,624 --> 01:04:50,662
It thrills me...It touches me...

492
01:04:51,127 --> 01:04:52,936
It electrifies me...

493
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:59,203
It makes me want to cry! I can't help myself!

494
01:05:00,937 --> 01:05:02,644
I can't help myself!

495
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,784
I can feel it washing over me!

496
01:06:29,526 --> 01:06:32,598
“Your one-in-a-hundred-million fingers,

497
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:36,841
“your slender white fingers

498
01:06:39,035 --> 01:06:41,447
"gently embrace me,

499
01:06:46,843 --> 01:06:49,255
“so I...

500
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,282
Yeah?

501
01:10:08,044 --> 01:10:11,719
Oh, Mrs. Kubouchi. It's Kashiwagi. Yes.

502
01:10:12,315 --> 01:10:15,489
No, he's not out yet. No.

503
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:20,493
Er, he asked me to give you...a message. Yes.

504
01:10:21,024 --> 01:10:24,801
Er, "I still want to...

505
01:10:25,895 --> 01:10:30,207
“...bend you over...“
Wait, he said “start over.“ Yes.

506
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:34,041
"Start over.“ “Bend you over." No, wait...

507
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:38,184
No, Mrs. Kubouchi, wait. Wait! Wait!

508
01:14:00,843 --> 01:14:02,379
Where to?

509
01:14:06,716 --> 01:14:08,423
With you?

510
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:10,821
Anywhere.

This story is a work of fiction.

Any resemblance to actual persons,
