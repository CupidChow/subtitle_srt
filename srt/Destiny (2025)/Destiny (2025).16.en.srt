[Chu Xingyan's Press Conference]

4
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,710
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,810
I am Chu Xingyan.

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,930
The reason for holding
this press conference today

7
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,810
is to address a few things.

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm sure you've all seen

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,240
or heard about

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,280
my so-called “threesome” video.

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,380
I used to think it was all fake,

12
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,730
so there was no need to respond.

13
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,210
I didn’t want to fall into the trap
of proving my innocence.

14
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,830
But recently...

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,760
I met someone

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,330
who touched my heart.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,130
I'm afraid this might hurt her.

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,539
So I've been afraid to accept her love.

19
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,110
But now,

20
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,970
I want to change for her.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,229
At least,

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,720
I don't want her to think

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,520
she's fallen for a coward.

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,789
So I'm here to make things clear.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,120
I, Chu Xingyan,

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,060
have never

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
done it and will

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,260
never do such things.

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,830
The video circulating online is fake.

30
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,080
It's fabricated.

31
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,930
I hope everyone doesn't believe the rumors

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,650
or spread them.

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,850
[Chu Xingyan]

34
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,630
Ah, Chu Xingyan finally responded!

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,079
The girl he's talking about
must be Lin Haohao, right?

36
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,079
Oh my god, it's practically
a public love confession!

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,480
I hate an artist with scandals,

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,610
but I really do
ship the HaoYan couple.

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,630
If Lin Haohao forgives him,

40
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,700
maybe he didn't do it.

41
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,360
Excuse me.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
He's a playboy with scandals.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,500
Lin Haohao won't forgive him.

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
How does he explain the hotel video?

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Agreed.

46
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,130
Right.

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
Lin Haohao just entered the livestream!

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,740
She sent a smile emoji!

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,790
Oh, HaoYan couple is becoming a real couple!

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,960
That girl you mentioned
in the press conference today,

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,420
who is she?

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,120
Who?

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,020
How would I know?
You didn't say her name.

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,900
Take a guess.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,200
I can't guess.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Then forget it.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
Alright, forget it.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,360
Anyway, it's my...

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,440
girlfriend.

60
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,790
Hey,

61
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,579
doesn't your girlfriend have a name?

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,630
Her name is Little Eel.

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey!

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,079
What are you doing?

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,500
What's wrong?

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,800
Aren't you going home?

67
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,220
We just officially got together.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,390
It's 8:30 PM now.

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,140
You're letting your girlfriend
go home alone?

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
I just didn't want you to think I'm...

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
a...

72
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,270
Alright.

73
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,540
Please drive me home.

74
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,589
Mr. Chu...

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,150
Why are you asking him?

76
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,970
He asked you to drive me home.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,020
Song Ruan.

78
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,800
I want to go home.

79
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,830
Are you really leaving?

80
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,180
What?

81
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,159
I was just kidding.

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,330
Hmm.

83
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,840
Something is

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,480
different here tonight.

85
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,730
What's different?

86
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,060
It's just not quite the same.

87
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,880
Would you...

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,800
like something to drink?

89
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,030
I'll have some water.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,050
Why are you being
so gentlemanly today?

91
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,440
Because if I’m not,

92
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,400
someone might not get
to go home for a week.

93
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,530
What do you mean?

94
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,510
That's exactly
what you’re thinking.

95
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,480
Then you'd better
be a gentleman.

96
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,570
I'm your girlfriend now.

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,710
I don't go home tonight.

98
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,390
I'll sleep on the couch.

99
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,360
Sleep on the couch?

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Okay.

101
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Okay?

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,680
Thank you.

103
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Are you hungry?

104
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,830
Do you want to eat ramen?

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop tempting me.

106
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,970
Why are you standing so far away?

107
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,910
Come here.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,240
What?

109
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Come here.

110
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,410
They say

111
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
if two people’s palm lines

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,130
can match up perfectly,

113
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,010
they’re destined to be together.

114
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,560
You need a blanket.

115
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,650
A blanket?

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Good night.

117
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,330
Good night.

118
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,110
I'm about to sleep.

119
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,790
I'll get a cup of water.

120
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,370
You go to sleep.

121
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,210
Good night.
