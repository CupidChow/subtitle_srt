Compared to your magazine,

10
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,460

You can't be just another fish in the player's pond.

This is the highest-rated variety show in the country.

I don't understand what you need to consider.

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,120
Why did we come to this city?

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,620
It was for Le's movie.

I can be the bad guy here.

When we're at the cusp of opportunity,

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,360
we should cash in as soon as possible.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,310
Not everyone gets this kind of chance.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,360
I studied acting in school.

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,420
My dream is to become a real actor,

41
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,079
not some internet celebrity.

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,980
This year, I must transform and get back on track.

43
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,060
What's wrong with earning a little less?

44

The market favors you now.

What's wrong with being an internet celebrity?

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,500
Capital follows popularity.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,290
Being an actor is a craftsman's path,

48
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,540
getting narrower as you go.

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,420
Every step is like climbing a mountain.

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,579
In other words,

you don't have faith in me, right?

53

I didn't say that.

54
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,750
I just think it's difficult,

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,220
and not cost-effective.

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,740
Le's film will take over three months to shoot.

57
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,700
The pay is low, and you can't take time off.

58
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,420
It will affect your exposure.

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,620
Plus, making a movie is very stressful.

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,300
If the box office performance is poor,

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,100
it will affect your reputation.

daring to let me film this.

190
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,600
He's not afraid of ruining his image.

191
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,880
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Song.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,670
Let me see.

193
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,660
Just film in this direction.

194
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,289
But this way, I can only film your back.

195
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,659
Hey, don't worry about it.

196
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,860
Focus on her face.

197
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,890
Zoom in a bit.

198
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,940
Who's that?

199
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,420
Miss Song is

200
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,460
a documentary director for the famous magazine “Ripple”.

201
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,540
She's currently filming a documentary about me.

202
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,620
Come closer, closer.

203
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,820
Come on, come closer.

204
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,320
Move in.

205
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,580
Didn't I tell you

206
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,810
we need to talk seriously about work?

207
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,680
Mom,

208
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
cooperating with the filming is my work.

209
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,620
We're aiming for authenticity.

210
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,510
Right, Miss Song?

211
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,780
Mom?

212
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,330
Don't mind the camera.

213
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,020
Say whatever you want to say.

214
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,480
Speak freely.

215
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,240
You know what I want to say.

216
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,860
I've carefully nurtured you since you were little,

217
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,420
invested so much time and energy in you.

218
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,180
I hoped you would inherit the family business,

219
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,460
not to be here filming this and that.

220
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,060
How much longer are you going to mess around

221
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,740
before you seriously return to the company?

222
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,060
What do you mean by not serious?

223
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,700
Is my work not serious?

224
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,790
Or are you saying Miss Song isn't serious?

225
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,740
Does she look unserious to you?

226
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,200
Even if you don't respect my choices,

227
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
you should at least respect Miss Song.

228
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,860
Can respect be eaten as food?

229
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,060
Can it take the family business to the next level?

230
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,140
Why not?

231
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,350
I'm not laughing at you,

232
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,030
but after being an actor for so many years,

233
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,580
have you won Best Actor

234
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,100
or Best Newcomer?

235
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,390
Has the industry ever recognized you?

236
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,430
I will get it.

237
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,310
I won't let you continue this nonsense.

238
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,930
I've arranged everything.

239
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,700
You can decide for yourself.

240
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,780
Cut, cut, cut! Stop filming.

241
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,990
Did you get all that?

242
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
It's been filmed.

243
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,700
Top-tier celebrity.

244
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
Despite family opposition,

245
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,060
persisting in pursuing an acting career.

246
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,540
This material is quite inspiring.

247
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,520
What the hell?

248
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,170
What are you doing?

249
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,230
Let's do a test shoot today,

250
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,340
to see how professional you are.

251
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,760
Don't take my card.

252
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,780
Chu Xingyan.

253
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,780
Confiscated.

254
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,740
You said I could film, but now you're asking me not to?

255
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,940
You can't take advantage

256
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
of my good nature.

257
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm going to use this opportunity today

258
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,630
to teach you a harsh lesson.

259
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,420
In this world,

260
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
not everyone can do things happily.

261
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,220
I can't,

262
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,380
and neither can you.
