[Episode 6]

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,290
I must be too tired lately.

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,920
I can't believe I dreamed about Chu Xingyan.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,880
It's absurd.

6
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,900
You're done for.

7
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:50,870
Look at you.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,250
Now you can't stop talking about Chu Xingyan.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,600
Isn't this just a case of "what you think about during the day,

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,970
you dream about at night"?

11
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,620
This dream is reminding you

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
not to constantly avoid and suppress your feelings.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,600
But you don't know what kind of person he is.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
He's dangerous.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,239
He's always trying to lure me

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,519
into his trap.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,250
But once I fall for it,

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,700
I'm finished.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,039
Fortune favors the bold, babe.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,320
If he wants to lure you,

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,660
you can turn the tables and use him instead.

22
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,380
Use him?

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,590
Think about it.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,150
What's the most important thing for you right now?

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,350
It's to make an excellent documentary,

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,550
establish yourself at that magazine,

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,310
and then become a real

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,140
director with a Douban entry.

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,030
And him?

30
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,960
He's a top celebrity,

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
with so many fans.

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,060
He's a huge treasure trove in himself.

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,630
If he wants to play, then play along.

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,289
While he's interested in you,

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,660
quickly dig up stories and secrets about him.

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,990
You might even make a hit out of it.

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,390
But isn't that a bit unethical?

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,720
Such a good opportunity,

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,110
and you're still hesitating?

40
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,820
Don't you want to get your degree anymore?

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,979
Don't you want to establish yourself at that magazine anymore?

42
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't you want to achieve your grand dream anymore?

43
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,690
I do.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,250
That's more like it.

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,400
However,

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,350
this is just a game after all.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
You're both players.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,300
Each taking what you need.

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,040
Just don't fall for real.

50
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,240
Do you understand?

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,120
Okay,

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,340
I understand.

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,530
You're like this,

54
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,910
it's kind of scary.

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,270
Hello.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,820
Hello, Miss Song, right?

57
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,840
This is what Mr. Chu asked us to deliver to you.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,170
He invites you to attend tonight's party.

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,720
Mr. Chu?

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,640
Yes, Mr. Chu.

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,720
Thank you.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,650
You're welcome.

63
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,630
So what is this?

64
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,600
A gown?

65
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,990
Miss,

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,380
who are you?

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,240
Chu Xingyan sent me.

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,150
The male lead?

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,920
What's your relationship with him?

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,550
I'm the director of his documentary.

71
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,970
This is my invitation.

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,040
[Invitation]

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,260
Your invitation doesn't seem right.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,180
It's not right?

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Then I'll give him a call.

76
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay.

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
Hello?

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,550
Zhu Yan,

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,490
I've arrived at the banquet venue.

80
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,580
Where is Chu Xingyan?

81
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,760
Banquet?

82
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,290
Xingyan has a schedule today.

83
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,330
He can't make it.

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,640
He's shooting a poster right now.

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,320
Ah?

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,649
It wasn't from him.

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,500
Then who gave it to you?

88
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,400
I've seen plenty of girls

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,920
who pretended to be fans and tried to sneak in.

90
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,780
Get out of here.

91
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm not pretending.

92
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,450
What are you doing?

93
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,090
Wait.

94
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,909
Miss Lin.

95
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,360
I know this lady.

96
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,970
She is indeed Xingyan's friend.

97
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,110
Alright.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,500
She's wearing a knockoff, isn't she?

99
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,640
Comparing them side by side,

100
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,860
the quality is obviously different.

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,030
Her hair is so outdated too.

102
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,720
Must be a newcomer to the industry.

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,520
Daring to wear the same clothes as Lin Haohao.

104
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Does she really think anyone can play the lead role?

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,320
Imitating without success.

106
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
Bringing shame upon herself.

107
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,160
It's only because Haohao is kind enough to help her.

108
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, it's alright.

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,040
It's just a dress.

110
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,120
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
It's just

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
we happen to like the same things.

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
However,

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,220
some things

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
are not meant for you

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,160
just because you like them.

117
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,480
Come on,

118
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
let's have some snacks.

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
So it's you.

120
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,880
I... what about me?

121
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
You...

122
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,880
Jiang Feng.

123
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,960
You came at the right time.

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
It's rare that Miss Song and I met here.

125
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,640
Could you take a photo for us?

126
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Sure.

127
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,970
I don't want to take a photo!

128
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Is she crazy?

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,640
That's Lin Haohao!

130
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,120
Security!

131
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,490
Where's the security?

132
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,010
Here.

133
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,960
Get this woman out of here.

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,690
Understood.

135
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,920
I'll leave on my own!

136
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,780
Don't touch me!

137
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,690
I'm late.

139
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,890
Weren't you shooting a poster?

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,620
Since you were waiting for me,

141
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,310
of course I had to finish shooting quickly.

142
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,620
Xingyan, why are you here?

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,670
Let me introduce everyone.

144
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,760
This is Song Ruan from "Ripple" magazine,

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,900
a very talented director and editor,

146
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,610
and the main person in charge of my personal documentary.

147
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,110
She's also a very good friend of mine.

148
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,890
I don't want anyone

149
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,720
to be disrespectful

150
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,830
or unfriendly towards her.

151
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,380
Just friends?

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
Well,

153
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,700
that's our secret.

154
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,380
If you're interested,

155
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,530
please pay attention to Director Song's documentary.

156
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,920
You might even see yourself from earlier.

157
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,260
Xingyan, you might have misunderstood.

158
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,960
Today, Miss Song and I just happened to

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
be in the same outfit.

160
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,040
I didn't expect everyone would...

161
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
I gave her this dress.

162
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,470
I just thought

163
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,550
it looked more suitable on Miss Song.

164
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,050
And it turns out

165
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,960
she looks more beautiful in it.

166
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,480
You must be hungry.

167
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,300
Let's go get something to eat.

168
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,510
Why did you do that just now?

169
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,880
It was clearly Lin Haohao using your name

170
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,340
to deliberately tease me.

171
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
You know, your brain usually works pretty well,

172
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,970
but why do you always fall for it

173
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,120
in such situations?

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
Next time something like this happens,

175
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
report to me in advance.

176
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,760
Understand?

177
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,220
Oh.

178
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
So,

179
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,640
from now on, just stick with me.

180
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,280
Hold on tight to my leg,

181
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,240
and no one will dare to bully you.

182
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,210
Are you sure

183
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,110
Chu Xingyan would still want to go back to the past with you?

184
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,840
Xingyan, have you seen this news?

185
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,670

[Top trending: A popular young male star with a surname starting with "C" and a three-character name involved in a hotel threesome]

187
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,560
a popular young male star with a surname starting with "C" and a three-character name

188
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
was involved in a hotel threesome.

189
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,970
People online are guessing it's you.

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,820
This news comes with a video screenshot.

192
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,680
They really caught you on camera.

193
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,620
This is the hotel you stayed in when you were shooting a MV.

195
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,799
Although the face is pixelated,

196
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,200
the slippers on the feet

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,960
are clearly the star slippers

198
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
that your fan club gave you.

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,570
Think carefully about what happened.

200
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,400
If someone has any inappropriate videos,

201
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,260
your career could really be over.

202
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,220
Jiang Feng!

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,880
Jiang Feng.

204
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,880
What's your take on the trending topic

205
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,990
about Chu Xingyan's hotel threesome?

206
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,760
I'm not very familiar with Chu Xingyan's affairs.

207
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,220
He is indeed very charming,

208
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,560
so it's normal for him to have many friends of the opposite sex.

209
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,990
Could you be more specific?

210
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,470
Say a few words about it.

211
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,490
Song Ruan?

212
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,650
Who is Song Ruan?

213
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,380
This

214
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,500
is Chu Xingyan's recent

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,920
good friend,

216
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,150
and also the director in charge of shooting his personal documentary.

217
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,280
She must know Chu Xingyan better than I do.

218
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,590
Song Ruan! Song Ruan!

219
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,250
Song Ruan!

220
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,080
Song Ruan! Song Ruan!

221
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,840
Why did Chu Xingyan choose you to shoot

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,940
his personal documentary?

223
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,920
Is Chu Xingyan's private life

224
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,100
really as chaotic as they say?

225
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,360
Can you give us some insight?

226
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,040
You're just a young girl,

227
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
why did they choose you to film?

228
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,360
Please answer directly.

229
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,680
What's your relationship with him?

230
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,480
Please answer directly.

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,030
During my filming period,

232
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,530
he didn't engage in any immoral behavior,

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,660
nor did he have any improper relationships with anyone of the opposite sex.

234
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,460
I hope everyone doesn't believe the rumors online

235
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,360
or the malicious guidance of ill-intentioned people.

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,280
Song Ruan.

237
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,760
What exactly is the relationship between you two?

238
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,680
Song Ruan.

239
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,280
Why did he ask you to film a personal documentary?

240
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,140
Say something.

241
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,920
We want to know something exclusive.
