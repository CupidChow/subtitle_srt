00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,340
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,080
If you can't handle your alcohol, don't drink.

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Who said that I can't handle my alcohol?

5
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,900
Who said that?

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,120
I did.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,180
Who? I'll show him.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
Xingyan's stomach medicine is on the nightstand.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Fetch it for me, will you?

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,190
Is your stomach still hurting?

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,850
Have some water.

12
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,240
That's what you get for drinking so much.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,440
If you keep drinking like that, you'll ruin your stomach.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,789
Those investors are really something.

15
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,440
Forcing you to drink...

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
If I hadn't been drinking with them,

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
you think they'd have let you off...

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,090
along with Song Ruan, that easily?

19
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,630
Why are you acting like a gentleman now?

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,160
You're already this drunk.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,759
How drunk am I?

22
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,539
I know my limits.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
This is nothing.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Get me two more beers.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
I can knock them back easily.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
Go get 'em.

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,380
Knock them back?

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,720
Let's see how you knock them back.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,330
Knock them back.

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,130
Knock them back, knock them back.

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,590
Knock them back, knock them back.

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,160
Knock them back, knock them back.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,850
Still want to drink more?

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
No, no more.

36
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,560
Everything comes at a cost.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,640
The more you want...

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,280
the more you have to lose.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,480
I just want to... act well...

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,340
to be an ordinary actor.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,530
But it's not that easy.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,680
Alright.

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,790
I've seen how much you've suffered

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,829
for your acting career all these years.

45
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:40,160
Heaven won't let down someone who strives for their dreams.

46
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,730
But we need to take it step by step.

47
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,960
Your health comes first.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,600
If you keep drinking like this,

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,930
you'll end up with a perforated stomach.

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,320
Then you'll only be able to play patients.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
Your range of roles will be limited!

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,920
Can you stop jinxing me?

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm taking my meds, aren't I?

54
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,390
Good boy.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Here is the medicine.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,650
Take your medicine.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Hurry, hurry.

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,960
Chu Xingyan.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,300
What kind of person...

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,930
are you really?

61
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,790
How's the sunlight?

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,530
Can we shoot against the backlight?

63
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,440
Just walk forward.

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
Looks good like this.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,250
Don't run.

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,560
Later, we...

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,750
we still have one more set to shoot.

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,880
We have one more set.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
We still have one more set coming up.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,720
Strike a few more handsome poses.

71
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,760
Be careful.

72
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,770
Dengdeng, it's you again!

73
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,450
Dengdeng!

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,959
This is a dog that's easily swayed by beauty.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,959
It seems a bit scared.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Have some.

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,270
What did you major in during college?

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,680
I majored in directing and screenwriting.

79
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,070
Chu Xingyan.

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Are you... free tonight?

81
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,890
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

82
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,870
Sure.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,640
Hey.

84
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,620
I cooked a few dishes.

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Though they might not be up to Michelin standards,

86
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,010
at least here

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,340
you don't have to worry about paparazzi.

88
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,360
It's okay.

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,420
I don't go to Michelin-starred restaurants every day.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,120
You...

91
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
live here alone?

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,040
How is that possible?

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
It's such a big house.

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,780
I live here with my bestie.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
But she went out with someone today.

96
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,960
You deliberately sent her away, didn't you?

97
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,220
Don't talk nonsense.

98
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,730
She'll be back soon.

99
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,240
Don't get any funny ideas.

100
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,780
Sit down.

101
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't they look pretty good?

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
And you even made my favorite scrambled eggs.

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,370
It's my treat today.

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
I'll drink beer, and you'll drink tea.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,320
You drink beer, and I drink tea?

106
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,650
That won't do. I'll have a little.

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,890
You can only have tea tonight.

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Fine.

109
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,780
Let me try it.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,420
Making so many delicious dishes

111
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,820
and being so nice to me...

112
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,440
What are you up to?

113
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,430
Actor Chu Xingyan, congratulations to you

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,840
on your sixth anniversary in the industry.

115
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,290
That's enough.

116
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,840
Slow down.

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,610
Stop drinking, stop drinking.

118
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,520
You finished the can?

119
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,480
Yeah.

120
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,200
Thank you.

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,610
But I've only been in the industry for four years.

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,760
But six years ago,

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,800
you performed in your first play at school.

124
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,580
How do you know that?

125
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,490
I'm your documentary director.

126
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,780
Of course I need to know enough about you.

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,400
Actually, I want to tell you today

128
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,650
that perseverance is a very precious quality.

129
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,780
Look at how successful you are now,

130
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,320
yet you still haven't forgotten your original intention of being an actor.

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,650
That's really amazing.

132
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
So,

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,760
you must never give up.

134
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,690
You will definitely become

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,420
an exceptionally good actor.

136
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,250
Another can?

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
That's enough.

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,750
Actually, there's one more thing I want to ask you today.

139
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,580
What is it?

140
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,190
Chu Xingyan,

141
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,490
you love to flirt with me so much.

142
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,950
Do you really like me,

143
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,570
or are you just playing the field?

144
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,169
You're drunk after just two cans of beer?

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,690
Or...

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,970
are you using this kind of behavior...

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,460
to deliberately hide something?

148
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,880
Well...

149
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,360
I...

150
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,510
Chu Xingyan.

151
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
I want to ask you...

152
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,850
in your eyes,

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,960
what kind of person am I?

154
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,170
Am I

155
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,310
just a woman you want to conquer?

156
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,060
Or

157
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,690
simply a colleague you work with?

158
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,730
Those things...

159
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,810
those things you said to me before—

160
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
d-did you mean them?

161
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,540
Do you say things like that to every woman,

162
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,240
or are those just casual remarks?

163
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,960
You...

164
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,540
you'd better remember what you're like right now.

165
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,420
