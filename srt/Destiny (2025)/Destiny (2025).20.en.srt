[Destiny]

2
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,390
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,440
Chu Xingyan.

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,360
I came here today

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,260
to say goodbye to you.

6
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,330
The documentary footage is enough.

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,730
We can stop filming now.

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,340
What do you mean?

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
You're my girlfriend.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,040
Even if the filming is over,

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,540
you can stay by my side.

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,230
What's wrong with you?

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,620
What do you want?

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,960
What's wrong?

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,660
Even if we

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,820
explain things clearly,

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,340
it won't mean anything.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,690
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,490
Ruan.

20
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,840
Ruan!

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,420
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,770
Shouldn't you be filming now?

23
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,450
You just ran out.

24
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,250
You're being irresponsible.

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,840
You're making over 100 people

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,880
adjust time for you.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,870
You know there are
over 100 people on set,

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,400
and you also know
I have a busy schedule today.

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,450
And you dropped
this bombshell on me?

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Why do you come

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
and go as you please

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
in my world?

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,670
I was too naive.

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,850
Only today did I realize

35
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,140
the gap between us is so big.

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,200
Your family,

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,079
your fans and your friends,

38
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,800
no one will ever bless us.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
I don't want you

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,440
to bear unnecessary pressure

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,400
because of me.

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,760
And I'm also afraid to

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,700
face those bad comments.

44
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,850
Chu Xingyan.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,079
We...

46
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,230
Ruan, why are you so silly?

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,620
That big star Chu Xingyan

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,280
is still shining
because of you.

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,740
You lit up his world.

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,930
You saved his dreams.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,600
How could you not
be good enough for him?

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
He's the one who
isn't good enough for you.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,700
Do you understand?

54
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,900
Ruan.

55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm not as good as you think.

56
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,360
You've seen me at my lowest.

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,800
You know my
most unbearable secrets.

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,010
You're the one who's

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,780
always been closest to me.

60
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,130
But you're a big star.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,480
Every move you make
is under the spotlight.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,600
Your feelings are no longer
just between two people.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
You have so much to consider.

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,550
How is it not between us?

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,400
If you want to leave today,

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
I'll publicly announce
our relationship right now.

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,800
Are you crazy?

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,079
I don't care what others
think about this relationship.

69
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,880
I only care about you!

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you understand?

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,100
Where are you going?

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,830
Stop acting like a child.

73
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,440
I am a child.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,320
Let go.

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,960
No.

76
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,390
I won't let go!

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
What do you want to do?

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,280
If you keep
holding on like this,

79
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,300
I won't let go either.

80
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,800
[To Hotel Lobby]

81
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,000
Move aside.

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,850
Do you have to be this angry?

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,210
I've told you,

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,560
Chu Xingyan is no longer

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,060
the Chu Xingyan he used to be.

86
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,610
He's always showing off his love
with that unknown girl on set.

87
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,680
He doesn't care about
your feelings at all.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,320
Shut up.

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Haohao.

90
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,840
Only I truly love you.

91
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,260
If you say the word,

92
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,180
I'll kick him out of the crew

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,610
and get revenge for you.

94
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,170
Don't touch me.

95
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,290
I don't need it.

96
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,620
You think I don't know?

97
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,909
You were behind
that "threesome" video.

98
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,840
No matter how much
I dislike them,

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,980
I would never resort
to such methods.

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,680
And even if

101
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,540
Xingyan doesn't like me,

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,290
I won't accept you.

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,540
You'll never be better
than him in my heart.

104
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,640
Chu Xingyan.

105
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,580
Just wait and see.

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,290
Don't you return to the crew?

107
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,710
Today's scenes have

108
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,680
already been finished.

109
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,770
Itchy.

110
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,620
You want it now?

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,900
Are you capable of
doing it again?

112
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,330
Who are you referring to?

113
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,670
Stop, you still need to film today.

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,140
Be good.

115
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,289
Director Song.

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
Is the work hard?

117
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,990
No.

118
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,430
You talk too much.

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,120
My eyes nearly
go blind editing this.

120
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,960
Would you like a bowl of
delicious chicken soup?

121
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,810
No.

122
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,560
I can handle it.

123
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,260
I can talk less in the future.

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,970
No.

125
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,870
I want you to keep talking to me.

126
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,660
Want a bowl of pig's feet noodles?

127
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,480
Le.

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
You're coming!

129
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Director.

130
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,820
What's wrong?

131
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,220
Let me speak first.

132
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,960
The major investor
has made a request.

133
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,020
They want to
adjust your screen time.

134
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,210
Adjust?

135
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,310
What do you mean?

136
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,100
Well, Xingyan.

137
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,790
The investor wanted to

138
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,860
rearrange the scenes
between you and Jiang Feng.

139
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,240
There may be some changes in the ranking.

140
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,570
From now on,
he's the male lead,

141
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,590
and you're the second male lead.

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,600
How is that possible?

143
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,370
We already signed the contract, Le.

144
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm the male lead.

145
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,590
Right now, things are complicated.

146
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,000
The investor has always
appreciated Jiang Feng,

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,640
and that's why we initially decided

148
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,770
he'd play the second male lead.

149
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,030
But now,

150
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,450
he's

151
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,070
the investor's boyfriend.

152
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
So the investor strongly requests that

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,080
Jiang Feng becomes the male lead.

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,540
There's nothing we can do.

155
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,640
What do they think this movie is?

156
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,680
Is it a joke?

157
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,320
A movie is just a show.

158
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,280
A show is fake.

159
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,760
It's meant to deceive people.

160
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,080
Then what's real?

161
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
What's real is finishing the movie.

162
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,310
What about all the scenes
we've already shot?

163
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,480
What about all the staff's hard work?

164
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,020
All wasted?

165
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,060
We're helpless.

166
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,660
We can only cut and reshoot.

167
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,580
I'm sorry, Xingyan.

168
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,550
I've fought for you

169
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,570
as much as I could.

170
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,320
But the investor's attitude is too firm.

171
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
I don't have any room to maneuver.

172
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm sorry.
