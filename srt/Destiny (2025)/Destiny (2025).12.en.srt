Wow, why is he here?

4
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,450
I came to ask about
tomorrow’s shooting schedule.

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,430
Since you’re in charge of
my exclusive documentary,

6
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,250
I need to make a plan
with you in advance.

7
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,010
Mind if I sit?

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,620
Sure.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,710
Sure.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,600
He is Chu Xingyan.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,000
Song Ruan is really
working with a superstar.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
That's impressive.

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,870
What now?

14
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,450
So you're Chu Xingyan.

15
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,380
This is your ex-boyfriend, right?

16
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,250
Wait.

for Song Ruan.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,380
You're quite timid.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
What's wrong?

22
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,950
Can you go back

They're really working together.

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,530

He's not that kind of person.

I've looked for the hallway surveillance footage
from that night.

93

But the hotel only keeps it for 3 months.

That night’s surveillance footage
got overwritten a few days ago.

Even the brand he endorsed

Impossible.
