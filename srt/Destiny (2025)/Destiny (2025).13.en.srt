[Episode 13]

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,400
The movie is about to start filming.

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
How could such a scandal break out now?

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,840
Ms. Le,

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
the video was maliciously edited.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,430
Xingyan is really being framed.

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,360
Le,

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,160
we've known each other for so many years.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,280
You should know

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,720
that I've never done anything

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,760
against my conscience or professional ethics.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,720
This time, someone is really plotting behind the scenes.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,960
I'm a businesswoman.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,200
I don't care if this video is real or fake.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,040
What I care about is my return on investment.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,050
To me, you are an exceptionally high-quality product.

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,920
If one day

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,940
your value depreciates,

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,700
whether it's your fault or not,

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,900
the whole world will demand I abandon you.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,200
Right now, the investors are all on the fence,

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,190
intentionally delaying the project's progress.

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,990
I'll pause the movie for a while.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,920
Ms. Le,

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,620
I understand the difficulties here.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,170
We're willing to lower our fees

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,480
to buy some time.

29
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,840
Don't take the gossip or rumors

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,240
in this industry too seriously.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,620
As long as the PR handles it well,

32
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,120
the public will forget.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,440
In the worst-case scenario,

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
we can go develop our career abroad.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,770
Don't stress too much.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,770
How about we go out for a few drinks?

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,160
I remember whenever you're in a bad mood,

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,330
you always ask me to go to our usual spot.

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,990
Today, I need some time alone.

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,720
Why are you here?

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,460
I wanted to be closer to you.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How long have you been sitting here?

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,200
Don't blame yourself over temporary difficulties.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,760
And don't punish yourself.

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,570
You think it's my fault too?

46
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,610
Yes.

47
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,210
Your fault is

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,980
showing up at my front door

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,970
and sitting on my bench.

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,640
If you do this again, I'll have to charge you.

51
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,410
For someone like you,

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,200
I should charge extra

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,930
so I can make a big profit.

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,240
You really missed your calling by not going into business.

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Also...

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,310
Your fault is

57
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,260
that last night...

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,430
y-you said so many strange things,

59
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,610
making me overthink all night,

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,400
yet today, you didn't answer your phone

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,880
or reply to my messages.

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,240
You're really fickle

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
and moody.

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,510
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,170
What's with that video?

66
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,920
Those two female models

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,680
really did just go to my room

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,209
to look for cosmetics.

69
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,760
The latter part of the video

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,280
was maliciously edited.

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,020
I believe you.

72
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,610
Why?

73
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,040
Didn't you...

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,880
Because during this period of filming,

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,440
I've seen the real you behind the camera.

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,860
You're professional, hardworking,

77
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,480
resilient, and treat people equally.

78
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,700
I want to share all your shining qualities with the world.

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,880
If you won't say it yourself,

80
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,990
I'll let my camera speak for you.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
But if I

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
can't clear this up

83
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,240
and I fall from grace and lose everything,

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,480
will you still stand by me?

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Then, let's say...

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,240
if I were facing the same problem as you're now,

87
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,910
and you were the only one who knew the truth,

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
would you still stand by me?

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,300
The fact that I'm sitting here...

90
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
means I would.

127
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
why didn't you tell me

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,660
that you have a new boyfriend?

129
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,500
This young man is so good-looking.

130
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,460
But why does he look so familiar?

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,300
He looks like some celebrity.

ugly people come in all shapes and sizes,

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
but handsome guys all look similar.

137
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,690
It's normal for a handsome guy
to look like a celebrity, right?

138
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,350
How old are you this year?

139
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,570
I'm 26, born in the Year of the Tiger.

140
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,260
People born in the Year of the Tiger tend to be stubborn.

two months.

148
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,250
Yes, I have.

149
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,120
So, how many girlfriends did you have
before dating my daughter?

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,800
Dad.

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,730
Hard to say, huh?

152
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,460
Do you like drinking?

153
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,280
Occ-occasionally, for business socializing.

154
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,470
Ever drunk with her?

155
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,330
Dad.

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,690
Have you or haven't you?

157
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
We've had a few drinks.

158
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,510
Had a few drinks?

159
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,440
You must have some intentions, right?

160
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
No, not really.

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,880
N-No other intentions.

162
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,030
You don't seem very honest.

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,300
You like my daughter but have no other intentions?

164
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
How is that possible?

165
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,330
What intentions do you think he has, Dad?

166
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,980
Are you two colleagues?

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
I suppose so.

168
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,890
How much do you earn in a month?

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
Quite a lot.

170
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Over 30,000 yuan?

171
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
More than that.

172
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,290
Looks like you're a high earner.

173
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,750
Then what's there to be shy about?

174
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,970
Five million yuan.

175
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,960
What?

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,700
Per month?

177
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,280
You work for someone

178
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,799
and earn five million yuan a month?

179
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,000
Sometimes...

180
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,610
10 million yuan.

181
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,610
S-Side gigs earn me more.

182
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,740
Oh.

183
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,020
Does she know how much you earn per month?

184
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
She...

185
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,090
Just found out.

186
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,110
Just found out?

187
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,710
Dad.

188
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,300
No, no...

189
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,430
Young man, don't be so hasty.

190
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,660
Oh, Song,

191
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,760
the TV show is about to start.

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,160
Let's go, let's go back inside to watch TV.

193
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
You two keep chatting.

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,880
Let's go.

195
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,110
I told you not to come, didn't I?

196
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,480
But you insisted.

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,280
Your dad was also born in the Year of the Tiger, right?

198
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,740
Not easy to get along with.

199
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,090
You noticed that?

200
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,880
Have some watermelon.

201
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,360
Is it good?

202
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
It's homegrown. What do you think?

203
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,640
Mm,

204
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,960
sweet.

205
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,250
The high and mighty superstar

206
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,100
actually appeared in my little courtyard.

207
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,040
And tonight you'll even be sleeping

208
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,460
in my guest room.

209
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,270
Sitting here with me, eating watermelon.

210
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,710
It's kinda so surreal.

211
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,770
You're exaggerating.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,870
We're all just...

213
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,070
ordinary people.

214
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Then how do you, an ordinary person,

215
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,140
dare to come to such a remote place with me?

216
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,650
Aren't you afraid... I might have some ulterior motives

217
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,850
and kidnap you?

218
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,430
If it's you, go ahead and kidnap me.

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Maybe...

220
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,560
I'd be the lucky one.

221
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,750
Chu Xingyan.

222
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,140
Eat your watermelon.

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
I'm into you.
