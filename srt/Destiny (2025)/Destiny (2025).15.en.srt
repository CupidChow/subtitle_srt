00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,330
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,390
Sometimes passionate,

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,890
and sometimes cold.

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,760
But he was the one who always took the initiative before.

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,850
His gaze and words made me blush.

7
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,290
What do you think is going on in his mind?

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,080
But why,

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,440
when I'm ready to start a relationship,

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,350
he seems like a completely different person?

11
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,610
How can you let a man make you so restless?

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,300
Men are like kites.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,650
The string is in your hand.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,379
The key is learning how to control it skillfully.

15
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,040
I wish I could,

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,320
but I can't figure him out.

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,470
Does it matter if his feelings for you are real or not?

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,560
What matters is

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,440
you need to figure out

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,370
whether you really like him or not.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,640
I do like him,

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
but...

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,750
I feel like he rejected me.

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,230
How could you speak up first?

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,220
Men are like cats.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,289
The more you chase him, the more he runs.

27
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,039
If you don't chase him,

28
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,970
he'll come to you out of curiosity.

29
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,560
So what should I do?

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,250
Wait patiently?

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,600
Cut it off.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,300
Don't contact him for now.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,610
Let me tell you,

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,520
if he gets cold,

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,759
you get even colder.

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
If he wants to contact you,

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
just ignore him.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Everyone has a little temper, you know.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,360
How dare you come to such a remote place with me?

40
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,780
Aren't you afraid

41
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,680
I might have some bad intentions

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
and kidnap you?

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,320
If it's you, go ahead and kidnap me.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,420
Maybe

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,650
I'd be the one who gains from it.

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,410
The fact that I'm sitting here

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,620
means I'm willing.

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
I like you.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Should we

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,770

Chu Xingyan,

72
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,890
are you...

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,190
asleep?

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,450
The power is out.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,490
I don't know what went wrong.

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,700
Power's out?

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
Song Ruan.

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,909
Well,

79
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,430
you said your power was out,

80
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,750
so I thought I'd come check on you.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,840
But I see all the surrounding areas have power.

82
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,640
It's only your place that's out.

83
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,010
It must be a short circuit somewhere.

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,350
I don't know.

85
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,740
I've already told the hotel,

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,630
and they've called for an electrician.

87
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,870
Why call an electrician?

88
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,950
Isn't there one right here?

89
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,360
These electrical issues

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
are a piece of cake for me.

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,500
In our house,

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,880
all the electrical problems

93
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
are solved by me.

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,640
Alright,

95
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,590
just pull this up and it'll be fine.

96
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,790
Master Song.

97
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,070
There must be a short circuit somewhere else.

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,620
Let me check again.

99
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,470
It's okay.

100
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,620
You're not a real electrician anyway.

101
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,440
If we don't eat soon, it'll melt.

102
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,430
Chu Xingyan,

103
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,170
what are you afraid of?

104
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,220
I don't know either.

105
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,900
Maybe

106
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,720
I don't really want to be...

107
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,410
in a relationship.

108
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,820
I don't really understand myself either.

109
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,250
When you persuaded me before,

110
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,880
I remember everything you said.

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,350
You didn't say this.

112
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,000
How come I'm standing in front of you now,

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,570
and you're telling me you don't really understand yourself?

114
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,380
You're not even willing

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,240
to give it a try?

116
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,110
Not everything can be achieved by trying.

117
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,080
Like the power outage today,

118
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,370
you tried to fix the circuit,

119
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
but what difference did it make?

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
You're still in the dark now, aren't you?

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,480
Can you say you didn't try?

122
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,010
What if I say

123
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,080
I can make all the lights in this room

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,159
turn on?

125
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,190
How is that possible?

126
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,030
You really can.

127
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,910
This is just a very common case of overheated wiring,

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,570
a tripped circuit breaker.

129
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,380
Then

130
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,620
why didn't you turn on the lights earlier?

131
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,820
I wanted you to be in the dark for a while.

132
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,760
Chu Xingyan,

133
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,960
I want to tell you that

134
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,940
there's a kind of difficulty

135
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,640
you think requires to overcome

136
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,200
so many challenges,

137
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
but it's actually just a moment.

138
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,610
It's also in this moment

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,230
that I realized something.

140
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,890
You made me fall for you,

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,420
and gave me

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,590
the courage to open my heart to you

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,780
and get close to you.

144
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,170
After falling for you,

145
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,750
I took the first step forward.

146
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,630
What about you?

147
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,110
Why are you not even as brave as a girl like me?

148
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,970
Chu Xingyan,

149
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,280
let's face this matter head-on,

150
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,820
okay?

151
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
