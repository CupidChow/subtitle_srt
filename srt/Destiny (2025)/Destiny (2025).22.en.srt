[Episode 22]

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,870
In my opinion,

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,880
a good performance

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,560
is definitely one that leaves a lasting impression on the audience,

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,840
one that makes them empathize.

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,080
I once acted in a scene

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,590
where the female lead was about to die from an illness,

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,080
[The World of Performance by Chu Xingyan

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
and the male lead had to write a poem for her.

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,240
When I performed this scene,

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,840
I was completely immersed in the character,

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,290
writing the poem while crying.

Even after we finished filming,

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,200
whenever I recalled that scene,

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,800
I felt very sad,

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,860
very heartbroken.

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,270
Later, the audience said...

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,370
Don't worry about what happens in front of the camera.

21
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,360
That's what the role requires.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
It's acting, it's not real, you understand?

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
He's so passionate about acting,

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
I shouldn't have doubted him.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,120
Honey,

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
honey, you're in the news.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,920

[Chu Xingyan caught cheating with young assistant in photo studio. The HaoYan couple ended tragically.]

34
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,850
Who is Song Ruan? This is so disappointing!

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,520
My sister is so much prettier than that other woman!

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,120
Is Chu Xingyan blind?

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,479
Chu Xingyan must have been really craving.

38
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,940
This can't be right.

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,090
You're Chu Xingyan's real girlfriend, aren't you?

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Things have developed like this,

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,930
what do you think we should do?

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,130
I can immediately find a reporter to clarify this matter.

43
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,310
Stop right there.

44
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,440
If you officially announce your relationship with Song Ruan now,

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,340
it won't do our movie any good.

46
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,910
How will the audience view you and Haohao

47
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,400

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,259
How about this?

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,759
I'll call a press conference for the movie now.

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,830
You officially announce your relationship with Haohao,

51
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,520
show some affection in front of everyone,

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,180
let this incident fade away.

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
It will also help promote our movie.

Isn't that good?

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,850
That's impossible, Le.

56
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,530
I've said I won't use relationships for publicity.

57
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,590
Besides, Song Ruan is my girlfriend.

58
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,670
How can I let her suffer this kind of humiliation?

59
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,840
If you officially announce your relationship with Song Ruan now,

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
are you sure she can handle it?

the movie is about to wrap up.

63
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,510
It will be released in six months at most.

64
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,140
Just treat it as if you're acting another scene with Lin Haohao.

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,040
After a year or so,

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,360
you two can announce your breakup.

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,310
Then you can publicly reveal your relationship with Song Ruan.

68
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,440
Isn't that okay?

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,810
I really can't act this out.

70
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,540
But Song Ruan has agreed to it.

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,400
Who's so heartless

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,150
to expose someone's personal information?

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,880
I just got back and saw reporters downstairs.

75

Stay at home for the next few days,

I'll draw some tarot cards for you in a bit,

How could Song Ruan agree to Le to do such a thing?

84

These people have gone crazy.

85
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,730
They're trying to bully me, aren't they?

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
What is this?

You're my girlfriend.

100
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't listen to Le and others' nonsense.

101
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
I won't hype things up with Lin Haohao.

102
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,370
Don't be impulsive.

103
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,980
You love acting so much.

104
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,640
For this movie,

105
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,310
you've put in so much effort.

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,050
I don't want to ruin everything because of me.

107
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm fine.

108
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,250
I'm just a nobody.

109
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,840
The netizens will forget about me in a few days.

110
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm willing to cooperate with the production team's decision.

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
You looked so upset watching me

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,590
act opposite Lin Haohao,

113
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,270
would you be cool with us faking a couple?

114
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,300
I don't care.

115
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,190
No.

116

when you made a personal documentary for Chu Xingyan,

147
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,800
did you have other motives for getting close to him?

148
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
What exactly were your intentions?

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920

what is your relationship

is my girlfriend.

Ah?

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,310
Ah?

Please share something, Chu Xingyan.

Can you give a direct response?
