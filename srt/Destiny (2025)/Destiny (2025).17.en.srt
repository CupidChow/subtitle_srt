I just... want some water.

You'll cook for me?

Okay.

28
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,950
But... I only know how to make instant noodles.

29
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,030
Instant noodles are fine.

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,000
But I don't usually cook noodles for free.

31
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,520
I charge a lot.

32
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,050
Then...

33
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,890
can I pay with this?

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560

Let me put it on you.

38
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,600

Mm-hmm.

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,070
I suppose it counts as thoughtful.

indiscretion.

Also, forgive my hesitation and for backing away before.

51
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,260
I might be... a bit slow on the uptake,

52
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,640
and I'm not all that quick.

53
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I've only just realized that...

54
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,850
you're the one who can bring me back to the past

Song Ruan,

73
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,560
what kind of stuff have you shot?

74
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
There's no juicy content at all!

75
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,920
Now, his threesome video

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
is spreading everywhere.

77
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
The audience wants to see his private life.

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,320
The more scandalous, the better.

79
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,270
Don't you get that?

80
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,330
Mr. Cui,

81
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,720
I won't film the kind of material you want.

82
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
You can find someone else.

83
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,810
This isn't up to you.

84
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,310
I'm warning you,

85
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,020
if you can't deliver the materials I want,

86
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,600
I will truthfully fill out your internship report

87
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,160
about your non-cooperation and lack of results.

88
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,360
Without this internship report,

89
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,000
you might not even get your diploma, right?

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,760
But Chu Xingyan

91
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,640
never did

92
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,840
the thing you're talking about.

93
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,480
I can't just fabricate fake stories

94
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,260
to frame him, can I?

95
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,600
This would have a very negative impact

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,880
on his career.

97
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
Is a disgraced womanizer really worth you doing all this?

98
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,400
He's not!

99
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,440
I will definitely find evidence

100
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,380
to prove Chu Xingyan's innocence.

101
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,500
Song Ruan!

102
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,570
Are you interested in making a deal with me?

103
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,700
A deal?

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,060
You're in charge of sorting the materials

105
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,650
for the documentary about Chu Xingyan, right?

106
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,960
I want to buy it outright.

107
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Name your price.

108
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Not for sale.

109
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,550
What are you doing?

110
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,850
Name your price.

111
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,900
Whatever Chu Xingyan can offer you,

112
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,430
I, Jiang Feng, can match it.

113
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,620
And even more.

114
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,350
Please keep your distance.

115
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,240
If you come any closer, I'll call for help!

116
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,350
How ungrateful.

117
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,370
You think he really cares about you?

118
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,560
He's just using you as a pawn

119
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,890
to piss off his high-and-mighty mother.

120
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,710
He's not that kind of person.

121
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,820
On the contrary, you, Jiang Feng,

122
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,350
using fake news to sabotage your rival.

123
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
Your methods

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,940
are far from honorable.

125
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,810
You defend him so much...

126
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,420
Do you really think he'll be grateful?

127
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,630
Don't be so naive.

128
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
Don't think that working by his side

129
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,550
gives you a chance to be with him.

130
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,480
Just a few days ago,

131
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,340
he publicly admitted to the media

132
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,400
that he already has someone he likes.

133
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,400
You're just an ordinary intern.

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,100
Don't dream of punching above your weight.

135
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,140
Miss Song,

136
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,090
knowing when to separate work from personal feelings

137
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,570
is what's best for you.

138
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,720
Whatever is between him and me is none of your business.

139
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,380
Don't be so quick to refuse me.

140
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,140
If you agree to my terms,

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,220
I can give you a million yuan upfront.

142
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,190
How about that?

143
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,400
Sell the video to me

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,490
and make some real money,

145
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,790
so you won't end up...

146
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,200
with nothing.

147
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,390
I'd lose everything if I were to listen to you.

148
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,570
Be careful, or I'll report you online!

149
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,720
How ungrateful.

150
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,970
Let's go eat.

151
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,510
Come here.

152
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,160
These past couple of days,

153
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
I've been digging into

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,520
the social media accounts of those two models.

155
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,840
I finally found

156
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,500
a private Instagram account.

157
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,050
That's impressive.

158
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,430
Of course.

159
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,320
When it comes to tracking down private accounts,

160
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,050
every woman is a detective.

162
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,840
Didn't this scene

163
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,270
appear in your MV?

164
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,690
That was my suite.

165
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,600
They clearly went there at night.

166
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
How could they be taking photos during the day?

167
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,180
Look at the timestamp on this post.

168
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,280
[Enjoying a wonderful time. Be happy today too. Those who have seen flowers bloom
will understand the gentleness of the wind.]

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,160
This should've been taken after your MV shoot, right?

170
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,660
Is there a possibility

171
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,600
that after you checked out,

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,460
they checked into the same suite?

173
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,330
Look at the posted date.

174
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,940
It'll be three months in two days.

175
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,550
Two days...

176
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,170
