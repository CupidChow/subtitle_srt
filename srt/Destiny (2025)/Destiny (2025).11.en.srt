[Episode 11]

3
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,520
Good, very good.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,980
Very nice, very handsome.

5
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,120
Good, lift your chin a bit more.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,850
A little higher. Okay.

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm done.

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,310
Xingyan, please take a break for now.

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,680
Li, push the big light over.

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,610
Alright, got it.

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,700
Here, the light's coming.

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,600
Just put it here.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
Okay.

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,360
Hello, Director.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,039
I'm sorry about that.

16
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,450
I'm late.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,940
There was a bit of traffic.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
I thought you weren't coming.

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,350
Didn't we have a scheduled shoot today?

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Why wouldn't I come?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,980
I always keep work and personal life separate.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,780
Thought you might feel awkward.

23
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,780
Why would I be awkward?

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,070
Awkward about seeing me.

25
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,220
I'm a professional, okay?

[Ji Fanxi]

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,340
Hello?

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,130
Graduation reunion?

29
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,630
Forget it.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,979
I'm not going.

31
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,070
You go by yourself.

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,670
Why aren't you going?

33
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,570
Why are you eavesdropping on my call?

34
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,440
Eavesdropping?

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,639
What eavesdropping?

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
We're sitting so close. Why would I need to eavesdrop?

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,560
So why aren't you going?

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
There's someone I don't want to see.

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,310
I don't know exactly what happened.

40
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,780
But I think,

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,690
avoiding it definitely won't solve the problem.

42
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,480
Sometimes, the more you avoid it,

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,740
the more they'll think

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,400
that you really care.

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,360
So you have to learn to face things.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,520
Only by truly facing it

47
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,180
can you truly let go.

48
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,470
It's not as simple as you think.

49
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,820
Still not over

50
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,550
your ex-boyfriend?

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,310
Stop gossiping.

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,040
HaoYan couple finally cooperated again after three years.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,280
And the movie's even called "Back in Time to Love You."

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
This isn't just a movie announcement.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,120
It's practically a relationship announcement.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Ah, it's killing me.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
My couple is reuniting.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,050
Chu Xingyan,

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
do you think you've won?

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
The real climax

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,200
of this drama is yet to come.

62
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,210
She still hasn't come.

63
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,090
Not even replying to my messages.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Is everyone here?

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,720
Then let's begin.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,380
Let's go through it from the first scene.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,880
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
I've decided to attend the graduation reunion after all.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,300
I won't be able to make it to today's script reading.

70
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,570
So you have to learn to face things.

71
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,720
Only by truly facing it

72
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,480
can you truly let go.

73
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,750
It's not as simple as you think.

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,440
Still not over your ex-boyfriend?

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Junior,

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
long time no see.

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,380
You've become even prettier.

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,430
Senior,

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,930
long time no see.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,000
Why are you even more handsome than before?

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Really?

82
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,250
Can I get a little closer to you?

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Can I get a little closer to you?

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,190
Of course.

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
It's fake.

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,780
Baby,

87
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,580
ever since we broke up,

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,230
I've been thinking of you every moment.

89
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,840
I truly know I was wrong.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's get back together.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,850
I promise I'll treat you well.

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
Okay?

93
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,480
Let go!

94
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,850
Xingyan.

95
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,010
The script is really well-written.

96
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,730
I got into character.

97
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,320
Let's continue.

98
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,810
Let's watch the second episode.

99
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,710
I really didn't expect you two to end up together.

100
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,680
You have no idea.

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
Back then, to pursue her,

102
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,560
I would buy her breakfast

103
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
and take her to class,

104
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,340
like her personal assistant.

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,159
Well, you managed to win me over, didn't you?

106
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,400
Oh, come on, stop showing off your love.

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,080
Think about

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
us singles.

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,760
Why didn't you get a boyfriend back in college?

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Hey, come here.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,060
I heard the TA is dating our class beauty.

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,500
Is that true?

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I thought the TA was closer to Song Ruan.

114
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,740
Really?

115
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Ruan, didn't you say you weren't coming?

116
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
I've thought it through.

117
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,960
Avoiding it isn't the solution.

118
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
The more I hide,

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,200
the more some people might think I care.

120
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
You've finally thought it through.

121
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,800
Cheers.

122
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,600
Ji Fanxi, Song Ruan,

123
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,780
what are you two whispering about?

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Nothing.

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,850
How about we play Truth or Dare?

126
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,680
Sure.

127
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,750
Great.

128
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,640
Great.

129
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
Let's spin the bottle.

130
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,750
Okay.

131
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,200
Let me spin it.

132
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,600
Song Ruan.

133
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,390
I have a question.

134
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,460
Song Ruan,

135
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
I've heard rumors

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,040
that you're working with that big star, Chu Xingyan.

137
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,760
Is it true?

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,650
Chu Xingyan?

139
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes.

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,560
So, that celebrity,

141
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,180
is he really like what they say online,

142
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,000
living a chaotic life,

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,630
surrounded by beauties?

144
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,530
Any inside gossip?

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,050
It's not that exaggerated.

146
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,590
He's pretty much like us ordinary people.

147
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,520
Sometimes he might even have more troubles.

148
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,920
That's too pretentious, isn't it?

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,520
With all the money they make,

150
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,960
these little troubles are nothing.

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,730
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

152
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,880
Are you two still together?

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,260
Not anymore.

154
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,600
Some people shouldn't be so presumptuous, okay?

155
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,640
Song Ruan

156
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,630
is now with a super star every day.

157
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,140
Who would still care about some past guy?

158
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,700
Really?

159
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,840
Song Ruan, are you in a relationship?

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,330
No, no, it's not like that.

161
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,940
Don't listen to her nonsense.

162
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,270
I'm just filming a personal documentary.

163
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,520
It's still being

164
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
with a super star though.

165
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
There, that's him.

166
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,640
Chu Xingyan.

167
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,800
I can assure you,

168
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,740
she's really filming a documentary with a big star.

169
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,210
It's okay.

170
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,530
Chu Xingyan.

171
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Is it true?

172
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,220
It's true.

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
What you just said is true?

174
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,169
I don't know if it's true or not.

175
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Song Ruan,

176
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,200
I know you want to prove that you're doing well now,

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,210
but,

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,450
there's really no need

179
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,470
to lie to satisfy your vanity, right?

180
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,860
I'm not lying.

181
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,290
So you were just bragging.

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I'm not bragging.

183
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,800
It's true.

184
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,860
I really like him.

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
I want to see his photo.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,950
I usually just film the daily routine for the documentary.

187
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,500
I don't take photos.

188
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,600
Why don't you call him

189
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,190
and let us hear his voice?

190
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,320
He's working tonight,

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,050
and I don't want to disturb him.

192
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,260
Alright, alright.

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
Stop pressuring her.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,160
Let's eat first.

195
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,150
Okay.

196
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,930
Cheers, have a good time.

197
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,680
Alright.

198
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,930
Song Ruan.

199
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,410
After graduation, you still need to work steadily.

200
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,830
Don't always be so fanciful.

201
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,960
Song Ruan.

202
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,920
Who is it?

203
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Do you know him?

204
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,030
Why are you here?

205
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,200
You stood me up, didn't you?

206
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,040
I came specially to ask about tomorrow's filming plan.

207
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,880
After all, you're in charge of my exclusive personal documentary.

208
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,710
I need to schedule time with you in advance.
