[Destiny]

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,380
[Episode 14]

3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,160
I like you.

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,680
Should we

5
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,870
be together...

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,210
And be boyfriend and girlfriend?

7
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Xingyan.

8
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,570
I have good news for you.

9
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,020
I was chosen by the production team.

10
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,940
Really?

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,400
I knew you'd make it.

12
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,430
Even though it's just a small supporting role,

13
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,450
I'll definitely do my best

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,700
to play this character well.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,039
This is just the beginning.

16
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,020
There will be better and bigger roles waiting for you in the future.

17
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,539
Yes.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,440
Thank you for introducing

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,890
such a good opportunity to me.

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,960
Don't say that.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,530
Let's go celebrate.

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,930
What do you want to eat?

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,140
I want to eat...

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,030
Fried chicken.

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't cry.

26
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,160
They said

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,039
I'm only fit to be an extra on set.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,260
I can't get any good roles at all.

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,070
They even said I'm throwing myself at you

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,070
and that I'm not good enough for you.

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,430
Don't listen to what they say.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
Let's take it step by step,

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,900
steadily and surely.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,980
Now is the time to build a foundation.

35
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,890
You're so young, there will be
plenty of opportunities in the future.

36
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,840
Besides, whether you're good enough or not

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,240
isn't for them to decide.

38
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,470
I'll definitely prove them wrong.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,910
You look beautiful today.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,480
When do I not look good?

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,130
You look good every day.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,480
What's wrong?

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
Xingyan,

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,750
you go to the cafeteria first.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,010
I have something to do.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,880
What is it? Do you want me to come with you?

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,480
No need.

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
My roommate Hui isn't feeling well.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,460
I want to go back and check on her first.

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,530
Then you should go quickly.

51
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,410
Text me later.

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,060
Okay.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
Chu Xingyan,

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000
Haohao

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,310
isn't with you?

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,960
She

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,180
just left.

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,550
You...

59
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,950
Aren't you feeling unwell?

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,670
Huh?

61
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,770
No, I'm not.

62
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,920
Who said that?

63
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,920
Maybe I heard wrong.

64
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,020
It's okay.

Do you know you might not get your diploma this way?

82
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,630
A diploma is just a piece of paper.

83
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,020
In our circle,

84
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,070
who cares about degrees?

85
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,440
But that's our school's graduation performance.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,850
We've been rehearsing together for a long time.

87
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,180
I want to, too.

88
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,800
You haven't even graduated yet,

89
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,910
and you're already the center of everyone's attention.

90
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,100
And me?

91
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,270
They just refer to me as your girlfriend.

92
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't want to be an accessory.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,280
One day, when people talk about me, I want them to say,

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
“That's Lin Haohao,”

95
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,380
not “Chu Xingyan's girlfriend.”

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Why didn't you tell me about these thoughts earlier?

97
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,500
Why should I have to say it?

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,870
Today, I landed a lead role.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,740
I used my own way

100
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,580
to earn a place that matters.

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,890
I know.

102
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,880
It's that Mr. Liu who's always

103
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,420
getting handsy with you.

104
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,060
What I see is an opportunity.

105
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,120
Why would you be jealous about that?

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Do you know what you're doing?

107
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,400
Of course I do.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,060
What about our relationship?

109
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Feelings are like that diploma.

110
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,090
No one cares about them.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
In this world,

112
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,940
except for your mother,

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,370
no woman will love you purely.

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
Let's break up.

115
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,800
Chu Xingyan!

116
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,090
You just can't stand to see me doing well.

117
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,550
Remember this,

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,220
it's not you dumping me today.

119
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,200
It's me getting better

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,659
and choosing to leave you.

121
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,190
♪ Time moves too fast ♪

122
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,330
♪ I've always learned to let go ♪

123
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,909
♪ If you find the right love ♪

124
00:06:51,540 --> 00:07:01,040
♪ I'll quickly learn to lose myself in the crowd again ♪

125
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,860
Chu Xingyan,

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
so what do you want?

127
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm sorry,

128
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,350
I have to deal with my business first.

129
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,680
Chu Xingyan.

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,790
Chu Xingyan!

131
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,570
Chu Xingyan!

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,760
Chu Xingyan!

133
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,159
Chu Xingyan!

134
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,720
Chu Xingyan!

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,380
Is the video circulating online real?

136
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,800
What's your relationship

137
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,280
with the two women in the video?

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,720
Chu Xingyan.

139
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,450
Chu Xingyan.

140
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,760
Say something.

141
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,620
Say something.

142
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,260
Yes, please tell us.

143
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,340
Tell us.

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
Is the production delay

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
due to the impact of this video?

146
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
Regarding the incident related to the video,

147
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,000
relevant authorities are investigating.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Once the investigation is complete,

149
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
we will provide a clear response to everyone.

150
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,970
What do you mean?

151
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,560
We are still investigating the incident.

152
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,760
We will give everyone a clear answer after the investigation.

153
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
Please leave for now.

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,110
Are you just brushing us off?

155
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,000
This is all over the internet now.

156
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,060
Can you say a bit more?

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Chu Xingyan, are they dropping you from the lead role?

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,970
Chu Xingyan.

159
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
Will this video lead you to lose your lead role?

160
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,060
Is this the hotel management?

161
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,860
There are many reporters gathered outside Chu Xingyan's building,

162
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,320
severely affecting Mr. Chu's normal life.

163
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,620
For such a big brand like yours,

164
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,530
to have such a major leak

165
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,060
in terms of privacy issues.

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm giving you ten minutes to resolve this.

167
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,960
Xingyan,

168
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,290
where have you been?

169
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Do you know how worried I've been?

170
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,470
I went out for a walk.

171
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,720
Reporters have been watching you lately.

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,890
It's too dangerous for you to go out alone.

173
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,960
I understand you're not in a good mood

174
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,820
and it's normal to want to go out for a walk.

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,080
But next time, could you let me know in advance?

176
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,860
So I can be prepared for any emergencies.

177
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,460
It won't happen again.

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm not blaming you.

180
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm just worried about you.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,010
I know.

182
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm fine.

183
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Xingyan,

184
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,210
I said

185
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,690
I'm worried about you.

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
Can you understand what I mean?

187
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,530
So where did you go last night?

188
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,800
I went to Song Ruan's house.

189
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,250
Song Ruan again?

190
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
Do you like her?

191
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,840
How can you like her?

192
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,940
I've known you for three years.

193
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,460
I've always been there for you, no matter what.

194
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,330
How long have you known her?

195
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,370
She's just an ordinary person.

196
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,390
What's wrong with you?

197
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,250
Don't you really understand?

198
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Don't you understand my feelings even now?

199
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,780
Chu Xingyan,

200
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
I like you.

201
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,040
I've given up many opportunities over the years,

202
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,340
wholeheartedly staying by your side,

203
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,380
hoping

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,990
that when you've had enough of fleeting romances,

205
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,720
you'd turn back and notice my constant presence.

206
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,260
You'd realize

207
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
that only I understand you the most,

208
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
and love you the most.

209
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,920
Zhu Yan,

210
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,480
I've always seen you as

211
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,560
my best partner.

212
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,160
But I'm also a woman.

213
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,630
I long to be loved,

214
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,060
I long for the person I like to see me.

215
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,500
I long for a more intimate and trusting relationship.

216
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,800
Zhu Yan,

217
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
but you're already the person I trust the most.

218
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,560
You know

219
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,400
it's hard for me to...

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,900
Then why is it okay with Song Ruan?

221
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,020
She's different.

222
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,370
She's...

223
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,800
Someone I can show

224
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,480
everything to.

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm so close to you,

226
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,350
yet you're looking so far away.

227
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,740
I'll only ask this once:

228
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,560
Can we

229
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,320
be together?

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,460
Zhu Yan,

231
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,010
liking someone is a very complicated thing.

232
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,060
I can't explain it either.

233
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,640
I don't even know

234
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,260
what I'm thinking right now.

235
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,220
But I'm certain

236
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,520
that all your efforts over these years,

237
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,280
all these little things,

238
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,290
I remember them all in my heart.

239
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,770
Without you,

240
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
I definitely couldn't have reached where I am now.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm very grateful to you,

242
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,190
but gratitude

243
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,080
doesn't equal love.

244
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,430
I've been too blunt.

245
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,080
I really don't want you to misunderstand.
