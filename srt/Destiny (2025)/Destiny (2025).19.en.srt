00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,430
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,240
I am a slow person,

4
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,910
but I'll walk towards you

5
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,020
step by step,

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,600
slow yet fast, to be with you.

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,010
Okay, cut!

8
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,510
Xingyan, come here for a moment.

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,880
Xingyan,

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,580
your performance today seems off.

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm sorry, Director.

12
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,640
You're not fully immersed in the role.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
Think it over, okay?

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Alright.

15
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,270
By the way, Xingyan,

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,410
this kissing scene is very important.

17
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,490
Think it through.

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,960
Okay?

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,400
Okay.

20
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,000
I always thought

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,590
that I was indispensable.

22
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,270
But in Xingyan's eyes,

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,640
you're clearly more important than me.

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,860
Actually, Xingyan values you too.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,330
It's different.

26
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,440
You're affecting Chu Xingyan.

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,150
Your presence here

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,560
is distracting him.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,680
Slow yet fast, to be with you.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,980
Cut!

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Your performance today seems off.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,780
I never thought it would be like this.

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,290
He needs to focus on his work now.

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,560
We've got enough footage for the documentary.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,540
I think it's time to wrap it up.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
I understand.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,340
You've already got more than enough.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
I once imagined

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,700
that one day,

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,210
I could truly become

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,810
the one standing beside Xingyan,

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,760
accompanying him for life.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
I also wondered

44
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,380
if it wasn't me,

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,360
then who would it be?

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
But no matter how many times I thought about it,

47
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,280
I never imagined

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,410
Xingyan would choose

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
a girl like you.

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,130
You...

51
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,360
I don't want to deny

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,760
that you must have some shining qualities.

53
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,450
Since he's chosen you,

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,680
you must have something I don't.

55
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,110
I don't doubt Xingyan's judgment.

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,490
Losing to you,

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,480
I do feel reluctant.

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,730
I devoted all my youth and emotions

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,530
to Xingyan.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
But in the end,

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,220
what I got in return

62
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,579
was just my own struggle and pain.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Miss Zhu,

64
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm very sorry.

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,490
Don't apologize to me.

66
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,340
You did nothing wrong,

67
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,270
and neither did Xingyan.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,810
Love is love,

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
and no love is no love.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
I'll try my best to wish you happiness.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Zhu Yan.

72
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,940
Xingyan.

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,260
I'm planning to go abroad for a while

74
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,730
to study.

75
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,950
You've already decided?

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
You have your dreams,

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,840
and I should go find my own dreams too.

78
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,170
Staying by your side,

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,040
it's hard for me to control my feelings.

80
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,360
Only by leaving can I start anew.

81
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,330
But don't worry,

82
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,720
I've already found

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
an excellent agent for you.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,800
The handover is almost done.

85
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,230
He'll contact you after work today.

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,330
I promise

87
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,910
that the next person

88
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,790
will meet all your requirements.

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,050
You don't need to make any changes

90
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,490
to adapt to the new agent.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
Zhu Yan.

92
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,240
After I leave,

93
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,500
make sure you eat regularly.

94
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,070
Your stomach is weak,

95
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,460
so eat less cold and spicy food.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Drink less alcohol

97
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,409
and more warm water.

98
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't always stay up late.

99
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,940
Even when studying scripts and practicing lines,

100
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,540
don't get so absorbed that you forget the time.

101
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,270
When filming is tough

102
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
and you're working out or losing weight,

103
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,260
make sure you get enough carbs and nutrition

104
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,330
to keep your body's energy up.

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
Also,

106
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,960
I know your ambitions as an actor.

107
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,810
You want to prove yourself.

108
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,070
But sometimes the more eagerly you pursue something,

109
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,930
the more traces it leaves.

110
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,840
The most precious thing about you

111
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,160
is your strong empathy and sensitivity.

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,790
When filming, calm your mind

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
and convey emotions sincerely.

114
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,750
I can see that.

115
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
I'll try my best.

116
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,930
Consider money a bit more important.

117
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,060
Don't be emotional.

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,570
Money is more important than anything.

119
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,590
It gives you the power to choose.

120
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,350
Finally,

121
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,810
no matter...

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
where I go,

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
I always hope

124
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,280
you'll get better and better.

125
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,840
Wish you eternal happiness.

126
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,750
Thank you.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Goodbye.

128
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,049
You're here.

129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,960
Le.

130
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,360
Xingyan,

131
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,179
you don't seem to be in good state lately.

132
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,290
Yeah, I guess.

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,410
As a mature artist,

134
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,700
your abilities

135
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,480
and attitude in your profession

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,100
have never worried me.

137
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,740
What's going on this time?

138
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,720
It's some personal matters

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
which have affected my work.

140
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,790
If it's personal,

141
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,110
I won't ask further.

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
But you need to separate work and private life.

143
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,680
A professional actor

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,210
releases all emotions in front of the camera.

145
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,890
Your performance represents not only you

146
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,310
but also me.

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,080
This is my first time encountering such a situation.

148
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,490
I'll adjust.

149
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,680
As an actor,

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,010
once you're on set,

151
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,240
all emotions and feelings must give way to filming.

152
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,800
You don't need me to teach you

153
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,530
that the show must go on, right?

154
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,730
I understand.

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,170
I still have a lot to learn.

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,050
Quickly get back to your best.

157
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,530
If this continues for long

158
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,150
and certain rumors spread,

159
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,590
it will affect your future development.

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
I understand.

161
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,240
Have some coffee to reduce the swelling.

162
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,350
It's my first time in this city,

163
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,770
[Following][Recommendation]

164
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,450
and I can already feel its warmth.

165
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,530
It's very fitting for our movie's theme,

166
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,370
"Back in Time to Love You."

167
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,650
I believe if we could really go back in time,

168
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,800
[Following][Recommendation]

169
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,480
this city would be full of beautiful memories.

170
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,580
I hope when the movie is released,

171
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,040
it will live up to everyone's expectations.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,280
Your presence here

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,830
is distracting him.

174
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,440
We've got enough footage for the documentary.

175
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,240
