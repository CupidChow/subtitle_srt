[Episode 10]

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,980
Song Ruan, Song Ruan.

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,720
You can only handle this little amount of alcohol.

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,380
Why are you trying to show off?

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,120
You haven't really developed those kinds of feelings for him, have you?

7
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,510
Wake up, Song Ruan.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,880
You need to have some self-awareness.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,760
What if he's just a good actor?

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,690
What if he's sincere?

11
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,410
Song Ruan, he's an actor.

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,890
It's not hard for him to act like he likes you.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,230
Song Ruan.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,010
You're not one of those girls who can be easily fooled

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,700
by sweet talk.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,180
You're the only one in my life.

17
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,410
If I had to trade the whole world for you,

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,590
I would.

19
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,510
Song Ruan, wake up.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,759
Who are you talking to?

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,860
I'm thinking about our shooting content for today.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,880
Are you feeling alright?

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,590
You were pretty drunk yesterday.

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,560
You actually...

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,830
I blacked out.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't remember what happened after.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,560
Are you trying to deny it?

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,790
I really don't remember.

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Then why did you say to me...

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
Don't, don't say it.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,020
Let's discuss the shooting content.

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,860
This camera seems to have some issues.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,290
Why are you so nervous?

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,190
Your face is so red.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,780
You clearly remember what happened last night, don't you?

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,960
I, I...

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,550
I don't remember.

38
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,440
You don't like me getting close to you?

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,240
I...

40
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,030
If you're not ready yet,

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,960
I can give you more time.

42
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,850
If you're still not sure,

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
I can leave right now.

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Jerk.

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,810
What do you mean, jerk?

46
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,240
Chu Xingyan.

47
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,440
Stop your hunting game.

48
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,750
I don't want to be your prey.

49
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,320
What game?

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,850
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
Isn't that right?

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,909
Once you get something easily,

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,640
you won't cherish it anymore.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm just a passerby.

55
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,880
I can't reach your world.

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,880
I just want to live a quiet life.

57
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,380
You clearly have feelings for me.

58
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,020
Then tell me,

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000

I only go as far as the entrance of your building.

68
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,650

in our communication right now.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,660
Let's take a break for a while.

78
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,480

What are you doing?

101
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,790
I'm going to take a shower.

102
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,220
I thought you left.

104
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,680
Why would I leave?

105
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,770
I just went out to make a phone call.

106
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,180
Phone call?

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,490
Isn't your phone...

108
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,020
Right there?

109
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,830
Then I'll go take a shower first.

110
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,130
Have a seat for a while.

111
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,490
Why take a shower now?

112
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,910
He's doing this on purpose, isn't he?

113
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,640
To make ripples on this lake again.

114
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,550
That person.

115
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Is it you?

116
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,590
Maybe I won't take a shower now.

117
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,850
What are you filming today?

118
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,570
What are you going to do?

119
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm the director, you know.

120
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,860
Aren't you supposed to be filming a documentary?

121
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,260
Then please,

122
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,680
experience the real me.

123
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,720
Today,

124
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going home to pack my clothes.

125
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,110
I'm leaving now.

126
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,160
The cam...
