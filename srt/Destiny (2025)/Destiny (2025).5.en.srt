[Episode 5]

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,720
Who is this?

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,280
Oh, I'm...

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,940
That's none of your business.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,480
Ruan.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Come here.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,180
Your hair is all messy.

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,069
Xingyan.

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,830
It's been three years.

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,920
Are you still mad at me?

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,039
Miss Lin,

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,950
we're not familiar at all.

14
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,370
Don't say things that might give people
the wrong idea.

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,410
Do you have to be so cold toward me?

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,470
We still have to work together.

17
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,030
"Back in Time to Love You."

18
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,950
I am the lead actress in this movie.

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,400
We'll be working together
for the next three months.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,900
I really hope we can get along well,

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
like we used to.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Okay?

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,220
Looking forward to working together.

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,880
Work is work.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,600
There's no need to keep up the act off-set.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,210
Let's go.

27
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,340
You and Lin Haohao knew each other before?

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
Your ex-girlfriend?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,930
Are you jealous?

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,759
Relax.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
We have nothing going on now.

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,290
Don't flatter yourself.

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm approaching this from a
professional perspective

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,010
to enrich your public image.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Song Ruan.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Is it really that hard to admit that you like me?

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,100
Don't...

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,500
Please focus on work during work hours.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,360
Not everything needs to be about feelings.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,860
Didn't I tell you last time?

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,470
You men are all the same to me.

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,840
You're all cabbages.

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm a cabbage, huh?

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,200
Pretty much, yes.

45
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,590
Song Ruan,

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,730
are you addicted to playing this
push-and-pull game?

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,170
If you say so.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Which part bothers you?

49
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,810
No.

50
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,940
Fine, if all you see me as is a cabbage.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,320
But the good ones always get eaten by pigs.

52
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,300
Stinky cabbage, rotten cabbage.

53
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,740
Jiang Feng?

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,400
Didn't you say you weren't available?

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,220
Why did you suddenly agree to
take on this movie?

56
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,820
Is it because of Chu Xingyan?

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah. So what?

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,920
It's been three years.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,740
You still haven't moved on?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,720
Wasn't the pain he caused you back then enough?

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,589
Jiang Feng.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,730
That's between Xingyan and me.

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
It has nothing to do with you.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
After all these years...

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,690
haven't you realized how I feel about you?

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,760
Haohao,

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
I know you've always been good to me.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
But Xingyan is my first love.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,520
I just want to go back to how things were
with him.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,280
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
There are a lot of paparazzi outside.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,740
You should go back now.

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,170
It'd be bad if they caught us together.

74
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,080
Jiang Feng!

75
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,600
This movie is really important to me.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,159
I don't want anything to go wrong with it.

77
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,960
If you really care about me,

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,730
let's work together to finish it well, okay?

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Just watch, Haohao.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,830
I'll show you

81
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,880
that only I

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,840
deserve to be your leading man.

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,680
Alright.

[You're The Best]

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,560
You came into my life

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,420
and showed me that happiness
was never that hard to find.

[I Love You]

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,770
No dream without you could ever compare.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,070
I'll say goodbye only when I wake
from this dream.

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Waiting for the next shooting star to fall.

Let's forget all those profound philosophies.

97
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,660

Xingyan!

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you all for coming to listen
to my new song.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,850
I hope it not only brings you
a wonderful experience

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,760
but also allows me to share a glimpse
of my inner world with you.

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,120
This is my first attempt at composing both
the lyrics and the music myself.

106
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,200
Sometimes, the connection between people
is truly miraculous.

107
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I used to believe my heart was like a lake

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,940
that would remain calm... no matter
how big the storms were.

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,280
But then, someone

110
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,540
suddenly walked into my life

111
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,050
and stirred ripples across that quiet lake.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
Is that person...

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
you?

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,160
It's me! It's me!

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,000
You need to stay calm.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,730
You need to stay clear-headed.

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
He wasn't talking to you.

118
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
What's wrong?

119
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Why are you throwing yourself at me?

120
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,940
Was my performance just now pretty good?

121
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,930
H-How could that be?

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
It was just... average.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,860
What's wrong? Why are you breathing so heavily?

124
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
You don't think that the confession

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,640
just now was meant for you, right?

126
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,010
What confession?

127
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
I...

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
I didn't hear anything.

129
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,520
What are you trying to do now?

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,140
Water.

131
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,990
Was my performance today...

132
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
not good enough?

133
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,720
I think

134
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,380
there must be something I didn't do well enough.

135
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,220
Mr. Chu, please behave yourself.

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Don't think that just because you're a celebrity,

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,660
you can keep getting closer to me.

138
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,420
You're late.

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,670
I'm here for work.

142
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,820
Don't mention what happened yesterday.

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,350
What are you talking about?

144
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,310
I've completely forgotten it.

145
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,310
Now you're reminding me.

146
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,680
It's best if you've forgotten.

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Nobody should think about it again.

148
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,320
Let's go.

149
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,740

Thank you for the compliment.

Mainly...

164
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,720
because you ride the horse well.

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,370
I still prefer the way you were before.

What was I like?

168
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Objective and casual.

169
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,350
Can't you just say what you mean directly?

170
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,400
Well, to like someone is to love everything
about them.

171
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,560
You accept everything about her,

173
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,730
You're so glib.

174
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,010
You always come up with such strange things
to say.

175
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,240
Let's call it a day.

176
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,840
Goodbye.

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,450
What?

178
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,800
Step aside.

179
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,410
Running away again?

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,090
I...

181
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,320
Do you know

182
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,360
that avoiding someone is a sign of liking them?

183

If you keep this up...

184
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,790
I'm afraid you might dream about me tonight.

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
Xingyan!

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,180
There's a private dinner before the film
starts shooting.

190
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,580
All the main creators, actors, and investors
need to attend.

191
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,290
It's tomorrow night.

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,650
Check the schedule.

193
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
If there's nothing scheduled,

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,760
I'll go.

195
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,680
Okay.

196
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,750
Don't dream tonight.

197
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,300
Mr. Qin Shou,

198
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,700
do you take Miss Song Ruan to be your wife?

199
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
I do.

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,820
Miss Song Ruan,

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,640
do you take this man before you as your husband?

202
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,120
I...

203
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,840
Miss Song Ruan,

204
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,440
do you take this man before you as your husband?

205
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,960
Miss Song Ruan,

206
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,560
do you take this man before you as your husband?

207
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,750
Xingyan!

208
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,260
Come with me.
