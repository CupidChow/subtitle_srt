00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,520
I'm taking this opportunity today

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,040
to teach you a harsh lesson.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,800
Not everyone

can happily get things done in this world.

7
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,530
I can't,

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,930
and neither can you.

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,320
So what can I film?

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,930
Say something.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,640
What do you mean?

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,010
Your mom's got quite an attitude.

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,960
Don't be upset.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,570
You're already so outstanding.

15
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,080
Although you have some worries,

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,320
you're rich.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,930
And you have such a beautiful girlfriend.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,430
What girlfriend?

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,950
Miss Zhu, of course.

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,410
Gentle, beautiful, and caring.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,930
Can I film a story about the two of you?

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,229
If you don't want to, forget it.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
I said forget it. You...

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,500
She's my agent.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
With your EQ,

if you don't know how to speak properly, then don't.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,740

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,820
Ms. Le,

32
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,520
I agreed to play the supporting male role

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
because I thought the lead

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,579
would be the award-winning actor Liu Shu.

35
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,140
But now you suddenly tell me

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,840
that the lead has changed to Chu Xingyan.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,350
Liu Shu broke his leg a while ago

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
and needs to rest for half a year.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
We just decided on Chu Xingyan.

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
Why should a singer be the lead?

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,720
And I have to play second fiddle to him?

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,380
He became famous for singing,

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,600
but he also majored in acting.

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,630
And I've seen his acting.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,700
It's very good.

46
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,470
Plus, he brings his own fan base.

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,570
He's our best choice right now.

48
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,720
Ms. Le,

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,920
if he can play the lead,

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,620
why can't I?

51
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,560
My fan base isn't small either.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,680
And my fee can be cheaper than his.

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,500
Why don't you consider me?

54
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,690
Jiang Feng,

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,760
this isn't about the fee.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,850
I know you don't get along with him,

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
but this movie

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
is crucial for our company.

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,970

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,480
Right now, I can't consider your feelings.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Fine.

64
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,040
Since you insist

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,300
on making him the lead,

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll quit.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160

Your contract was signed first.

You can breach it if you want,

71
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,040
but there's a fivefold penalty.

Now can we discuss the filming plan?

193
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,420
Okay.

194
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,840
Shake hands.

195
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,290
The dog needs spiritual communication.

[Ripple Culture Media]

197
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Can you sign an autograph for me?

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,760
Sign here.

199
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,400
Okay.

200
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
When I was young,

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,370
we had a dog at home.

202
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,400
It was very old

203
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,740
and about to die.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,110
It just quietly hid in a corner.

205
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,800
Without careful observation,

206
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,440
experience,

207
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,400
and on-site inspection,

208
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
you rushed to decide on filming.

209
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,680
Song Ruan,

210
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,170
your approach is too random

211
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,300
and lacks planning.

212
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Overall,

213
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,080
the advantage of the footage is obvious.

214
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
It's authentic and can

215
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,920
resonate emotionally with the audience.

216
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
You're absolutely right.

218
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,450
I designed and planned all of this myself.

219
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,600
Not bad.

220
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,440
I'll increase the budget for this project.

221
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Mr. Cui,

222
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,660
for the upcoming documentary filming,

223
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,720
you need to focus on

224
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,840
capturing Chu Xingyan's love life.

225
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,310
I've got information

226
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,900
that he's got some romantic entanglements.

227
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,090
We need to seize this opportunity

228
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,270
to dig deep

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,710
and try to make it a big headline.

230
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Rest assured,

231
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,880
I promise to do my best.
