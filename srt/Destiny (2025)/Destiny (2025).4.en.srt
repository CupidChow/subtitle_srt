00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Geez.

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Getting up so early to exercise.

5
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,130
I didn't get enough sleep

6
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,490
and eat breakfast.

7
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,130
What's wrong, Director Song?

8
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,170
You woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,000
Why not run for a bit to calm down?

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,960
Please don't interfere with my work.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm going to take a shower first.

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,490
I'll treat you to breakfast later.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,820
You’ve got a little conscience.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,080

Song.

23
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,930
Mr. Cui, why are you here?

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Director Ouyang takes this very seriously.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
He said you're new

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,080
and asked me to guide you.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Artists are always late,

28
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,759
not following the schedule.

29
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,200
Never mind, I'll wait with you.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
No, Mr. Cui.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,280
I've already filmed.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,840
See.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,050
Your camera position is not right.

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,640
Come on.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,220
If you want to make a man look imposing,

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,880
you need to lower your camera.

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,800
Like this, Mr. Cui?

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,690
Lift it up a bit.

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,500
Like this?

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,639
Let me

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,830
help you.

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,480
Like this.

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,120
Mr. Cui...

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,050
Is it better now?

45
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,120
Mr. Cui...

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,530
Mr. Cui, what are you doing?

47
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,590
What are you doing?

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,630
See.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,310
Who is it?

50
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,210
What are you doing?

51
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,000
I-It's a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm Cui Yongzhi, the Editor-in-Chief of Ripple.

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,620
I was helping her adjust the camera position.

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,450
It's all a misunderstanding.

55
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,170
Song, explain!

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,660
He's our Editor-in-Chief, Cui Yongzhi.

57
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,760
Editor-in-Chief.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
I thought some pervert had shown up here,

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,640
touching her in broad daylight.

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
I-It was just

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
for the documentary's sake.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,650
I was teaching her how to
adjust the camera more professionally.

63
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,910
More professionally?

64
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,060
Isn't this my documentary?

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,820
Shouldn't I be the one deciding on the camera position?

66
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,480
Besides, the contract clearly states

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,120
that to protect my privacy,

68
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,260
only one filming crew member
is allowed to follow me.

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
Right.

70
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Then I'll leave.

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,060
I won't disturb you anymore.

72
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,680
Song, keep it up.

73
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm leaving.

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,400
Keep up?

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,980
Who needs your concern?

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,140
Are you alright?

77
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,490
I'm fine.

78
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,270
Don't just stand there, let's have breakfast.

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,170
How can a girl be so careless?

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,540
How was I supposed to know
he was that kind of person?

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,740
I'm just here to work.

82
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,940
No matter what you do in the future,

83
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
you need to protect yourself first.

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,280
You should bravely resist such workplace harassment.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
I didn't notice before...

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,120
What didn't you notice?

87
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,210
You're quite harsh with me,

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,120
but so soft on others.

89
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,160
This kind of person only pushes his luck

90
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,520
and picks on the easy targets.

91
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,400
If you tolerate him once,

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,860
they'll keep challenging your boundaries.

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
I see.

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
I'll be careful next time.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Next time?

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,690
There shouldn't be a next time.

97
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
I was just saying.

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
Never mind, it’s no use talking to you about it.

99
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,570
Look how skinny you are.

100
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,390
Go work out first.

101
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,210
I’ll teach you some self-defense moves.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,860
Stay calm when facing problems.

103
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,380
Especially for someone like you,

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,909
who's at a disadvantage in size and strength.

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,409
Don’t try to compete in strength.

106
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,350
Then what should I compete in?

107
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,390
What do you think?

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,430
How would I know?

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Technique.

110
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,260
Technique?

111
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,270
Come, hit me.

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,280
Throw a punch.

113
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,350
Are you okay?

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,660
I'm fine.

115
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,640
Today I'll teach you a shoulder throw.

116
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,660
Let's break down the moves.

117
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Put up your fists.

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
If the opponent raises one hand in front of you.

119
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,620
Hit me.

120
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,520
Start with a block,

121
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,820
then turn your hand around to grab his arm.

122
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,990
Step in close to his body.

123
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,810
Tuck your hand

124
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,200
into his armpit.

125
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,400
This makes it easier to exert strength.

126
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,320
Turn around and retract your leg.

127
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,650
Use your hips to push against his abdomen.

128
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,020
Then,

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,750
turn firmly towards your waist.

130
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,190
Okay?

131
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,380
Okay.

132
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
Alright, try it.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,010
Okay.

134
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,910
Here I come.

135
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,590
Right.

136
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,710
Step in.

137
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,990
You're too far from me.

138
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,210
Your foot needs to be closer to me.

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
This way, it's easier for your hips

140
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
to lift me up.

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,960
T-Turn your body.

142
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,550
Harder.

143
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
Three, two, one, go!

144
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,660
Can you do it?

145
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Use all your strength!

146
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,620
What do you mean?

147
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,680
I mean the strength of all your ancestors.

148
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,220
You brat!

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,280

Tell me.

158
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,860
Was he really taking advantage of me?

159
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,850
Who's advantage?

160
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,600
Are you even listening to me?

161
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,450
I'm talking about Chu Xingyan.

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,340
What happened?

163
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,680
He took me to practice self-defense today.

164
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,050
I was falling apart.

165
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,660
You were falling apart?

166
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,280
It's not what you're thinking.

167
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
I mean.

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,320
He was tossing me around like a sandbag,

169
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,440
just like Hulk tossing Loki.

170
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,080
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

171
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,360
Think about it.
He tossed you around like that.

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,410
Doesn’t that just mean
he wanted to have some physical contact with you?

173
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,340
Looks like he’s interested in you.

174
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,140
Stop it.

175
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,280
It’s all

176
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
just acting.

177
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,340
Let me foretell it for you.

178
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,850
The front means you get lucky.

179
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,250
The back means you don't.

180
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,039
Look.

181
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,990
You get lucky!

182
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,440
Chu Xingyan and me?

183
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,020
He's a superstar.

184
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,040
Who am I?

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
You’re not lacking arms or legs.

186
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,680
The way he’s been acting around you

187
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,300
means he likes you.

188
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,490
I don't want to be just another fish in his pond.

189
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,770
You can live in many ponds too.

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
He has his fishes.

191
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
You have your ponds.

192
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,970
You were saying

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
he’s gentle, thoughtful,

194
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,280
and knows how to care for people.

195
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,880
Except for occasional disappearance,

196
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,700
and the fact that
he won’t go public with his relationship.

197
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,330
He seems flawless.

198
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Imagine.

199
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,370
Dating a handsome guy like him.

200
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,910
So cool.

201
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,660
Remember. You have one more friend

202
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,750
means you have one more direction.

203
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,940
You have one more boyfriend

204
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,470
means you get one more home.

205
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,550
I don’t want to date right now.

206
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,430
I just want to finish my work smoothly.

207
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,520
These two matters do not conflict.

208
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
You get to date

209
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,360
and the company pays for it.

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,400
Such a good thing.

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,460
I couldn't even have an opportunity.

212
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,040
No way.

213
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
I can’t make

214
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,650
the same mistake again.

215
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,000
He’s not the right person for me.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,720
He’s not the right person for me.

217
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,580
He’s not the right person for me.

218
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,330
Remember.

219
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,150
He’s not the right person for me.

220
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,870
What a hassle.

221
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,260
Don't be nervous.

222
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,920
They're looking towards the door.

223
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,510
They shouldn't be waiting for you.

224
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,730
So many reporters.

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,760
It's probably another superstar.

226
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Let's go back.

227
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,000
Lin Haohao is here.

228
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,160
Lin Haohao, look this way.

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,320
Over here, Lin Haohao.

230
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
Lin Haohao is here.

231
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,200
Look over here.

232
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,290
Look at the camera, Lin Haohao.

233
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,470
Look this way.

234
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,040
Look this way.

235
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,200
Lin Haohao, look at the camera.

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,920
Haohao.

237
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,180
Are you here in Anzhou to film a new drama?

238
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,640
Haohao.

239
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,760
You’ve been nominated
for Best Actress at the Golden Sheep Awards.

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Do you have anything to say?

241
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,760
Sorry.

242
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,280
We are not accepting any interviews at the moment.

243
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Please stay tuned for official updates.

244
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,880
Thank you.

245
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,290
Chu Xingyan!

246
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,760
They haven’t appeared on the same stage for 3 years.

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,640
Could it be that
they're collaborating on a new drama?

248
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,240
Say something, Chu Xingyan.

249
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,190
Chu Xingyan, say a few words to us.

250
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,320
Tell us a bit more!

251
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Are you and Lin Haohao getting back together?

252
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Chu Xingyan!
