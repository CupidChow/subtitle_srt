00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
I... I just can't be like you actors,

188
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
so in control of your emotions.

189
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,290
Do you know that?

190
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,430
Ruan.

191
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,930
I need some time to calm down by myself.

192
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,200
Please listen to me.

193
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,560
I want some time alone.

194
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm sorry. You focus on filming.

195
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,740
Ruan!
