That has nothing to do with me.

191
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,710
You don't need to explain to me.

192
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,620
How is it not your business?

193
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
You're my girl.

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Again.

195
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,220
What are we filming today?

196
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,870
Nothing.

197
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,960
I have an appointment tonight.

198
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,050
Can I go too?

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Why do you want to go?

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
There’ll be drinking.

201
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,880
But we agreed to film

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,340
your daily life every day.

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,720
I haven't filmed anything today.

204
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Alright then.

205
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,580
No drinking.

206
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,470
Okay.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,950
Are you going to drink?

208
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,480
Of course.

209
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,900
I can hold my liquor.

210
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,030
Then can I film you drinking?
