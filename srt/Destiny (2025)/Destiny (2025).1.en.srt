I'm going through...

189
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,630
a "sick-of-men" phase.

190
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,580
All men are the same

191
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,500
in my eyes.

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,030
Just like heads of cabbage.

193
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,340
Let's start over, shall we?

194
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,760
You're so smooth.

195
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,260
What's your main responsibility at the magazine?

196
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,620
Producer and... director.

197
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,180
Producer and director.

198
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,140
Big-time director,

199
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,300
big-time producer, huh?

200
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,430
Looking forward to seeing your
9.0-rated masterpiece.

201
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,660
Hello?

202
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,740
Zhu Yan.

203
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,680
Ripple magazine?

204
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,410
Why did you sign me up for a documentary?

205
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,060
Alright, then.

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,000
Got it.

207
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,370
Mr. Chu, do you believe me now?

208
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
How do you want to shoot this?

209
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,660
To capture a male artist well,

210
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,980
you need to use the perspective of female fans.

211
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,500
My approach is

212
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,880
to view through my lens as a female fan would,

213
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,650
to show your truest self.

214
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,300
But aren't you sick of men now?

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,820
How are you gonna turn into a fangirl?

216
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,670
I'm very good at separating personal
and professional matters.

217
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,450
Once I'm in work mode,

218
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,640
I swear

219
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,430
I'll capture you... clearly and thoroughly.

220
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,580
Clearly and thoroughly, huh?

221
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,060
Yes.

222
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,820
How thorough are we talking?

223
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,060
Will it include my privacy?

224
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
What privacy?

225
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
You tell me.

226
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
You...

227
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,860
For now, you'll only be allowed to film

228
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,580
content related to my work as an actor.

229
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,140
And the specific content of the shoot

230
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,220
will be decided depending on my mood on that day.

231
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,020
Why?

232
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,780
No reason why.

233
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,820
Fine.

234
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,680
Let's discuss the schedule then.

235
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,300
All scheduling will, of course, be according to
my arrangements.

236
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm very busy

237
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,140
and very expensive.

238
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,470
Fine.

239
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,100
However,

240
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,610
as your collaborating party,

241
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,100
I also have one condition.

242
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,340
Go on.

243
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,400
I want exclusive rights.

244
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,270
Quite possessive, aren't you?

245
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,940
Why should I agree to that?

246
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,460
During filming,

247
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,780
I'll follow your lead.

248
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,180
And you'll have final approval on the edit.

249
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,510
Isn't that all standard practice?

250
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,460
Now you're presenting these as conditions
to negotiate with me.

251
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,060
Is this your first time working with an artist,

252
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
little eel?

253
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Are you an intern?

254
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,330
Forget it, forget it.

255
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,060
I suppose I could agree.

256
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,880
I didn't bring an assistant with me this time.

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,960
You'll have to be my assistant during the shoot.

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,670
On call at all times.

259
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,540
M-Me?

260
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,600
If you can't do it, then forget it.

261
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,260
Fine, I'll try my best.

262
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,580
Here... have these signed photos.

263
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,460
No need.

264
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,710
Hang them above your bed

265
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,340
so you can study them every day and think about
how to film me properly.

266
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,740
I hope that through your filming
this time, Director Song...

267
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,550
people will see a different side of me.

268
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,800
They definitely will.

269
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,610
Liking me...

270
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,460
is nothing to be ashamed of.
