[Episode 18]

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,120
According to the date on that Instagram post,

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
I traced those two models

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,360
and got the hallway surveillance footage

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,390
from the hotel where they later checked into a suite.

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:46,510
[Sunday, May 19, 2024 – hallway]

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,600
The cameras clearly recorded their check-in and check-out times.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
Turns out, they deliberately pretended

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,300
to be leaving from Xingyan’s room.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,430
They even rehearsed it at the door,

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,770
acting it out three times,

13
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,050
and picked one take

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,800
to edit into that fake threesome video

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
to frame Xingyan.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,540
Now with this surveillance footage,

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,800
it's enough to prove you were maliciously framed.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,940
I've already reported it to the police.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,470
They'll catch the person who framed you soon.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
That's great.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,200
So,

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,650
we'll send the surveillance video to the PR company.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,860
Soon,

24
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,950
everyone will know you're innocent.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,400
Le has already informed me

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,310
that the film will start production as originally scheduled.

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,990
Xingyan,

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,080
congratulations.

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,860
Thank you.

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,500
From now on,

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,340
no one is allowed to insult my boyfriend

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,140
for being a fallen star anymore.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,450
When I was a child, my family was very strict.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,720
Everything was arranged by my mother.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,040
The only happy thing

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,850
was when my father brought me here to ride horses.

37
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,250
Your mother was too strict, wasn't she?

38
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,240
She thought horseback riding was frivolous,

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,380
a waste of time.

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,880
But I really envied those people at the riding club,

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,090
carefree

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,370
and free.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,510
So I'll never forget the day

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,950
when my father secretly brought me here to ride horses,

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,930
just like how I'm bringing you now.

46
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,960
But the good times didn't last long.

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,290
Just when I had learned to gallop,

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,680
my mother found out.

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
She had a big fight with my father,

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,140
saying he shouldn't have brought me out.

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,960
But when I was a child,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,980
I envied kids like you the most.

53
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,880
You could get anything you wanted.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,260
Unlike me,

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,760
for just one toy,

56
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,840
I had to throw tantrums and beg my mom.

57
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,150
Throwing tantrums?

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
That's nothing.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
When I was a kid,

60
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,630
I even stole fruit from the neighbors.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,680
Ended up getting caught red-handed.

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,160
I used to dress up as a ghost to scare people at night.

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,450
Later, the adults found out

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,340
and chased me for several blocks.

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
That's wonderful.

66
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,610
I even ran away from home when I was little.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,320
However,

68
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,650
the farthest I got was the entrance of our residential complex.

69
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,710
That's running away from home too?

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,579
Why wouldn't it count?

71
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,890
That's about as adventurous as you got.

72
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,230
The film is going to start production again.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,630
The time I can spend with you

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,250
won't be as much anymore.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,100
Hello?

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,840
Hello.

77
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,460
Miss Song.

78
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,690
I'm Chu Xingyan's mother.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,420
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight.

80
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,080
Is that convenient for you?

81
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,620
Yes, auntie.

82
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,410
Okay.

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,190
I'll send you the address.

84
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,940
Okay.

85
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,490
This is a small hotel owned by our family.

86
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,550
It has the best restaurant in the city

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,520
and world-class chefs.

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,250
I hope you will like it.

89
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,310
Thank you, Mrs. Chu.

90
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,020
You're too kind.

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,900
Hello, Mrs. Chu.

92
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,880
Please come in, Miss Song.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Let's see what you'd like to eat.

94
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,940
Thank you.

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,560
This head chef, Aven, studied in France.

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
He specializes in various high-end Western cuisines.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,280
All these ingredients

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,159
are air-freighted from France.

99
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,120
The cooking methods are very complex.

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
The taste is extremely delicate.

101
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
Miss Song, you can give it a try.

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
This is all in a foreign language.

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,410
I don't really understand it.

104
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,490
It's Spanish.

105
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,700
Miss Song, please take a look.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,760
If you don't like it,

107
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,290
I can ask them to bring a Chinese menu instead.

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
No need, Auntie.

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Anything is fine with me.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,560
Well, in that case,

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
I'll choose for you.

112
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,860
Okay.

113
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,210
Let's order what I usually have.

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,860
Come, Miss Song.

115
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,400
Don't be shy, please.

116
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Alright.

117
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,780
By the way, Miss Song,

118
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,570
I heard your family also runs a restaurant.

119
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,000
When do I get a chance

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
to try it out as well?

121
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
I usually enjoy

122
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,930
tasting street food from around the world.

123
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,010
Our place is just an outdoor farm.

124
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,530
The snacks are just

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,480
things like fried skewers and spicy hot pot.

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,340
The prices are quite affordable.

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,670
That should be very good value for money.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,440
Let's begin.

129
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
Okay.

130
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,380
Miss Song,

131
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,150
let me be straightforward.

132
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,250
Alright.

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,510
I want to make you my goddaughter.

134
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,570
You won't have to work so hard anymore.

135
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,830
There are many positions in our company.

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
You can choose any one you like.

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,710
Also, I'll give your parents a shop.

138
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,159
This way, your parents

139
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,560
won't have to work so hard in the future.

140
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,750
What do you think?

141
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,050
Thank you, Auntie.

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
But...

143
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,380
Oh, Miss Song,

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
what kind of boys do you like?

145
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,270
I know many young gentlemen from my friends' families.

146
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,650
They're all quite good.

147
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,540
Mrs. Chu,

148
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,140
I appreciate your kindness.

149
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,360
However...

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,040
As long as you give up Xingyan.

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Why?

152
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,820
Because

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,820
you don't deserve him.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Alright.

155
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,150
Let's begin.

156
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,070
Please enjoy your meal.

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,840
I want to make you my goddaughter.

158
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,100
There are many positions in our company.

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,760
You can choose any one you like.

160
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,100
Also, I'll give your parents a shop.

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,560
This way, your parents

162
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,760
won't have to work so hard in the future.

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,920
What kind of boys do you like?

164
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,680
I know many young gentlemen from my friends' families.

165
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,010
They're all quite good.

166
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,040
I appreciate your kindness.

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,440
However...

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,040
As long as you give up Xingyan.

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Why?

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,080
Because

171
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,030
you don't deserve him.

172
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,240
If I can't even get a college degree,

173
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,970
and there's such a huge gap between me and the Chu family,

174
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,440
I...

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Do I really deserve him?

176
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,919
[Back in Time to Love You]

177
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,100
Thank you to all our media friends

178
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,820
and movie enthusiasts from all walks of life.

179
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,320
Next, let's welcome our director, Ling San,

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
to share with us

181
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,200
his journey in making this film.

182
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,030
Thank you, everyone.

183
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,960
First of all,

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm honored to be the director.

185
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,040
After three months of preparation,

186
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,810
we're finally ready to meet you all.

187
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you for your support.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Now, let me introduce

189
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,060
our lead actor,

190
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Chu Xingyan.

191
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Come on,

192
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
let's have Chu Xingyan

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
say a few words, shall we?

194
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,100
Thank you, everyone.

195
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,880
It's my first time in this city,

196
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,760
and I can already feel its warmth.

197
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,000
It's very fitting for our movie's theme,

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
"Back in Time to Love You."

199
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,320
I believe if we could really go back in time,

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
this city would be full of beautiful memories.

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
I hope when the movie is released,

202
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,140
it will live up to everyone's expectations.

203
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,490
Our beautiful leading lady, Haohao,

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,680

205
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
