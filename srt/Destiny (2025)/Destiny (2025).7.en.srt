00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,280
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,060
What's with those photos online?

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
They're fake.

5
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,120
Do you have any idea how much damage

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,960
these videos would do

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,760
to our Chu family if they got out?

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,360
You're tarnishing the Chu family's reputation.

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,610
If your father were still here,

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,880
how would he feel about this?

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,160
If my father were still here,

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,560
he would definitely believe me.

13
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,370
Are you saying I don't trust you?

14
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,260
All these years,

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,660
you've been using acting as an excuse

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,430
to waste your days away.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,160
You think I don't know?

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,650
You've

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
completely lost my trust.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
The Chu family can have your online news deleted.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,920
You will immediately follow my arrangements

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,440
and come back to join the company.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,360
I don't need to.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,070
I have my own plans.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,840
Being an actor is my dream.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,970
Don't project your menopause onto...

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,579
The door wasn't closed properly.

28
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,690
Are you okay?

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,640
Does it still hurt?

30
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,079
Compared to the pain,

31
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,540
isn't it more embarrassing to be seen by you?

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,570
What's there to be embarrassed about?

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,820
When I was little,

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,850
my dad often chased me with a slipper to beat me.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,160
What?

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Everyone in this world

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,600
wants to change others,

38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,230
especially overbearing parents.

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,079
They just hope their children

40
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,960
can do as they please.

41
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,790
What do you mean?

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,640
Whose side are you on?

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm on your mother's side.

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,090
After all,

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,350
I'll have my own child to discipline.

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,920
You're still...

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
But I'm also on your side.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,190
I'm on someone's side

49
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,980
because

50
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,320
he persists in the career he loves,

51
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,470
with

52
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,440
with a stubbornness that defies fate.

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,040
You're who you are.

54
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,060
You don't need everyone's approval.

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,540
As long as you have a clear conscience yourself,

56
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,460
no one can stop you.

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
As expected from a documentary filmmaker,

58
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,940
always with these fancy theories.

59
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm just speaking the truth.

60
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,220
We all face many obstacles

61
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,010
on our journey forward.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,480
Whether you can keep going

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,790
depends on how determined

64
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,800
and brave you are.

65
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,860
Thank you.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,040
You're welcome.

67
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,620
But your dad is indeed quite harsh.

68
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,540
Miss Song,

69
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,680
where's your camera?

70
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,250
Chu Xingyan isn't in a good state today,

71
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,550
so there's no filming.

72
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,070
If you're not filming, why are you here?

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
Today,

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,140
I just want to keep him company as a friend.

75
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Keep him company?

76
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,760
Miss Song,

77
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,040
you're overstepping.

78
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,690
Xingyan doesn't need friends.

79
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,920
For all these years,

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
only I, as his agent,

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,050
have the right to always be by his side.

82
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,730
Oh.

83
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,540
You...

84
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
like him?

85
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,160
What are you talking about?

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
My care for Xingyan

87
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,200
is purely out of professional duty

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,960
and admiration for his talent.

89
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,660
But doesn't that mean

90
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,160
you do have feelings for him?

91
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,440
What do you know?

92
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,920
He and I are comrades-in-arms.

93
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
For all these years,

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
his career is my career,

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,560
and his affairs are my affairs.

96
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
I won't allow anyone to affect his future.

97
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,600
So, Miss Song, mind your position.

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I don't want you to bring any

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,560
unnecessary gossip to Xingyan.

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello?

101
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,720
Song Ruan,

102
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,510
let's have dinner together tonight.

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,240
Why?

104
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,480
You're so good at comforting people.

105
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,540
I should treat you to something nice.

106
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,440
No need.

107
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm going to have instant noodles.

108
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,430
What instant noodles?

109
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,610
Are you coming or not?

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,670
If you're not coming, I'll come find you.

111
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,580
Don't come.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Then send me the location.

113
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Okay.

114
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Never listening to what others say.

115
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,130
Zhu Yan,

116
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,600
I remember now.

117
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,880
During that MV shoot,

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,080
two scenes were filmed in my suite.

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,840
The next day,

120
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,440
the two female models from the MV knocked on my door,

121
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,640
saying they left their makeup in my room

122
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,150
and needed to go in to look for it.

123
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,760
So if we contact the hotel

124
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,290
and get the hotel's surveillance footage,

125
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,280
we can prove

126
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,940
they really were there to look for their makeup.

127
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,790
Okay.

128
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,360
I've finished ordering.

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,960
Why haven't you ordered yet?

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,720
You're being framed and smeared right now,

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,450
accused of being a big playboy.

132
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,690
Nonsense.
