1
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:41,840
Jujube

2
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,600
It's broken, isn't it

3
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,600
You these days

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,600
This is a sky-high price to send Vitex negundo from house to house

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,600
You don't even have time to learn from me and your aunt

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,280
Today I

7
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,760
We both have to teach you a good job

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm just waiting for you to teach me

9
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Say it quickly

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Get it

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,080
Watch it

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,640
First

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Have you been watching

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,840
That pile

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,280
Vitex has to be blistered

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,800
Toughness after foaming

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,440
You don't care whether it is red wattle or white wax

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,880
It's too dry to use

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
It folds easily

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,320
This soaked Vitex negundo depends on its thickness

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,160
Different Vitex have different uses

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Do you know

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,160
Jujube

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,840
This basket must be bottomed first

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,680
Put away

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,880
Then there is the safety system

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Then this warp insertion horizontal knitting

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,280
Finally, the edge is closed

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,200
Every step of this can't be vague

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
This basket is so complicated

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Where is it complicated? It's so simple

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
Let's talk about the base first

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Aunt Uncle

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
See if it's made up, okay

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,080
Don't say jujube

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,360
You have a clever hand

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,400
Decent, huh

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,120
It's not that hard

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,760
Not difficult

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,480
Jujube

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
See if your hand is worn out

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
What is this? It doesn't hurt

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,960
No pain

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,840
Jujube

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,040
When did you act like uncle

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
All the cocoons are worn out

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
Even if you learn home,

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,440
You have to say so

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
Then I'm still practicing

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
Okay, good

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
Forty-three four four four four four six four seven

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,480
Forty-eight

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,200
Jujube

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Iron egg, why are you here

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,280
How come you're free today

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,480
I missed you

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,880
This is not a busy time

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Did you come to see you specially

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,680
You have a conscience

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,880
I thought you'd forgotten me

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,200
Joke

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,040
I can't forget who can't forget you

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
In your house, in the courtyard

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,680
Why are there so many baskets and baskets

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,360
This is me starting the neighborhood

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
And your uncle Aunt Li

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
We made it up ourselves

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,760
Why did you start the neighbors to make this up

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,600
What for

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Raise money to buy planes for volunteers

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,240
I see

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
Yes, jujube

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,680
Mobilize the masses to be self-reliant

74
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,400
Interesting

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
You see, I made this up

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,720
Isn't it beautiful

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Take a closer look

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,360
Reliable

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Jujube, do you still have Vitex negundo here

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Why don't you teach me

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,240
I'll make one up, too

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,680
To our volunteers on the front line

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Make a contribution

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Can you make it up? You

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Can't you teach me

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,560
Row

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Teach you can

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,520
But you have to call Master

89
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,640
Master

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,160
What

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,399
Master

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,639
Hurry up

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
Master

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,160
OK, then let's practice

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
I'll teach you

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,120
You see

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,400
One pick and one pressure

98
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,800
Put this under this first

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,800
Press down

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,000
And then put this in this

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Sure

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
That's what it means

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Put it in

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Watch your hands

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,040
Look

106
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Press it here

107
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,680
Come slowly

108
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,840
Boss Zhuang

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,720
Boss Zhuang

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,280
Received the goods

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Coming, coming

112
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Jujube leader

113
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,360
What's wrong with you?

114
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,960
Boss Zhuang

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,600
From today on

116
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,960
You don't have to go to the south exit to pull goods anymore

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Everything in your store

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
What basket, basket and dustpan

119
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,960
I'll pack it all for you

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,480
You collected these from Nankouzi

121
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
What to collect?

122
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
This is all us

123
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
And the neighbors made it up by themselves

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
Ah, what

125
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,600
Ah Toad

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Quickly inspect the goods and give money

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,320
Quick and quick

128
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,320
Come

129
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,240
How is it

130
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,040
Not bad, huh

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
It's okay, isn't it

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,360
It's just that the work is a little rough

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
How fine is your Vitex basket

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Anyway, that's what I'll tell you

135
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,440
Starting today

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
I can deliver the goods to you regularly

137
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
You don't have to go to the south exit to pull goods anymore

138
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,680
Go ahead. How much is it each

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,400
Get

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,400
Come

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
What are you doing

142
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Count it

143
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,600
What's the number?

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
Jujube leader

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
You are such a wooden stick

146
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,440
Come on

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Look, you're not a trader either

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Let's do this

149
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
How about this number

150
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,720
What else is it

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
This number

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,160
You give this number alone

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,160
You're not kidding, are you? Boss Zhuang

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
Quite a few

155
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,040
Don't you tell me this

156
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,840
What is the price of the goods imported from your store

157
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I've inquired about everything

158
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,920
Your tumbling price

159
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,160
How big it is

160
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm with this group of children, neighbors

161
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Cut thorns and weave baskets

162
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,880
Cocoons are worn out on my hands

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
You give this number

164
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,960
How dare you

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,880
That's not what Tian Xiaozao said in his words

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
I have received your goods now

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
I saved some money for horses and chariots

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,640
But I offended

169
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,040
Old customers at the south exit

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,360
In case you are unhappy one day, you won't do it

171
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Who am I going to cry for

172
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,960
I

173
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Come on, come on, come on

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,800
I can't tell you about the business either

175
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,000
That's the number

176
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
What if you would

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
You just put these things here

178
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,440
If you don't want to

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Why don't you find another home

180
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,880
Profiteers

181
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,000
Elder sister

182
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,480
What to do

183
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
What can this do

184
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,560
Sell for another house

185
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,440
I can't believe nobody really accepts it

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Elder sister

187
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,960
This is the only grocery store we have here

188
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
If you go to find your next home,

189
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
That's a long way off

190
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,520
The car is full of goods and so heavy

191
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,240
If we push it,

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
That's not exhausting

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
Why don't we set up a mule

194
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
Then where can I find mules

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,480
Let's go back first

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,240
Row

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,720
Go

198
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,640
Go forward first

199
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:12,920
Turn

200
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's go

201
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,640
Slow down

202
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,280
Good

203
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,520
Go

204
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Go

205
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,840
Slow down

206
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Brother, look at this compilation

207
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,080
You have a look

208
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Walk, walk, I don't want it

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,680
Go to the next house

210
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Go

211
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
Go

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,919
There is no discussion

213
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,120
There is no discussion

214
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,320
Walk, walk

215
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,159
Go quickly. I don't want it

216
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,240
What's fierce

217
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,400
Let's go

218
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Are you tired

219
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,400
Elder sister to pull

220
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,400
Elder sister

221
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,160
Will it still be on sale tomorrow

222
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,000
Not a basket has been sold

223
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
How about this, sister

224
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
Let's not always wander around the west of the city

225
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
Let's go to Chengdongtou tomorrow

226
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,400
Try Wangfujing in Dongsi Archway

227
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,560
That will do

228
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,760
Blind cat kills mouse

229
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Take a chance

230
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
It's okay to go back

231
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,560
Jujube

232
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
Why are you pulling everything back again

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,840
Aunt, don't say it

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,760
It's annoying

235
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,880
This

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,880
None of them have been sold

237
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Those mountain products store owners

238
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,720
It is the same virtue as that surnamed Zhuang

239
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,120
Or say there is a fixed source of goods

240
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,120
Afraid of offending customers

241
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't accept my goods

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Or give that price

243
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,960
Lower than the one surnamed Zhuang

244
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,680
A black-hearted businessman

245
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
Talking about business in business

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
You can't blame all the shopkeepers

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
People have their own rules

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
Just because you broke the rules

249
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
Then what can I do about it

250
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,520
It's no big deal

251
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
I'll go to the east of the city tomorrow

252
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
Look for your next home again

253
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,400
Find the next home

254
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,160
If I were you

255
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,520
It's not that stupid

256
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
Third Brother

257
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm all bored here

258
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
You're not helping

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,200
Still talking sarcastic things there

260
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,560
I said

261
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Where am I going to be sarcastic

262
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
You won't admit what you just said

263
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,520
That line

264
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
You said I was stupid

265
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
It makes sense to call you stupid

266
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't be unconvinced

267
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,880
Row

268
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,360
Tell me the truth today

269
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,000
You don't say

270
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,080
You don't say it

271
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,800
I must be in a hurry with you

272
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
It's no use rushing with me

273
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,520
Think about it

274
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
You have the stock in your hand

275
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
Then you are the owner

276
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,120
If I were you

277
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Just take it to the street stall and sell it

278
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
Why am I looking for that mountain products shop

279
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Let those black-hearted bosses skin me again

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
You say you're not stupid. What are you

281
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,120
Right yeah yeah

282
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
I can make a lot of money by selling it directly

283
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,400
Third Brother

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm stupid and I'm simpleton

285
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,960
You really helped me this time

286
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,880
That is

287
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
Your third brother me

288
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
It also broke through Tianjin Wei Wharf

289
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
That helps the foreign comprador

290
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
Is the owner who has done big business

291
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,600
Don't mention your big deal, Suo Ye

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,240
You forgot that you were caught by the Communist Party selling fake medicines

293
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,280
You forgot that you were caught by the Communist Party selling fake medicines

294
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,680
Fourth brother, don't squeeze my third brother all the time

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
He really helped me this time

296
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,440
Don't take it seriously

297
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm playing with him

298
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
You say your third brother

299
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Serious things fail

300
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,880
This crooked way is a spirit

301
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
Sister, where can we set up a stall

302
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
We'll be right across from him

303
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,360
Right here

304
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,160
Good

305
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Good

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Put on

307
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,040
The brothers shouted hard for me

308
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,240
Louder voice

309
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Understand

310
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,160
Sister, just look at it

311
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
Vitex basket

312
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
Vitex basket

313
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,000
Basket

314
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
A basket dustpan

315
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,160
Strong and beautiful

316
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,240
It's not good to make it free of money

317
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,920
Everybody come and have a look

318
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
The basket dustpan is strong and beautiful

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
The boss does business against our door

320
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,000
Isn't this a challenge to us

321
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,160
At first glance, it is urgent

322
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,200
It's a little tender to fight with me

323
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
It's just made up and has the fragrance of Vitex negundo

324
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,800
Smell the fragrance

325
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
This basket is well woven

326
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,600
How do you sell it

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't ask me the price

328
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,400
Just go to the shop across the street and have a look

329
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,520
Let's see what they sell for

330
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
Everything we have here

331
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,280
They are 20% cheaper than the opposite side

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,160
Little girl, are you telling the truth

333
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,320
Can I lie to you

334
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,160
Why are you lying to me

335
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Have a look

336
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,400
Really

337
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Go to the opposite side

338
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,480
Go and go

339
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,000
Walk, walk

340
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,000
Look, boss

341
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,600
They didn't buy the basket on the stall named Tian

342
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
They all came to us

343
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
What did I say

344
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,520
Here comes the sale

345
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Vitex basket

346
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,000
What do you guys want to buy

347
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,280
Good-looking, durable and strong

348
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Don't go. Where are you going?

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,360
Come on, come on

350
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,520
Strong and durable

351
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,000
Strong and good-looking

352
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Is it all understood

353
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,080
Girl

354
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,440
Can you really make it cheap

355
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,680
It's really cheap

356
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,760
Get two baskets

357
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,400
Two baskets, please

358
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,640
I'll have two baskets and three baskets

359
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,440
Three baskets

360
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,360
Your money

361
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,320
Give me the money

362
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,160
You have

363
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,160
They went to that stall to buy it again

364
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,360
Go and see what's going on

365
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,600
Your money

366
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,400
Give me the money

367
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,320
That's enough for you

368
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,480
Bring me a basket. Bring me a basket

369
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,680
Come and give money. Give money

370
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
Give you the money

371
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,600
This quality is really good

372
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,760
Uncles and sisters

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,640
Uncles and sisters

374
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,880
You go back with your neighbors

375
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,680
Say hello to everyone

376
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,560
Understand, understand

377
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't worry, little girl

378
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll let the big guys buy it when I get back.

379
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Go on, go on, go on

380
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,680
Good good

381
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,000
Say hello, everyone

382
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,640
Good

383
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,120
Boss

384
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
What's going on

385
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,560
How do you run to the people who buy things at her stall

386
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,520
It's getting more and more

387
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,360
Don't mention it, boss

388
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
All the goods on their stall

389
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,640
They are 20% cheaper than ours

390
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,160
Two

391
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Vitex basket

392
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,760
Isn't this using me as a lamp

393
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,320
Isn't this obviously against us

394
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
Don't you blow her away

395
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,320
Blow away

396
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Do you know what Tian Zao does

397
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,800
She's a street activist

398
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,440
Is a big hit in the government

399
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,680
Follow her little brothers

400
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,840
All of them are wild children

401
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,080
On Fighting and Killing

402
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,920
Eight. Let's tie one

403
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,000
It's not one of theirs

404
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,120
Not that

405
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,800
Then we'll put up with it

406
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,840
Let's see again

407
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,480
What? Give you some money

408
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,680
What is this money for? You don't know in your heart

409
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,920
Jujube leader

410
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
This business is not bad

411
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,680
Be careful, everyone

412
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,600
You said you were standing by my door

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
Selling the same goods as me

414
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,600
Everything is cheaper than me

415
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you think it's appropriate

416
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,960
It is especially suitable for dealing with profiteers like you

417
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I don't understand

418
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,280
You leave good street activists out

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
Why do you have to come to me to do business

420
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,840
I don't sell baskets for myself

421
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
It is to donate money to volunteers to buy planes

422
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,120
Do you understand

423
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,560
Really

424
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
Ouch hello

425
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,880
You should have told me earlier

426
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,560
How can I offer you that price

427
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,680
How about this

428
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,560
How much more do you have there

429
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,160
Give it all to me

430
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm round

431
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll definitely give you a high price

432
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Now I know

433
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,800
Sorry to be late

434
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
Now no matter how high the price you offer,

435
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
Not as much as I earn by selling directly to customers

436
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,800
Send you two words

437
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Endure

438
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,960
Come on, guys

439
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,560
Go home

440
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,840
Go

441
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Go home

442
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Go

443
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Go

444
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Excuse me. Excuse me

445
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,200
Make way

446
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,680
Where did you go?

447
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,400
Go home. Don't send it

448
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
Bye-bye-bye

449
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's go

450
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,920
Go home

451
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,760
Who am I messing with

452
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,480
Don't mess with this aunt

453
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,840
Sell

454
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,440
Really

455
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,600
So many more

456
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,639
Jujube

457
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,799
I didn't do anything else this day

458
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,119
Jing helped you collect the basket

459
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,198
Old neighbors in this neighborhood

460
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,079
It's new

461
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,079
That's great

462
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,680
Take out those dates today

463
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,680
How are they selling

464
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,160
I sold all of them

465
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,439
Sure

466
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:38,520
How about jujube? Is your third brother good?

467
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Third brother, you are really good

468
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,960
Today is the day

469
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,280
Don't mention how happy it is

470
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,040
You didn't see the face of the surname Zhuang

471
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,800
It's all green

472
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,600
Want to take advantage of our dates

473
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,200
That guy just wants to die

474
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,720
Xiaofeng

475
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,360
Pull a few more cars tomorrow

476
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Why are you looking for so many cars

477
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,680
What for

478
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Let's sell it ourselves

479
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
When does it have to be sold before it is the head

480
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
Gather all the brothers together tomorrow

481
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
Go to various commercial streets

482
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
Put up a few more stalls to sell together

483
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,840
That's how fast it is

484
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,520
Do you understand

485
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,800
Sister, I see

486
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,160
I'm going to find the car

487
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,800
Go quickly

488
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,760
Jujube

489
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Me and Shirley and your uncle

490
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
Then I'll make it up for you at home

491
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,640
Make up one more and change one more money

492
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,400
Let's support the volunteers at the front line

493
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
Yes, that's it

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Everybody move

495
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,920
So that the plane of our volunteer soldiers

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
To fly to the sky early

497
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,120
Wait

498
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,840
Third brother, what are you going to do? Moth

499
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
Who knows what he has in mind

500
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,000
There are many ideas in one day

501
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,240
What about

502
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
There must be forty or fifty here

503
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,040
Boy

504
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,520
What is this

505
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,320
Jujube

506
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
Ming put this little flag

507
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
Insert it all on all stalls

508
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,520
That's good

509
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,160
Suo Ye

510
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,200
Your flag is wonderful

511
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,960
How is it

512
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,760
Third Brother

513
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,440
Ming, I carry your flag

514
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,280
My baskets are selling faster

515
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Have a good time, you

516
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,040
Not bad

517
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Charity sale for volunteers

518
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240
It's a charity sale

519
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,880
Donate aircraft for charity sale for volunteers to resist US aggression and aid Korea

520
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,480
Charity sale for volunteers

521
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,200
Donate airplanes for charity sale for volunteers

522
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,320
It's a charity sale

523
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,000
Charity sale for volunteers

524
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,600
Jujube really has you

525
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
You told me to weave Vitex baskets

526
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
To sell money and donate planes

527
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
I haven't taken it seriously yet

528
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
I didn't expect you to sell so much money

529
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
Sister Hongying, this is not my own credit

530
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
This is uncle and aunt

531
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,240
I helped make it up day and night

532
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
And they don't want money yet

533
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,240
So, I didn't donate this alone

534
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,680
This is the people in the neighborhood alley

535
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
A heart for the volunteers

536
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,640
Although I also know that

537
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,000
This money can't buy a plane either

538
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,000
But

539
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Can buy an airplane wheel

540
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,680
We are also satisfied

541
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,520
Mobilize the masses

542
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,120
It's street activists and grass-roots organizations

543
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,040
The most important work

544
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,080
Good jujube

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I want to live for you and all

546
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,320
Neighbors in the alley celebrate

547
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,160
This group of simple working people

548
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
It's so cute

549
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,240
Don't be stunned

550
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,120
Help me clean up quickly

551
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,520
Logarithmic number

552
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,040
Comrades

553
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,040
Beijing is a Korean volunteer soldier

554
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
The activity of donating aircraft

555
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,120
It is in full swing

556
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,160
With the efforts of the general public,

557
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,240
We have put the money we have raised

558
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,720
It was handed over to the Central Military Commission and the Volunteer Army Headquarters

559
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,720
I believe that in the near future

560
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,240
In the sky on the Korean battlefield

561
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,560
There are planes donated by us Beijingers

562
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,160
To beat the American imperialist aggressors

563
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,320
Good

564
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
Good

565
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
Since the volunteers entered the DPRK,

566
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,240
After five great battles

567
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,920
Has put American imperialism

568
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,760
And the U.N.

569
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,720
And the South Korean reactionaries

570
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,480
Back to the south of the 38th parallel

571
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
Our loveliest people in new China

572
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,760
Our great volunteer soldiers

573
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,920
Played military power and played national power

574
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,520
Since then, imperialism and its lackeys

575
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,840
Never underestimate us Chinese again

576
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
This is exactly what Chairman Mao said at the founding ceremony

577
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,240
The sentence you said standing on Tiananmen Gate

578
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,440
The Chinese people have stood up since then

579
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,760
Good

580
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Good good

581
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,040
Good good

582
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,640
Good

583
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Team leader, look

584
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,040
What new instructions does Shangfeng have

585
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
Let's persist in the struggle

586
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,960
Cooperate with the Party and the state to counterattack the mainland

587
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,800
And counterattack the mainland

588
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
Americans let the Communist Party

589
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I called back to the 38th parallel

590
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,120
Right, team leader

591
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,480
It was said before that the 52nd Army of the National Army

592
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Sent by the Americans to fight in Korea

593
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,800
Now even this matter is yellow

594
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,320
I see the Third World War

595
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,360
I can't fight anymore

596
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't be discouraged

597
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
The war is not over yet

598
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,920
We still have hope

599
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,880
Brother

600
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Americans are now with the Communist Party

601
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,640
Armistice negotiations

602
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
Don't dream about it

603
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,560
You'd better think about what we can do

604
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,320
What to do

605
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Continue to lurk

606
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Waiting for an opportunity

607
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
We must not let the Communist Party be stable

608
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,760
You'd better think about how we can be stable

609
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,960
For a while,

610
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
We let the Communist Party chase us like a duck

611
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,080
If you hadn't prepared in advance,

612
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,960
This hiding place

613
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,400
We have long been completely suppressed by the Communist Party

614
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,000
Rest assured

615
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
The Communist Party wants to hold me

616
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
They don't have that way yet

617
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,760
Besides

618
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,840
Who fought bloody battles with us in Peiping

619
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,080
There are so many elites in the party state

620
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,480
In addition

621
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,360
This Korean War has been going on for more than a year

622
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,040
We have developed a lot of comrades

623
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
With these people working together with us

624
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,160
Work with the Communist Party

625
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,680
I don't believe there's nothing going on

626
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Once we do a few beautiful jobs,

627
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,160
The party and the state will never forget us

628
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,920
Of the iron warriors on the mainland

629
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,480
Live and die

630
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,880
Go ahead, brother

631
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,360
What do we do next

632
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Let's do this

633
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,960
Comrades

634
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,280
Since the victory of the fifth battle,

635
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,200
Both sides of the enemy and me in the Korean battlefield

636
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,600
A stalemate stage was formed on the 38th parallel

637
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,880
What about in a short time

638
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
There will be no large-scale battle

639
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,280
Because volunteers are not afraid of suffering and death,

640
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,960
Waged a heroic and extraordinary battle

641
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,400
Put American imperialism

642
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,080
The arrogance of its running dogs was destroyed

643
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,360
In order to cooperate with the Korean battlefield,

644
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,640
The Ministry of Public Security issued an order

645
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,120
On a national scale

646
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,680
Thoroughly eliminate the consistent Taoist and good society

647
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
Religious Philosophy Research Society

648
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,680
Bai Lian Jiao Zi Xia Jiao Sheng Xian Dao III Pu Du

649
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,760
These seven have a wide range of influences

650
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Reactionary secret society organization

651
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,320
What about the last stage

652
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,760
According to Comrade Sun Tie's investigation of Beijing

653
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,440
The leader of the reactionary secret society organization

654
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Participation in the activities of enemy spy organizations

655
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,840
We have arrested a number of key suspects

656
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,480
What about this stage

657
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,120
It's time to expand the results

658
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,520
The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order

659
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,360
From now on

660
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,240
All police officers in Beijing

661
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
In the whole city

662
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,880
Eradicate reactionary secret society organizations

663
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
Put these smoky remnants

664
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Sweep away

665
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
Give it back to the people of Beijing

666
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,280
A clean hot land

667
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Good

668
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
Comrades

669
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,880
The main tasks of our second department

670
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Is to use this operation

671
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,680
Find the spy code-named Night Wolf

672
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,440
Zheng Qiang's whereabouts

673
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,360
Be arrested

674
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,720
At the same time, all the spies lurking in Beijing

675
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Are uprooted

676
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,400
Completely wipe out

677
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,400
Yes

678
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Don't move

679
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,600
Stop and don't move

680
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,240
Don't move

681
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,400
Be honest. Don't move. Don't move

682
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,560
And here

683
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,040
Arrest this

684
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,720
Walk

685
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,560
Are you all right, uncle

686
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,120
Everybody put it in custody. Put it in custody

687
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,320
Take away take away

688
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,840
Go

689
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,200
Where did it hurt

690
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,080
I hurt my head

691
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,960
Good good

692
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,800
Good good

693
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,240
Good good

694
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,960
Tell the big guy a good news

695
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,920
American devils on the Korean battlefield now

696
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,360
Has been our volunteer soldiers

697
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,480
Be scared by beating

698
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,480
Beg for mercy

699
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
There have been armistice negotiations now

700
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,400
Good good

701
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,560
Now all Beijing is donating money for us

702
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,280
Buying planes for volunteers

703
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
It has been successfully concluded

704
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,400
I represent the district government

705
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,240
Express my gratitude to everyone

706
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
During this time, day and night

707
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,080
Weave baskets and baskets with my Tian Zao

708
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,400
Thank you all

709
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Hard work, everyone

710
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,640
Jujube is not hard at all

711
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,960
This is what we big guys should do

712
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
Isn't it

713
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,960
Is

714
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,280
Jujube is in the sky of the Korean battlefield

715
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,000
You can see the plane we donated

716
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,440
Fight American devils

717
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,800
Aunt, you have to watch carefully

718
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,840
There must be some in this day

719
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,120
Good

720
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
That's great

721
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Good

722
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,800
There is no news from other aspects

723
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,600
It's gone

724
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,400
Chief of Section

725
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,360
Xiao Sun

726
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,280
What happened

727
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,320
In the Drum Tower and Shichahai

728
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,520
Found the trail of Zheng Qiang

729
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,120
Are you sure

730
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,160
Determine

731
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,200
We interrogated a captured man

732
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
Consistent Taoist

733
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
According to him

734
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
He met Zheng Qiang in Shichahai area

735
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,240
And he himself

736
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Is under the instructions of Zheng Qiang's third child

737
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,480
Participating in the consistent road

738
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,840
In the process of communicating with the third child,

739
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,880
He said that the third child once mentioned it

740
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,520
The approximate location of Zheng Qiang

741
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,200
You are like this

742
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Quickly notify Director Lin of Shichahai segment

743
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,600
Ask him to send more people to help us with the investigation

744
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,400
Just find a place to stay in Zheng Qiang

745
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,120
Arrest him at once

746
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm familiar with the team leader

747
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm going to find Director Lin now

748
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,480
Good

749
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,200
Xiao Sun

750
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,000
This Zheng Qiang is very cunning

751
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,400
And he is a native of Beijing

752
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
And lurking in Beijing for a long time

753
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,240
Underground activities

754
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
Very familiar with the ground in Beijing

755
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,160
So you must pay attention to confidentiality

756
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
You can't startle the snake

757
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,560
Let him get away again

758
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Understand

759
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
It is basically certain that

760
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,880
How's Director Lam going

761
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,480
Make progress

762
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,880
According to our analysis

763
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Found out several Zheng Qiang

764
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,400
Possible lurking place

765
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,280
We are preparing for the next film

766
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,120
Make a thorough investigation of these areas

767
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,360
At present, what about the whole city

768
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,560
Are checking the spies

769
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,720
I believe Zheng Qiang is already frightened at this time

770
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,080
Any trouble

771
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,960
Could have alerted him

772
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,840
Your people are fresh faces

773
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,080
If you appear rashly in these areas,

774
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,480
It is very likely to arouse his suspicion

775
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,920
I suggest

776
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,880
Dapeng is still responsible for keeping the bottom line

777
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,160
Good

778
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,600
All right

779
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,280
Dapeng

780
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,920
Although your police station came forward,

781
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It won't appear too abrupt

782
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,000
But after all, you are policemen

783
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
It is also possible to startle the snake

784
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,160
So you go to the red tassel

785
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,360
Let her start street activists

786
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,800
Organize the surrounding people

787
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
Let them find clues about Zheng Qiang

788
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:06,960
Good

789
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
I'll find Sister Hong Ying right away

790
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,400
After reading the jujube, please circulate it to everyone

791
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,320
Comrades

792
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,320
The man in the photo is the Kuomintang Secret Service

793
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,560
Zheng Qiang, a big spy lurking in Beijing

794
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,000
Code name Night Wolf

795
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,120
Go fast

796
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,120
Come on, you

797
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,800
Walk, walk

798
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
Go fast

799
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,760
Make way, make way, make way

800
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,160
Where are the iron eggs

801
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,040
Chase

802
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,000
Go

803
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,560
According to reliable information

804
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,400
At present, this person is likely

805
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,560
Lurking in our area

806
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Within the jurisdiction

807
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,360
You are all from our area

808
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,440
Street activists

809
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,280
From now on

810
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,560
You're going to tell your segment

811
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,600
Visit from house to house

812
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,600
Find the trail of this Zheng Qiang

813
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,600
Sister, you can rest assured

814
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
As long as this man is here

815
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,720
We can definitely find out for him

816
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I believe that

817
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,880
But everyone must pay attention

818
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,800
During this door-to-door visit,

819
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,520
Don't show any flaws

820
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,520
Because this man has strong anti-detection ability

821
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,640
Once he found out and alarmed him,

822
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,400
Let him get away

823
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,240
Trying to catch him again

824
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,960
That would be difficult

825
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,520
Director

826
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
Now our job is to

827
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
Go door to door

828
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Have a chat with the neighbors

829
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,840
See what difficulties they have in their lives

830
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Then there is to see

831
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,080
What do they don't understand about the policy

832
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
That's what we do at the same time

833
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,080
That's why I'm looking for you

834
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,200
Everyone will work normally

835
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,560
How to do it at ordinary times and how to do it now

836
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,000
There will be no flaws

837
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,360
But during the visit,

838
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,960
Everyone must keep an eye on it

839
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Once something unusual is found,

840
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,680
Report to me at once

841
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,760
Just look at it

842
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Let me emphasize it to you again

843
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,240
Find an abnormal situation

844
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,680
Come and report to me at once

845
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,680
Never act without authorization

846
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,120
Because these agents carry guns with them

847
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
Don't confront them head-on

848
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,560
First, we must protect ourselves

849
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,760
Second, it must not be involved

850
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
Innocent people

851
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,400
Aunt Li

852
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,920
Go back and forth and put it here

853
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,720
Right, put it here

854
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,600
By the way, aunt

855
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,600
Have you seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood recently

856
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
I haven't found it recently

857
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,920
That's okay

858
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,960
Be careful, be careful

859
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,680
Come

860
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,440
Stack on

861
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,360
Thanks, thanks, thanks

862
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,120
Thank you for the volunteers

863
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,920
Come on, come on

864
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,120
Come

865
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,160
By the way, aunt

866
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,120
Have you been around recently

867
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
See anyone suspicious

868
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,160
No

869
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,560
That's fine. It's okay

870
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,240
Let's go

871
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Thank you thank you

872
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,640
Haven't seen anyone suspicious around lately, have you

873
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,960
Haven't found it recently

874
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,640
No, ah

875
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
Then go back. Go back

876
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Aunt

877
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,120
Who is this family

878
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
Why don't you open the door in broad daylight

879
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,240
There seems to be no one in this family

880
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,640
It always closes the door all the year round

881
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,280
Walk

882
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,160
Jujube is coming

883
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,639
Yeah

884
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,040
I came to see you give volunteers

885
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,920
Have you finished all the bedding and shoes

886
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:22,880
It's already done

887
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,600
Just waiting for you to collect it

888
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,000
Hurry up

889
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:27,120
By the way, aunt

890
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,319
When I just passed the courtyard next door,

891
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,040
See an old man

892
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Look at the eyes and panic

893
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:32,480
I haven't seen it on the street at ordinary times

894
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,199
Who is he

895
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,719
You mean the old housekeeper in the courtyard

896
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,040
Housekeeper

897
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,400
What old housekeeper

898
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,720
Is an old servant

899
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,759
Where are the people in their courtyard

900
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,720
Don't come out very often

901
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,080
Occasionally I met in the street

902
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,159
I don't like to talk to people

903
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:45,120
Have a good share of students

904
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,839
Then who lives in that courtyard

905
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:00,680
I visited several hutongs from house to house

906
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,520
According to the clues provided by the neighbors,

907
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,600
I found that these two courtyards are a little abnormal

908
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Old Qin

909
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,160
Immediately put the household registration files of these two courtyards

910
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,920
Bring it out

911
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,720
Yes

912
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
Qin Defu is now in charge of household registration files in the branch office

913
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
There are some situations that he knows better

914
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,000
Director Lin, this is the file

915
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,240
Secretary Lam

916
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,360
We have all done household surveys in this small courtyard

917
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,320
According to the materials provided in the file

918
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,440
What about this small courtyard

919
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,880
It belongs to a Kuomintang officer before liberation

920
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,040
Before the uprising in Fu Zuoyi, he

921
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,080
I flew to the south

922
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,160
So the yard is empty

923
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
Has been uninhabited

924
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
It's the neighbors who said it

925
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,120
This small courtyard is indeed empty

926
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,200
No one ever lived there

927
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
Old Qin, go on and say

928
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,760
Look again

929
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,400
There is only one family in this small courtyard

930
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,960
The family's surname is Zhai

931
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
He was a teacher before liberation

932
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,840
Well-to-do family

933
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,360
And now

934
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,200
When I was old, I started to live in the public

935
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
With a servant from my hometown

936
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
Usually at home, that is, writing, drawing and reading books

937
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,000
Because this person has a little ink in his stomach,

938
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,400
Compare lofty

939
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,320
I usually don't say hello to my neighbors

940
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,160
Has been living in seclusion

941
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,200
I've seen the old servant

942
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,960
You've seen him

943
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
So what did he say to you

944
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,360
I told him I was from the district government

945
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,640
Come door-to-door to collect materials to resist US aggression and aid Korea

946
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
Then he went back without saying anything

947
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,400
After a while

948
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I took out two calligraphy and paintings

949
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,880
Said his master said

950
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,920
Give this calligraphy and painting to the volunteers

951
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
Then he went back and closed the door

952
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,720
I asked my neighbors about it again

953
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,360
It is said that they don't show up very much at ordinary times

954
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,520
Occasionally I met in the street

955
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,440
I don't get to know each other very much

956
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,080
The evaluation of them is that they are unsocial

957
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,960
What do you think of iron eggs

958
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,240
These two courtyards are single-family

959
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,480
If I were Zheng Qiang,

960
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,040
These two places are ideal hiding places

961
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,200
Now that this goal has been roughly determined,

962
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Then we'll act at night

963
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,960
Assault these two courtyards

964
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,200
Arrest Zheng Qiang

965
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,160
Good

966
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I'll go back and implement it to Chief Gao

967
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,280
Red tassel

968
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,640
What about before this arrest

969
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,600
You have to work hard to organize the masses

970
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
Surveillance of these two courtyards

971
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,680
Once you find out what's going on

972
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,840
Let me know immediately

973
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,440
Don't worry, I'll arrange it

974
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,680
Xiao Dongzi

975
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,240
Did you find anything from your mother

976
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,840
Sister Zao, my mother asked me to tell you

977
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,680
They are in the back wall of this yard, over the alley

978
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,840
I've been staring for most of the day

979
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,920
There is no movement

980
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,360
Okay, you go back and tell your mother that they

981
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,680
Let them keep an eye on it

982
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,520
Don't miss anything

983
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:09,960
Do you understand

984
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,400
Good

985
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
Comrades split up

986
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,680
Yes

987
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
You guys are kind of here

988
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,520
Is there any movement

989
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
Since coming out of the meeting,

990
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
We've been here watching

991
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,760
There are people in the front, back, left and right sides of this hospital

992
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,680
But so far

993
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,560
There was no movement

994
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,520
And no one came in or out

995
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,240
Tian Zao, your mission is over

996
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,480
Quick withdrawal

997
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
But I also

998
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,520
Execute a command

999
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,680
Go

1000
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,600
Action

1001
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,960
Upper

1002
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,200
Quickly

1003
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,440
Search

1004
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,120
This way

1005
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,640
Good

1006
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,080
What are you guys doing

1007
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,000
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau

1008
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,240
Be honest

1009
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Nobody

1010
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,000
No

1011
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,400
No

1012
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:32,960
No

1013
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,120
No

1014
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,760
Search carefully again

1015
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,560
See if there are any traces of people living

1016
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,320
Yes

1017
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,640
Captain

1018
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
It seems that someone has lived in this house

1019
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
And there is more than one person

1020
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,240
You report to the team leader

1021
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,000
Others search

1022
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,800
Yes

1023
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,440
Who live in this courtyard

1024
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
Just me and my servant

1025
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,800
Is it

1026
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,920
It's absolutely true

1027
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,280
Chief of the report, there is no one in the East Room

1028
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,640
But there are traces of life

1029
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Someone must have lived there

1030
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,920
Report Leader

1031
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,600
Traces of people living in the south house were also found

1032
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,280
Westinghouse also has it

1033
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,560
The two of you

1034
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,680
Is there a room for four

1035
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,840
I live in the main room

1036
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,480
My servant lives in the south room

1037
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
What about two rooms

1038
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,680
East and west rooms. That's the guest room

1039
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,520
My relatives and friends came to see me

1040
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Stay there once in a while

1041
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,160
Totally nonsense

1042
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,800
We monitor your yard

1043
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,800
It's been a long time

1044
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,680
Except for the two of you coming in and out

1045
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,120
No one has been in or out

1046
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Who else is hidden in this courtyard

1047
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,320
Where are they

1048
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,280
Team leader found something

1049
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,360
Stare at

1050
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,960
Yes

1051
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,400
Team leader

1052
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,440
Look at this mark

1053
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,560
There

1054
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,520
Radio station
