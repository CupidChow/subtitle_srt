1
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,240
There

2
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Radio station

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,200
What is this

4
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,920
The surname Zhai

5
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
If you confess now

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
It can also be regarded as your meritorious service

7
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
What else are you going to face

8
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,480
You know better than I do

9
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,880
I said

10
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,160
I'll say it all

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Say

12
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,160
This yard except for the two of us

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
There are three other people living there

14
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Which three men

15
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
The leader is Zheng Qiang

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,520
His deputy is called Lao San

17
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
There is also a white flour scholar

18
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,760
White flour scholar

19
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,560
What's it called

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,960
Sir, I really don't know his name

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
I knew it

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,360
He is responsible for receiving and sending telegrams in the house every day

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
This place is

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,120
Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,360
A secret liaison station set up

26
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,280
Send me to stay at the liaison station

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
In case of emergency

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,360
Where's Zheng Qiangren

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,560
Zheng Qiang, the three of them

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,240
Came to me last month with a radio station

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
Tell me

32
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,800
To enable this secret contact station

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,680
Since they hit here,

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,440
Has been lurking in the courtyard

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Never go out

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,480
Me and my servant

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,320
Be responsible for their daily supplies

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
And eating and drinking every day

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,960
It's getting dark today

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,440
Zheng Qiang seems to have got some news

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,560
The three of them hurried

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Leave with the radio station

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,440
They left in a great hurry

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Ordered me when he left

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
Keep lurking here

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't tell anyone you've seen them

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,720
It is impossible

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,120
All our people around here are staring

49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,040
No one has seen Zheng Qiang leave

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,000
Sir

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Zheng Qiang has already chosen the evacuation route

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
He didn't walk through the front door

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
I didn't escape from the backyard over the wall

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
Where did he run from

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Two officers

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,760
You guys come with me

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,960
That's where they went up to the roof

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
Leaving along the roof

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,280
How can it be so coincidental

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,640
A few hours before the arrest of Zheng Qiang,

61
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,480
He ran away early with the radio station

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Go back to the station

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
We are interested in Zhai and his servants

64
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
A further interrogation was conducted

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,640
What they say

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
It is basically consistent with what is told at the scene

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,960
It is basically consistent with what is told at the scene

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Looks like that's all they know

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
According to the surname Zhai,

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,280
Before Zheng Qiang left,

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,760
What message did you receive

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Caused him to run away in a hurry

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
So who sent him the message

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,520
This Zhai said

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,760
Before that,

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,600
Ever since Zheng Qiang entered this yard,

77
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,040
I never went out again

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,920
And

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,040
No one has ever been to this yard

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,240
Then what channel did they go through

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
What about the message delivered

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
Lao Wu Xiao Sun

83
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,200
When you searched the yard,

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Have you found any homing pigeons

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,080
No

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
I thought about this before

87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,560
If the enemy passes through homing pigeons,

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
If you pass a message,

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,320
The owner of this family

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,880
There must be traces of raising pigeons

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
But there is no such thing

92
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,400
And Zhai said

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
They never had pigeons

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,800
Like cats and dogs

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
None of these animals have ever been raised

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,760
Could the enemy have gone through the radio

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Messages delivered

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Let's not talk about this

99
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,960
Don't be depressed, everyone

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,320
Lao Wu is like this

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,800
What do you think of Zhai

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,760
And his servants

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Further interrogation

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
See if you can find any new clues

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes

106
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Xiao Sun

107
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,160
You and Director Lin and Dapeng

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
You have further expanded your search

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Try to find Zheng Qiang's escape route

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,800
Good

111
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,680
There is another important situation

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,360
There is another important situation

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,400
What happened

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,800
That's what Lao Wu just asked

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,960
It is impossible for the enemy to pass the radio station

116
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
Send a message to Zheng Qiang

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,240
Because according to the comrades of the electrical investigation team,

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,120
Findings of the survey

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,520
At that time

120
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,360
There is no radio station in the whole area

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
Any message received

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
If you say so, then

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
How did the enemy give Zheng Qiang

124
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,120
What about the tippers

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't care now

126
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
How did they tip off

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,520
What I want to ask is that

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,960
Who is the man who tipped off Zheng Qiang

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
How did he know

130
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,720
We'll catch Zheng Qiang at night

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,560
Chief Gao

132
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,120
Are you suspecting that we have a lurking spy inside

133
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,360
Know that we are going to arrest Zheng Qiang

134
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,200
There is this action

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,480
I tipped him off in advance

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,160
In addition

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Is there any other explanation

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
But the problem is

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
Know this situation

140
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
There are not many people, are there

141
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
I knew it anyway

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
The four of us here

143
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
It can never be a traitor

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,240
It is impossible to send any message to Zheng Qiang

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
Except for the four of us

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,880
Anyone who knows and participates in this matter

147
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,880
It's all questionable

148
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,400
That's why I left you guys behind

149
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
The focus of our future work

150
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,600
First, continue to arrest Zheng Qiang

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Second, secretly investigate

152
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,520
Find out the spies lurking inside us

153
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
Dog spy

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,920
What's the matter, jujube

155
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
You asked me to arrange street activists

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,080
And the neighbors guard the courtyard

157
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
Guard the front door and back wall

158
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
I didn't expect him to run off the roof

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,560
Jujube

160
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,840
The spy is particularly cunning

161
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,879
It's so dark again

162
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,399
They ran off the roof

163
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,040
How can you possibly see

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
Don't blame yourself

165
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,400
You have done a good job

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,480
Dog spy

167
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,640
According to our current summary,

168
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,640
The radio station in charge of Zheng Qiang

169
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,080
It is the most active among many enemy stations

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,560
Have close ties with the Taiwan authorities

171
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,760
We are now in the citywide

172
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
Search for the enemy station

173
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,480
What about the clue

174
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
Can you lock the location of this radio station at present

175
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Our present equipment is really backward

176
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,280
It is very difficult to lock the position of this radio station

177
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,080
Section chief

178
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm interested in this time

179
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,200
City Bureau Action Team participating in the operation

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,520
A comprehensive investigation was conducted

181
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,400
All police officers are selected at different levels

182
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,640
Innocent in origin

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,560
There is no suspicion of spy

184
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,560
So

185
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,160
The spy who tipped off Zheng Qiang this time

186
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,560
It can't be our city bureau

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,880
Police officers involved in the operation

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Lao Lin, what about your situation

189
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,720
Chief Gao

190
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,520
The situation on our side is very complicated

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
Because from the beginning,

192
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
We used the district office

193
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
Street activists organized

194
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,080
That piece was checked

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Comrade Tian Zao and other activists

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
Know the mission of our operation

197
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,440
Plus the area where Zheng Qiang lives

198
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680
The surrounding people

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,560
It is also possible to tip off

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,120
In addition

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,440
The police officer who participated in the arrest at the branch office

202
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,720
And we know the mission of our operation

203
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
There is also the household registration department of the branch office

204
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,360
When reading and monitoring the files of the small courtyard,

205
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
Lao Qin and his comrades in the household registration department

206
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,160
I also know that we want to catch Zheng Qiang

207
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,680
Among such a large group of people,

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,600
Looking for this lurking spy

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to finish it in a short time

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,280
How could so many people know

211
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
You said Zheng Qiang at that time

212
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
Once appeared in Shichahai

213
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
Then such a large-scale investigation

214
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,400
Can the four of us find it

215
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,080
Besides

216
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,240
We don't provide this photo of Zheng Qiang

217
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
And his situation

218
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,360
The common people know who we are looking for

219
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
That clue can't be found

220
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,720
Lao Lin has a point

221
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,040
Such an arrest

222
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,520
It is impossible to be foolproof in secrecy

223
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,160
Seems

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,800
Inventory internal agents

225
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
The task is very arduous

226
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
But no matter how difficult it is, we must carry on the work

227
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
But what about the current focus of our work

228
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,120
Or should I put it on the enemy radio station

229
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,240
Come up in the direction of arresting Zheng Qiang

230
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,800
According to the comrades of the electrical investigation team,

231
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,680
This radio station in charge of Zheng Qiang

232
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,440
It's a spy lurking in Beijing

233
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,320
Important radio stations in contact with the Taiwan authorities

234
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,920
So we must find it

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,920
After liberation

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
Underground radio stations in Beijing

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
There is not a day when I stop my activities

238
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
We also caught a lot

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
But there are still many radio stations

240
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,360
Have contact with the Taiwan authorities

241
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
To find Zheng Qiang among these radio stations

242
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm afraid it's more difficult

243
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
Our city bureau has moved from the Soviet Union

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,520
Introduced a radio direction finding car

245
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,160
A citywide search has been started

246
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,360
Find the radio station

247
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,520
You can find Zheng Qiang

248
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,360
This period of time

249
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
Did the direction finder find any clues

250
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,680
The buildings in Beijing are too complicated and there are many metal objects

251
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
Plus the big brother of the Soviet Union

252
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,880
The direction finding car provided to us is rather old

253
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,200
Although this time,

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
A preliminary investigation was made in the whole city

255
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Some enemy spy radio stations were also acquired

256
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,040
But the radio station in charge of Zheng Qiang

257
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
There is no clue

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Good

259
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Lanzi, try this meat

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
Come on, come on, let me clip it for you

261
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
Your uncle congratulates you

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
This, this, this

263
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
What are you congratulating on

264
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,600
No, no, no

265
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,440
You are not a street food stall

266
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,400
The hutongs are strung together

267
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,920
Return to one's old job

268
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,960
The chef of Dongfenglou Restaurant is serious

269
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,040
That's a famous restaurant in Beijing

270
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,840
The shopkeeper of that restaurant has visited your uncle several times

271
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,880
It was a war-torn country before liberation

272
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,080
All the people who came to dinner were dignitaries and stragglers

273
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Smash restaurants at every turn

274
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Your uncle doesn't feel that way

275
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,480
Unwilling to serve those people

276
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,160
Yes

277
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,840
You said that after liberation,

278
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,520
It's really different

279
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
You said that the market is peaceful now

280
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,320
People live and work in peace and contentment

281
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,040
There is spare cash for eating out here

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,360
I should be invited by this shopkeeper

283
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,840
Cook for our common people

284
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,920
Anyway

285
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
Can't spoil my craft

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,600
Do you think so

287
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,600
Wait for what day

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,400
I take Chunxi and small coal cores with me

289
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Come to your place and taste your cooking

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,760
I also told you that Suo Ye

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,680
If you want to eat, I'll cook it for you at home

292
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,440
Spend this money in eating out

293
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
You're sick

294
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,920
This is really

295
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Eat at home and eat out

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,400
Can it do the same thing

297
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,040
Dad, you don't understand when I say this

298
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
What does Brother Suo mean

299
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
Isn't he going to put a score in front of Sister Chunxi

300
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
I said Suo Ye

301
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
When will you and Chunxi get married

302
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,720
Right

303
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,360
This joy has already promised me

304
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,040
Just in time

305
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Their factory is not busy recently either

306
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
Soon, soon

307
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,040
Then Brother Suo, we have to congratulate you in advance

308
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,640
Don't you just congratulate me

309
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,320
Let me ask you something

310
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,640
When will you change your mind

311
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
Call uncles and aunts parents

312
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,360
I said

313
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,080
Why is Brother Suo old and not serious

314
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,320
What I said is more serious than anything else

315
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
Can you eat and drink

316
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,840
Line line line

317
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,560
I said I said

318
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,800
Mom and Dad

319
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,640
This

320
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,680
No, no, no, this, this, you, this, you

321
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,320
Silly Dapeng, sit down

322
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
You sit you sit you sit

323
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,000
I said I'll give you a pole

324
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,160
Just climb up

325
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,920
This is called Mom and Dad

326
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm telling you

327
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
Want to marry our big sister

328
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,440
That requires three media and six hiring

329
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
The dowry is ready

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,360
Pick up our big sister with respect and respect

331
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,800
Do you know

332
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,520
It's time to call mom and dad now

333
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
How can there be such a cheap thing

334
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,560
Is it a big sister

335
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,960
You have been left alone to speak both inside and outside

336
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Just eat quickly

337
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,960
I can't stop your mouth yet

338
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Come on, come on, come on, come on

339
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,080
I'm from my mother's family. I think more

340
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,520
Have you heard from Zheng Qiang yet

341
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,120
Now Zheng Qiang has become a frightened bird

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's getting deeper and deeper

343
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,280
It's really hard to catch him

344
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,360
Some time ago, Sister Hong Ying and Director Lin

345
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,920
Are investigating who tipped off Zheng Qiang

346
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,360
I also put the neighbors who know the news

347
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,440
There are also activists who have observed it

348
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
There are no suspicious people

349
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,240
The situation is still very complicated

350
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Although in the powerful operation of arresting spies,

351
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,920
And the suppression of counter-revolutionaries

352
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,360
Many sleeper agents have been arrested

353
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,520
But agents like Zheng Qiang

354
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,639
Instead, it is lurking deeper and deeper

355
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,199
Jujube

356
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,479
You work at the grass-roots level

357
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,640
Is the front line

358
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,320
You mustn't let your guard down

359
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,000
The strings in my mind must be stretched

360
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Protect yourself

361
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,320
I know. Do you still have to say that

362
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,800
That's right

363
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Dapeng went to Xiulan's house for dinner again today

364
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
I guess two people should be getting married soon

365
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,680
How nice

366
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
That's not thanks

367
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,280
Are you a big matchmaker

368
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,680
Men are affectionate and women are intentional

369
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
Cucumber looks at mung bean

370
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,040
Two people have eyes on each other

371
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,360
I'm just pulling a line and building a bridge

372
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Jujube, look at it

373
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,320
Dapeng and Xiulan are going to get married

374
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,320
Suo Ye and Chunxi Sister are also going to get married

375
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
There are also Director Lin and Sister Hong Ying

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,520
In fact, their superiors have already allowed them to get married

377
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
After the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea began,

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,080
I was delayed because I was too busy

379
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,320
You see, this is three pairs

380
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,960
Three pairs of good things are near

381
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,640
You said we should join them in a pile

382
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,920
How nice it would be to get a four-happy door

383
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,080
Think beautifully of you

384
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,560
Why do I join in this excitement with them

385
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,640
Besides, if you get married, you have to have children

386
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,520
How much it takes to have children to delay my work

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,640
No

388
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,080
Then Communist Party members have to get married and have children

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,880
Live your life

390
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,160
I haven't seen any married Communist Party members

391
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
It will affect the work

392
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,800
You talk about party members

393
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,120
Iron egg

394
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
I have told Sister Hong Ying that I want to join the party

395
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,720
Sister Hongying also agrees

396
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,400
Be my party introducer

397
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,040
At present, the party organization is inspecting me

398
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
Why don't you do it like this

399
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,000
When I really become

400
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,560
The day when the Communist Party of China was a member

401
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,320
We'll get married

402
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,440
Not dates

403
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,200
Why did you change your mind again

404
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
When did you apply to join the Party

405
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,920
And don't tell me

406
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,760
That line

407
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,360
Then this is the last time

408
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
Never change your mind again

409
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
You have to work hard

410
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm waiting for you to join the party

411
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,680
Then we'll get married

412
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,800
I will

413
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
We'll go back to the office later

414
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Re-order the whole one just now

415
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
See what other message lines can be found

416
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,800
Sun Tie

417
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,720
Sister Wu

418
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,680
What are you looking for me for

419
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
You haven't received the subsidy this month yet

420
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,600
I told you several times that you didn't get it

421
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,880
Are you too rich

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,480
Don't care

423
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,040
My sister Wu

424
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,760
I, I forgot this busy job

425
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,080
Go, go, I'll take it with you

426
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,920
You count

427
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,480
Don't count

428
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
There is still something wrong with this

429
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,240
It's better to count the money in person

430
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,160
That's right

431
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Sign one's name

432
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,040
Go, Sister Wu

433
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,560
Good

434
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
Chief, this is what the comrades handed in

435
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,800
Catch the clue of spy

436
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,120
It seems that comrades are very enthusiastic

437
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,000
Of course

438
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,160
Everyone wants to catch more spies

439
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,680
Come in

440
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,240
Xiao Sun

441
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,760
Chief of Section

442
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,240
I have a new idea

443
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
So urgent

444
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,440
Don't worry, sit down and talk slowly

445
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,240
I think so

446
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
Latent agents like Beijing

447
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,080
They organized so many sabotage operations

448
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,200
Then someone has to have a gun

449
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,400
If you have any ideas, just say it

450
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,160
Team leader, think about it

451
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
That organizer has to spend money

452
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,280
Where did they get the money for their activities

453
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,360
That makes sense

454
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,520
How many years have it been liberated

455
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
Even if the original spy had it

456
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,720
There are funds for some activities

457
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,480
It should have been spent almost

458
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,960
You see, guns cost money

459
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
Organizing spies costs money

460
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,840
He also needs money for the daily expenses of the spies

461
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,600
This is a big expense

462
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Where does the money come from

463
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,160
Check

464
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
Check with Hong Kong and overseas

465
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,240
Banks in Beijing with exchange relations

466
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,320
Focus on those related to Hong Kong

467
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Understand

468
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,760
Easy to walk

469
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,600
Coal-loving nucleus

470
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,400
If you want to eat today, order it

471
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,720
How expensive it is to eat in such a big restaurant

472
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
The chef of this restaurant is my uncle

473
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
His cooking is delicious

474
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,040
I want to eat, too

475
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,080
Is

476
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,520
Don't love money

477
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,360
Your brother I have money now

478
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,280
Rich

479
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,320
Just the little money you earn

480
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,480
It's not enough for you

481
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,320
I'll let you spend it before the end of the month

482
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,480
Scold the cook when you are full, don't you

483
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,960
Then I didn't spend it on anyone else

484
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
Don't you let the three of us eat and drink

485
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,040
Right

486
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,840
Comrade Suo

487
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
Come to me today and have something to eat

488
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,920
We are here to join you today

489
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
What about you? Let's see how many are matched

490
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Be good at delicious food

491
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,640
Get a good trip

492
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,120
I'll do it for you now

493
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,800
Get it

494
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,200
Don't save your money, uncle

495
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,040
You can rest assured

496
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,120
Don't save you money yet

497
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,320
How dare you say it

498
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,240
That's yeah

499
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,920
Remember the coal core

500
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,960
You can't fall anything when you fall

501
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Xiao Sun and I organized manpower separately

502
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,840
Go to Beijing and Hong Kong and overseas

503
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,080
All the banks with exchange business have checked it

504
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
I even checked the banks in the outer suburbs

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,320
No suspicious remittance was found

506
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,480
No

507
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,680
I can't believe it

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,960
The Taiwan authorities

509
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
Want to provide funds for spies lurking in Beijing

510
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,840
It can only be through remittance

511
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
If they want to send money

512
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,160
Taiwan should go through the radio

513
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,800
Tell the lurking agents to withdraw money

514
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,040
Xiao Li

515
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,800
You organize people immediately

516
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Re-read what we listened to

517
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,480
Contents of all enemy radio stations

518
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,960
Focus on telegrams related to money

519
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,080
Lao Wu Xiao Sun

520
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,720
You two also help to check

521
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,880
Yes yes

522
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,840
How is it

523
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,080
Your uncle's craft is authentic, isn't it

524
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,680
Don't say it's delicious

525
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,800
Brother Suo

526
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,960
I tasted the dish

527
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,440
Why is it different from the taste made by your uncle at home

528
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
How fresh it is

529
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
Your uncle's head

530
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,800
Do you have such good chicken, duck and fish

531
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,840
At best, I'll cook you a cabbage and add some meat

532
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,480
That oil has to be saved

533
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,640
Do you understand

534
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,200
That's true

535
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,200
You said

536
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,360
This ordinary family

537
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,000
How can you afford such good materials

538
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
So say it

539
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,440
If you want to eat well, you have to eat out

540
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,200
How doe it taste

541
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,160
It's delicious. Thank you, uncle

542
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,120
Just taste good

543
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
Even if you're not busy in vain

544
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,640
Isn't that enough

545
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,680
No, I can't. I'll match two more

546
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
Enough already

547
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
The main reason is that this coal core can be eaten

548
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,240
Brother Suo didn't eat less either

549
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,840
Just like your sister

550
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,760
Beat the monk after reading the scriptures, don't you

551
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,640
Coal core

552
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,400
Half a big boy eats Laozi to death

553
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,360
Now it's time to grow up

554
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,040
You have to catch delicious food and eat it hard

555
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,760
Do you know

556
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,040
Uncle De Gui

557
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,400
Satisfied with wine and food

558
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,760
Please check out. Where are you

559
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
Actually, you said this meal

560
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,120
I'll do it. You won't do it for sure

561
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,000
This way

562
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,360
I made a deal with the shopkeeper

563
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,840
This meal, you just

564
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,320
Just give a material money

565
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Is it okay

566
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Your uncle is all here

567
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,120
New society, new rules

568
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,880
Come on, come on

569
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,560
Right

570
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
You're welcome. You're welcome

571
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
Team leader

572
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
So many listening records

573
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,720
We have to find out when it will be the end

574
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,480
Be patient and check slowly

575
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,000
Good

576
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,200
Section chief

577
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,560
This is a telegram sent to Radio 0299 last month

578
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,240
Egg

579
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,520
We suspect that eggs are the code words of the Taiwan authorities

580
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
It stands for money

581
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,560
You go to the bank now

582
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
Check whether it is from Hong Kong or overseas

583
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Send money to a man named Shangguan

584
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,680
I've sent Iron Egg

585
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
I'll go later

586
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,480
Go quickly

587
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,000
Good

588
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,720
Section chief

589
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
We've already checked

590
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,600
What we have at present

591
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
All overseas remittances from banks in Beijing

592
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,200
Real name registration materials

593
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,560
There is no Shangguan

594
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,920
Not in Beijing

595
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,920
What about the surrounding area of Beijing

596
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,440
Will there be one in Baoding, Tianjin

597
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,680
According to this, it is possible for Tianjin

598
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,240
Baoding is far away

599
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
And it's not a big city

600
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,920
Chief, I'm going to Tianjin now

601
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
OK, you go ahead

602
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,440
I will inform the comrades of Tianjin Municipal Bureau

603
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,520
Assist you in your investigation

604
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,400
This way

605
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,680
It's getting dark

606
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,920
Let's go early tomorrow morning

607
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,480
I-I'd better rush there overnight

608
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,840
So early tomorrow morning

609
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,880
You can start the investigation

610
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,040
It also saves time

611
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,280
Good

612
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,960
Please come in

613
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,480
Is it Comrade Sun Tie

614
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,440
It's me

615
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,720
My last name is Wan

616
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,840
He is the head of the Public Security Section of Tianjin Municipal Bureau

617
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,840
How do you do, Chief Wan

618
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,200
It's hard to come here overnight, isn't it

619
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Not hard

620
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,880
Let's talk about the situation quickly

621
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,640
Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

622
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,080
Got a call from your senior section chief

623
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,360
We organized people

624
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,480
For all Tianjin and Hong Kong and overseas

625
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
A bank with exchange business

626
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Make a statistic

627
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,280
This is a list of all the banks

628
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,760
That's great

629
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
With this list,

630
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,680
We can start working early tomorrow morning

631
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Comrades in the Public Security Section of our city bureau

632
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Will also cooperate with you

633
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Check these banks one by one

634
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,640
Thank you very much

635
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,000
Chief, you are really a mental calculation

636
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,760
We are really here

637
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,000
In the bank of Heilongjiang Road, Tianjin

638
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Found a huge remittance from Hong Kong

639
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,400
Just like the message on the telegram

640
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
HK $1,500

641
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,800
To whom is it remitted

642
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
It is remitted to Beijing

643
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,960
Changlan Trading Co., Ltd.

644
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,480
The payee is Shangguan Xiaolan

645
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,680
The withdrawal stamp is the seal of this company

646
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
Plus Shangguan Xiaolan's name badge

647
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,480
Hello

648
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,520
I'm Gao Zhiyuan

649
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
OK, thank you

650
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,160
Thank you very much

651
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,080
This news is too important for us

652
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,360
Let's keep you informed if there is any news

653
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Comrades of Tianjin Municipal Bureau

654
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,080
There is new news

655
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,960
There is another remittance from Hong Kong

656
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,840
Remittance of HK $2,500 arrived

657
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,080
It is also remitted to Beijing

658
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Changlan trading co., ltd

659
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
A man named Shangguan Xiaolan

660
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,600
Report

661
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,680
Come in

662
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
Chief, we just intercepted a copy

663
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,360
Telegram sent by Taiwan authorities to Radio 0299

664
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,520
It's all right

665
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,680
Now the situation is very clear

666
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,800
This one named Shangguan Xiaolan

667
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,200
Is the latent spy of the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

668
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,080
She is in charge of Radio 0299 with Zheng Qiang

669
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,200
Have a direct relationship

670
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,920
Just find Shangguan Xiaolan

671
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,640
You can find the clue of Zheng Qiang

672
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,320
I command

673
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,160
Immediately investigate

674
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
Beijing Mayor Blue Trading Co., Ltd

675
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,240
Find Shangguan Xiaolan

676
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
Conduct a full surveillance of her

677
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,560
Yes

678
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,920
By the way, Lao Lin

679
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,520
Investigate the mole

680
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
How's it going there

681
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
I haven't done anything during this time

682
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,960
I have done it completely

683
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
The people involved in this operation in the whole precinct

684
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,960
It's all investigated

685
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,600
No one is suspicious

686
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,840
What about your side

687
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,120
Neighbors and activists involved in this matter

688
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
We've all looked into it

689
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,200
But these people are old residents with roots and bottoms

690
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Old neighbor

691
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,040
No suspicious person was found

692
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,720
Last time I went to the high section chief of the city bureau,

693
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,800
Gao Kechang told Tiedan that they also said it

694
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,200
The people involved in the operation of the whole city bureau

695
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
And nothing suspicious

696
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Then can't this be a headless case

697
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,480
The question is, what about this man

698
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
And it really exists

699
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,640
Then who the hell is he

700
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,520
God knows

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,280
It's been so long since liberation

702
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
Didn't show any clues

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,160
It only means that this spy is hiding too deep

704
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,040
Is a very experienced spy

705
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,480
No matter how cunning the spy is,

706
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,240
There will also be clues

707
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,080
Lao Lin, think again

708
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
From the beginning of liberation to the present

709
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,400
Is there anyone in your precinct

710
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,520
Have you done anything suspicious

711
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,760
Even the slightest abnormal reaction

712
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,800
I really need a good stroke of this

713
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,120
But the problem is

714
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,680
If this spy is from our bureau,

715
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Everyone was by my side on the day of the operation

716
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,640
No one is close to Zheng Qiang

717
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,840
I haven't even entered the hutong

718
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Then how did he give this Zheng Qiang

719
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
What about the tippers

720
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
You said that

721
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,960
The radio station was inactive that day

722
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,800
There are no pigeons either

723
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,320
Or animals passing messages

724
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Then how did this Zheng Qiang know

725
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Captain, she is Shangguan Xiaolan

726
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,079
Advance

727
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,639
How is Xiao Sun

728
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:51,640
That Shangguan Xiaolan really went

729
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,719
Banks in Heilongjiang Road, Tianjin

730
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,880
Took the money

731
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,279
Have you confirmed it

732
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,520
All the comrades in the bank showed me

733
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
Company seal on Shangguan Xiaolan's withdrawal slip

734
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,920
And name badge

735
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,280
It's exactly the same as last time

736
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,880
And I also take photos specially

737
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,520
Confirmed it to the bank staff

738
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,360
They said the last time they came to their bank

739
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,040
Take the fifteen hundred Hong Kong dollars

740
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,280
It is also Shangguan Xiaolan

741
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,040
That's great

742
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
This Shangguan Xiaolan can't run away

743
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,840
So now this Shangguan Xiaolan

744
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,720
Where is it

745
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,040
She took the money and rode back to Beijing

746
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,360
It should be almost to the residence by now

747
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
You followed her all the way

748
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,840
She didn't find out, did she

749
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,800
You can rest assured

750
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,960
She was unaware

751
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,960
That's good

752
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,720
Now that she took the money,

753
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,320
That won't be a few days

754
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,840
Zheng Qiang will contact her to withdraw money

755
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,560
Wu Feng Sun Tie

756
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,240
You are keeping an eye on Shangguan Xiaolan

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,840
Find Zheng Qiang

758
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,760
Yes

759
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
Brother, is Tao Ranting going

760
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,680
Excuse me, sir

761
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,800
I pull the monthly subscription here

762
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Customers, eat with them

763
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Eating in it

764
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,520
That Shangguan Xiaolan

765
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,360
With a white and clean young man

766
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
Eat with the inside

767
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
A young man in vain

768
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,400
That young man

769
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,520
White flour scholar who confessed to Zhai

770
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Close in appearance

771
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,400
I suspect it's the same person

772
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,760
Good

773
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll send someone back to get the camera right away

774
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,480
When he comes out later,

775
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,640
Take a picture of him

776
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,240
Show it to Zhai

777
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
See if it's the same person he said

778
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,560
Sir, Tao Ranting is just in front of him

779
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,640
You'll be there in two steps

780
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,400
Thanks a lot

781
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,720
Big Brother

782
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Be careful when you go out this time

783
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,080
This Shangguan saw his sister get funds

784
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,160
It's about time to come back

785
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,920
He met his sister

786
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,680
You have to eat and drink

787
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,120
What time is it and where is it

788
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,320
It's here again today

789
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,000
It's time to get in touch with Taiwan

790
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,760
That's it

791
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Wait for the boy to come back

792
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,800
Tell him to get him ready

793
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,080
I'm sure I'll make it before the appointed time

794
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,120
Be sure to come back

795
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,840
Brother, can you not go

796
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,640
This little yard can suffocate me

797
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,360
The current situation in Beijing

798
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,840
I don't know anything about it

799
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,360
That's no good

800
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
I can't cut off contact with all the people outside

801
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,400
If that's the case

802
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,280
Don't say the Communists didn't catch me

803
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,920
Even if you suppress it, you will suffocate me

804
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,920
Brother, be careful

805
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Come back early

806
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,800
Don't worry

807
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,560
How is it

808
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,560
Did you eat well

809
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,520
Full sister

810
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,400
Sister, go back

811
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,200
Brother and sister are still the same sentences

812
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,520
Be careful, be careful, be careful

813
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Do you know

814
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,680
Don't worry, sister

815
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,520
I know

816
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,520
Foreign car

817
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,760
Coming

818
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,600
Then I'll go first

819
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,000
You sit tight

820
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,040
Let's go. Let's go

821
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,160
Pay attention

822
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,440
Where are you going, little brother

823
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,760
Beichizi

824
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,280
Get it

825
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Then wait a little longer

826
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,680
Brother, sit tight and go

827
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,000
Sir

828
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,520
All the people I developed were arrested

829
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,920
The government has a great countermeasure

830
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,720
All the doorways have been basically cleared away

831
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,000
Even if all the people we develop are not arrested,

832
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,840
The rest of the people are also hiding in Tibet

833
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,120
There is no contact

834
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,680
We are strictly ordered to carry out effective actions

835
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,200
Strengthen the momentum of the national army on the mainland

836
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,520
No way

837
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,280
Chief Zheng, what time is this

838
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,160
Let's think about how to save our lives

839
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,720
Escape from danger several times

840
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Thanks to Mr. Wang's secret tipping off

841
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,120
Zheng has never had a chance to thank his husband

842
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,960
The government is now aware of it

843
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,080
Start internal cleaning

844
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,880
In the future, it will be difficult for me to help you

845
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,360
Don't charge, sir

846
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,040
You are my only contact with the outside world

847
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,320
You want to cut off contact with me again

848
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,120
Then I'm really a lone wolf

849
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,920
Rest assured

850
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
I won't leave you alone

851
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,920
I'm still the same

852
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,680
This day of every month

853
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Or this place

854
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,560
We exchange information

855
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,920
Row

856
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,720
As long as you can see your husband every month

857
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,600
I will be practical

858
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,840
Little brother has arrived

859
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,040
Hard work

860
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,800
Yes, thank you.

861
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,560
Team leader

862
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,000
You two stay here and watch

863
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,000
Xiao Sun and I will report back to the city bureau first

864
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,880
Report anything to me

865
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,160
Go

866
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,840
We have found out now

867
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,720
It is a young man who keeps up with Guan Xiaolan's joint

868
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,120
This man lives on Beichizi Street

869
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,640
A picture of the young man

870
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
We washed it out, too

871
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Let the surname Zhai confirm it

872
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,840
That young man is with Zheng Qiang

873
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,680
White flour scholar in charge of sending the newspaper

874
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
His name is Shangguan Xiaolong

875
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,520
Since this Shangguan Xiaolong

876
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,640
Is responsible for sending telegrams

877
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,720
That means the radio station

878
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,040
It should also be in the courtyard of Beichizi Street

879
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,800
Right
