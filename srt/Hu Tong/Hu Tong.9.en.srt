1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Elder sister, where did my sister go when she was arrested

2
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,880
It's not going to jail, is it

3
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
Can you still come back

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Coal core

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,040
Didn't your sister go to jail

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
She has gone to school

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,000
Is to get an education

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,080
It won't be long before you come back

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Really

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,360
Really, I won't lie

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't worry

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,240
Shirley, take the coal core to your place and sleep

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
I have something to discuss with Sister Hong Ying

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,560
I'll take them to sleep quickly

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,400
You two have a good chat

16
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,120
Go ahead

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Coal core and sister go back to sleep in the house

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,080
Come inside and sleep with me

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
Tell me what's missing

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
What's the matter with you, Tian Zao

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Reform prostitutes in Beijing

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
The street government issued documents

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,680
You don't know, you

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
I know that file

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
But that word knows me

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
I don't know the word

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,600
I looked at it for a long time and didn't understand it

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
How could I forget about it

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,040
I don't blame you for this

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
I should explain it to you

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Sister, what's written on that document

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
You and the PLA chief said

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,000
It's not catching prostitutes, it's reforming

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
What does all this mean

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
The transformation of jujube prostitutes is new China

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,400
A major move to liberate women

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
What to say

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Just now, the leader of the army and I

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,560
I told you everything

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,640
Save this group of suffering sisters

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,800
Let them get rid of the misery and turn over a new leaf

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,800
It is a good thing done by the party and the country

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Elder sister

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,800
Regardless of whether it is a good thing or not

45
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,840
I know

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
I shouldn't have stopped a military vehicle

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,080
I shouldn't have caused you so much trouble

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,680
Not to bother me

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,760
Is to make trouble for yourself

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,360
You wanted to be a street activist

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
The leader has approved it

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
It will be announced soon

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
But at this juncture

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,440
You have made such a big disaster

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Can you be a street activist

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
It's really two things to say

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,720
Don't price, sister

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,040
This can't be delayed

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,880
Elder sister

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,880
Director

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,440
I have seriously criticized Comrade Tian Zao

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,760
The mistake she made this time is really a bit serious

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,040
But since the PLA entered the city,

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,280
Comrade Tian Zao has done a lot of work

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,440
She is meritorious

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
Do you think you can think about it again

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,640
It hasn't been so long

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,280
Why don't you say something

69
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,240
What else can I say

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,440
You're from the government, too

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
You're a communist, too

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Why don't you go talk to Sister Hong Ying and them

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
You tell them I know it's wrong

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
Give me a break this time

75
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Let me be a street activist

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,160
Is that all right

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
You know it's wrong now

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
What did you do when you stopped the car last night

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Fortunately, Sister Hong Ying and Director Lin gave you a guarantee

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Otherwise

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
I must treat you as a spy and go counter-revolutionary

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
You're arrested

83
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't scare me if it's not you

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,200
What spies and counter-revolutionaries

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
This hat won't fit on my head either

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm telling you

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,920
Jujube

88
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,400
You said you were so old

89
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,320
And do such a stupid thing

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,280
What do you want me to say about you

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
You say I'm not good at anything

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,640
It's best to intercede for me

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,720
This matter

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
I really can't help you

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,040
Iron egg

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
What do you mean

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
You're my fiance

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
We had a deal

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
Wait for this street activist to approve it

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,680
We'll get married

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
You backed out at this time

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,400
You don't want to marry me, do you

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
You don't want to marry me. Say it

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Jujube

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
You, don't be unreasonable

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Can these two be the same thing

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,240
It's the same thing with me

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
Just say whether you will help or not

109
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,160
Jujube

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,920
Sit down first. You sit down

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
It's not that I don't want to help you

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Is that I really can't help

113
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,440
Our Public Security Bureau is in charge of your district government

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
It's two systems

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
There is no direct affiliation

116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Even if I intercede for you

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,640
People don't listen to me either

118
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,000
Besides

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,960
Even if Sister Hong Ying can't speak well,

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,360
Then it doesn't matter who says it

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,840
Then what should I do

122
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
Now all the neighbors know

123
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to be a street activist

124
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm not thinking about it now

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
How ashamed I am

126
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,880
In such a big hurry with you

127
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm afraid you won't be a street activist

128
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Losing noodles, right

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
No

130
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,520
It doesn't matter to me whether you lose it or not

131
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
What is important is that

132
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,000
I am willing to be an activist in this street

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
I want to be with Sister Red Tassel

134
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,240
Do something practical for the residents in the neighborhood

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,360
Besides

136
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
You don't know

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
I can do something for everyone

138
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I feel comfortable in my heart

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
I am happy in my heart

140
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,160
No matter how bitter or tired I am, I am not afraid

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
I will

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
I know you

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,400
May

144
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,360
But now the government is not happy

145
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,640
Then what can we do?

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
You will say these pieces of soup

147
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Looking for you is redundant

148
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
Where are you going

149
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm going to find Sister Hong Ying

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,240
Elder sister

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
I've done so much for the government

152
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
I have no credit and I have hard work

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
I'll make up for it if it doesn't work

154
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,560
Success or failure

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
Brother Lin is right

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
You are a little time bomb

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,840
If I don't deal with you this time

158
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
What kind of disaster will happen in the future

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
That Lin doesn't like me at all

160
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,040
He just took the opportunity to get revenge

161
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
He has no grievances with you

162
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,240
What did he get back at you for

163
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
He just doesn't like me

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,960
I don't like him anyway

165
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,920
What did he do to you

166
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
You don't like him anymore

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
He reused Qin Defu

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
Do you think I can take a fancy to him

169
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
Here you go again

170
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,640
That's enough

171
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
I won't tell you so much.

172
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,600
Jujube

173
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,400
The superior leadership has informed me

174
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
In the list approved by this review,

175
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
Mark your name

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,320
Mark your name

177
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,240
You want to be a street activist.

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,120
It's a complete failure

179
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,840
Elder sister

180
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,119
You can fight for me again

181
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,400
For your sake

182
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
I've been calling this morning

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,159
My mouth is almost worn out

184
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,159
I also got a bad criticism from our leader

185
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
I can't protect you anymore

186
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
It's really out of the question

187
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,040
It's really out of the question

188
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,640
You this

189
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,080
Elder sister

190
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Let you worry about my affairs

191
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm sorry for you

192
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,600
I have to go

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,320
Come back

194
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Sit down

195
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
I haven't finished yet

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,600
Look at your quick temper

197
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,560
Jujube

198
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,800
Next

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,720
I want to tell you something very important

200
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,120
The reason why you are so impulsive and foolhardy

201
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,520
It is because you don't understand the party's policies

202
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,040
Unorganized and undisciplined

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
In the final analysis

204
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
It's because you have no culture

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
If you have the culture

206
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,600
You will study the documents carefully

207
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,240
So the reform of prostitutes

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
You will be clear

209
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,600
It's impossible to do it

210
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,240
Such absurd and outrageous things come

211
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,640
I also want to have culture

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
I have no money to go to school since I was a child

213
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
How did the culture come from

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,960
That's what I want to tell you.

215
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,280
The superior leadership has decided

216
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,960
Open orphan adoption homes in the whole city

217
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,760
Run literacy classes

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
For you

219
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,720
There is also Dayong Xiaofeng coal core

220
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
Children like this find a home

221
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Let you stop wandering the streets

222
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,360
Let you have food and clothing

223
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,440
And organize you to study culture

224
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,800
What you said is true

225
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
When did I ever lie to you

226
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,200
New China under the leadership of the Communist Party

227
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Is to reform prostitutes and eliminate opium

228
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,480
Let all orphans not wander the streets

229
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,400
Let all the people live a good life

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,560
Because we are the Communist Party

231
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,200
That's great

232
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
The Communist Party is really good

233
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,120
New China is really good

234
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,560
Sister, I want to join the Communist Party

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,520
Good

236
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
It is a good thing to want to join the party and work

237
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,120
But the premise is that

238
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,800
You must learn culture well for me

239
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,480
I must study hard

240
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,040
Elder sister

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
It doesn't look like a prison

242
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
Didn't I tell you

243
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,560
These lesbians

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,560
Is organized to transform labor

245
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,000
Who told you he was in jail

246
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,520
I understand everything you say

247
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
It's just that I don't believe it

248
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
You are really good

249
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,720
This row is a lesbian living area

250
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,680
All the bedding

251
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Daily necessities such as toiletries

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,400
All provided by the state

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,720
It was the playground that we passed by just now

254
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,560
They usually do exercises

255
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Exercise is done there

256
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
This is their study area

257
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
Let's talk about it now

258
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,240
The Basic Properties of Cotton

259
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,320
Its characteristic is good heat preservation

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Then the elasticity may be almost

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,800
And where's our hemp

262
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
These lesbians

263
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,800
What are you studying here

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,520
These lesbians

265
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,200
Most of them have no culture

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
We teach them to read and write

267
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,760
In addition to doing some literacy studies,

268
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
The most important thing is to teach them some

269
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,080
Knowledge of job skills

270
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,840
Such as sewing, weaving, hand knitting and other skills

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
For them to join the work and go to the society in the future

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Lay the foundation

273
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
How about Comrade Tian Zao

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,000
Hearing is false, seeing is believing

275
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,440
You saw it this time, didn't you

276
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,800
Sister, I am really happy for these sisters from the bottom of my heart

277
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,480
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China

278
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
How can they be today

279
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Sister Chun Xi

280
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,000
You have the true spirit of Lenin

281
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
This is all issued by the government

282
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
You know, Jujube

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,840
We are now in class every day to practice exercises and learn to weave

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,720
Life can be fulfilled

285
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
So are we

286
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm telling you

287
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,800
My coal core is small and brave

288
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,600
We all got into that literacy class

289
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,080
Reading and reading culture every day

290
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,120
Do you know

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
The government cares what we eat and what we use

292
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,560
Whatever we wear

293
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
We don't have to go out on the streets anymore

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Picking up garbage and begging for food

295
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,520
Sister, I have a name now

296
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,680
His name is Kong Jianguo

297
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,280
Right

298
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,800
Founding a nation

299
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,520
That's a good name

300
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
This is from the literacy class teacher

301
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,120
Jujube

302
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
Look at the coals

303
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,680
Non-statehood

304
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,320
Watching the founding of the People's Republic of China can enter the school to learn culture

305
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm really happy in my heart

306
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,360
Elder sister

307
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,120
We can see you like this now

308
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
I am also happy from the bottom of my heart

309
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,360
Right? Coal core

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,920
Third brother, you should know that you are out of misery now

311
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
I'm sure I'm happy for you, too

312
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,200
What happened to the third brother now

313
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,600
Third brother sells fake medicines

314
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,160
But you can rest assured

315
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,960
He was deceived, not the principal offender

316
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,960
So the government dealt with it lightly

317
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Sentenced to half a year's labor reform

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,480
Third brother is all for me

319
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,840
Elder sister

320
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,280
I really convinced the party

321
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,680
This is all for the good of the people

322
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Let me put it this way

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,400
From now on

324
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
I will do whatever the party asks me to do

325
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Let me go east

326
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
I will never go west

327
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
Let me jump into the well. I'm sure I won't go to the roof

328
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
Talk nonsense again

329
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,200
Who went up? You jumped into the well and went to the house

330
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
I was joking

331
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,680
Elder sister

332
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,400
I got into this literacy class

333
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
I have learned a lot of words

334
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
I can read newspapers now

335
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
Jujube

336
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,080
I really hope you can grow up quickly

337
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,920
Fast, especially fast

338
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,680
Elder sister

339
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,320
The location of street activists

340
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,640
You have to keep it for me

341
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
When I learn it well,

342
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,760
And follow you

343
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,720
That depends on your performance

344
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,680
Isn't it

345
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
According to various intelligence summaries,

346
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
It is basically certain

347
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,680
Three places where Zheng Qiang hid

348
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,360
We will arrest Zheng Qiang tonight

349
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,320
Is the information accurate

350
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,840
A large number of investigations and designations have been conducted

351
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,840
Basically accurate

352
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,800
I know this piece well. I'll take someone

353
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,800
I'll pack this one

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,560
Good

355
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,920
Then I'll take the rest of the place

356
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,640
In order not to disturb the people around us,

357
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,600
The operation time is set at 12 midnight

358
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Yes yes

359
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,680
Eight horses

360
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,160
Man, the money is on the table

361
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
All right, take your time

362
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
Keep up

363
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,920
Quickly

364
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,439
Withdraw

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,479
Yes

366
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,080
Go

367
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,280
Busy all night

368
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,240
I didn't even see a Zheng Qiang man Mao

369
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,720
Comrades

370
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,600
What we're dealing with

371
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
Is rich in latent experience

372
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
An extremely cunning senior Kuomintang spy

373
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,920
We have to do well

374
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,520
Prepare for a long struggle with him

375
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,360
As long as he doesn't leave Beijing

376
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,600
We are sure to catch him

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,160
That's right

378
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,640
No matter how cunning the enemy is,

379
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,360
I can't escape the tight encirclement of the people

380
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
One day

381
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,280
We will put Zheng Qiang

382
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
And all the spies lurking in Beijing

383
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Are uprooted

384
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:28,840
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

385
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
President Truman issued a statement

386
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Strictly condemn the aggression of North Korea

387
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
Decided to assist South Korea

388
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,520
And action by the U.N.

389
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,680
At the same time, the US Seventh Fleet was dispatched to help defend

390
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Enter the Taiwan Strait

391
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,320
We welcome and support this

392
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Based on our obligations to the Republic of Korea

393
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
And the needs of common interests

394
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
At the request of President Li Chengwan

395
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,560
Decided to send the 52nd Army to reinforce

396
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,840
Its thirteenth division has set sail from Matsu

397
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
Return to Taiwan and return the fifty-second military system

398
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
The army should be within two days

399
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,640
Complete all operational preparations

400
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,120
And first concentrated in Songshan Airport in a group

401
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,280
Stand by for departure

402
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,920
That's great

403
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,600
Do you hear that

404
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Do you hear that

405
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
US Seventh Fleet

406
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,080
Has entered the Taiwan Strait

407
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
The international situation is excellent

408
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,560
The United Nations troops have reached the Yalu River

409
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,000
Volunteers of the Communist Party

410
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Dare to confront the powerful United Nations army

411
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
This is the mantis arm as a car

412
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,280
They are eggs touching Stone

413
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,240
Find death

414
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,000
To find death

415
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,200
Brothers

416
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,800
World War III

417
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
It will explode soon

418
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,520
The national army's counter-offensive against the mainland

419
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
It will start soon

420
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,880
Shangfeng has orders

421
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,080
Ordered those of us lurking in Peiping

422
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Iron Warrior

423
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,040
Arm quickly

424
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Launch an action

425
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
In order to cooperate with the party and the state,

426
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,200
Take back our regime

427
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,120
It's time for you to be loyal to the party and the country

428
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,320
Prepare for action

429
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes

430
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,840
To be registered

431
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,320
Don't forget it, sister

432
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,760
To register, to register

433
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,000
You guys line up

434
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,720
Don't squeeze, don't squeeze

435
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Maintain order

436
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,520
Maintain order

437
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,120
Everyone has to line up

438
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,680
Uncle and aunt

439
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,680
You can't get it without waiting in line

440
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
Maintain order

441
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,840
Back row

442
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,040
Queue all

443
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Everyone must maintain order

444
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,960
Back row

445
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,200
Don't cut in line

446
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,640
Come on, come on

447
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
Come on, one by one

448
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,560
Come on, come on

449
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,360
Two pairs of cotton shoes

450
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,800
Slow down

451
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,680
Remy, right

452
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
A dustpan of corn

453
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,400
Come here and give it to me

454
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,560
All these letters will be sent to the post office then

455
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,280
Come on, come on

456
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,960
Cotton shoes

457
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
Thank you. Thank you

Register here

459
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,720

460
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,200
Come and register here. Register here

461
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,560
Letter of condolence, right

462
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,560
All right

463
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,480
Find two people over there

464
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
Come to Aunt to register

465
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,560
Come on, come on, come on

466
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,520
Write it down. Write it down

467
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,880
It's all registered. Don't miss it

468
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,880
Remember to register

469
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Come

470
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,120
A pair of cotton shoes

471
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,640
Come

472
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,520
Small size

473
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,600
Paddy what

474
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,440
Let me have a look

475
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Thousands of patriotic youths have left their homes

476
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,520
Leaving the classroom and leaving the factory workshop

477
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,240
Accepted the instructions and expectations of the motherland

478
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,360
Carry a light bag on your back

479
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Say goodbye to relatives and friends at the station

480
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,840
Go, go bravely

481
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,600
Soldiers who defend their country

482
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,200
The great motherland is urging you

483
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,200
Suffering North Korea is looking forward to you

484
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,480
May you wipe out the enemy

485
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,280
May you write back often

486
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
Bring us the news ahead

487
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,320
A thousand words can't be said

488
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Remember this sentence and wish you a successful return

489
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,840
Goodbye, dear comrades

490
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,240
This is

491
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,400
Did you win this?

492
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
There is no approval letter either

493
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,680
This has nothing to do with Americans

494
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,720
Boss, we don't like to hear this

495
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,760
You are not ambitious for others

496
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,440
Destroy your prestige

497
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,440
Let's not talk about anything else

498
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,720
Dare to follow the big old beauty of the Communist Party

499
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,880
Do it with live ammunition

500
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,800
I am convinced when I ask for modesty

501
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,840
Think about it

502
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,080
Lao Jiang

503
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,080
Eight million troops

504
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,320
Meet Americans

505
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,400
Is there only a nod and a bow left

506
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,040
Still clinging to other people's thighs

507
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,280
What about the Communist Party

508
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,200
The weapons and equipment are far worse than those of Americans, right

509
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,080
There are not even many planes

510
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,040
Dare to be brave and high-spirited

511
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
Crossing the Yalu River, right

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Cattle

513
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,200
Let me tell you something

514
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,920
Give Chinese people a long face

515
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,920
This American shell

516
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,640
It's all on the edge of our Yalu River

517
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,120
Then Chairman Mao won't say it

518
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,440
This War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is to defend the country

519
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,520
That's right

520
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,160
Dead lips and cold teeth

521
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,640
North Korea

522
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,920
Those are our brothers and sisters separated only by a strip of water

523
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
This Communist Party is really great

524
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,560
Suo Ye

525
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280
I spent a few days in this prison

526
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
That's a great improvement in consciousness

527
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
What we're talking about is a reason

528
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,640
Let's not mention anything else

529
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,160
Just mention my ancestors

530
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,920
Thirteen generations of Qing Dynasty

531
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,360
Three hundred years of history

532
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,960
It makes people beat up

533
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,680
Compensation for ceded land

534
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
Humiliate one's power and country

535
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
What about the Communist Party

536
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,160
Now they are all out of the country

537
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,480
Dare to fight the United Nations led by the Americans

538
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Sixteen countries

539
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,600
It is twice as many as the Eight-Power Allied Forces entering Beijing

540
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
What's the matter

541
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,200
It's on

542
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,600
Right

543
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,000
Right

544
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,480
You can win if you fight or not

545
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Let's put it aside first

546
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,360
Just rush this boldness of vision

547
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,520
I ask for three and only two words

548
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,960
Be twice convinced

549
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
Add another one

550
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,480
Throw yourself into the ground

551
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,280
Ye Suo has known you for so many years

552
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,680
That's the most reliable thing to say

553
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,160
But seriously

554
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
This Communist Party is for our common people

555
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Be able to live well

556
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,880
Soldiers on the front line

557
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
Bloodshed and sacrifice

558
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
We can't do it as ordinary people.

559
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
We have to donate money if we have the money

560
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,720
Strong output

561
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Yes

562
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,600
Right

563
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,880
Don't say anything

564
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
This jujube makes me accept the task of military shoes

565
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,680
I haven't finished it yet

566
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,960
I have to hurry to get busy

567
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,040
Get get

568
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,320
Then I will give it to the volunteers now

569
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,240
Sew a condolence bag

570
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll go now

571
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,760
Busy busy

572
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
Our Pear Garden Guild

573
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Is rushing to organize all the teams

574
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,520
Arrange a new program together

575
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
Propaganda to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

576
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,200
I have to go to a meeting

577
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,280
Busy all busy

578
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,640
Good busy

579
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
Get busy

580
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,240
We're all busy here

581
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,560
What are you busy with

582
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,120
I

583
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,920
Right

584
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Sole

585
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,360
I can't come to this

586
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
Let me embroider this condolence bag

587
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
My eyes don't work either

588
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,480
Stab me again

589
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm going to sing opera with the boy boss

590
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,920
Just like us

591
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
People who fight for banners don't want us

592
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
It's not that you said I can't bear this shoulder

593
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,080
You can't carry a basket with your hands

594
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,360
What can I do

595
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
My greatest contribution is not to add chaos

596
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,760
Come on, just a dude

597
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,080
Brother Suo, why are you here

598
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Xi'er, I haven't seen you for several days

599
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,200
I miss you

600
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,640
Now our sisters

601
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
Working overtime every day

602
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,120
Weaving for volunteers

603
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
There is no other time

604
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,080
Understanding understanding

605
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Multiple understanding

606
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,000
Then do it yourself

607
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
Don't be too tired either

608
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,240
Pay attention to the body

609
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,400
Eat something delicious

610
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,920
Don't worry

611
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,560
The food in our canteen is good

612
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,560
Besides

613
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,080
The Communist Party saved us from suffering

614
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
Let's learn culture

615
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,640
And now we're in a textile mill

616
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,400
Be a textile worker in new China

617
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,360
These are our second parents.

618
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,400
I have to serve my country even if I am exhausted

619
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,720
Contribute to the volunteers on the front line

620
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Hang Chun Xi

621
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Now I talk in one set

622
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
Have a level

623
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,480
Learn for nothing

624
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Brother Suo, I won't chat with you

625
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,160
I have to get back

626
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,360
You should hurry back, too

627
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,080
Xi

628
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,600
I called you here to tell you

629
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,280
About our marriage

630
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,160
Let's talk about it later

631
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,680
Busy all busy

632
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm the only one idle

633
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,200
Elder sister

634
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,280
Now the streets are full of recruits

635
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
Students in military cadre schools

636
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,640
I would like to sign up for the Army

637
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,600
I know about it

638
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,800
The district office also let us activists

639
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,600
It's been vigorously publicized

640
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,600
But dayong

641
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,040
Recruit students from military cadre schools this time

642
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
In fact, it is recruiting

643
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,120
Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

644
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
This is to go to the battlefield to kill the enemy

645
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,840
I know that

646
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
But

647
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,480
I just want to defend my country

648
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Go to the battlefield as a soldier

649
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,880
Good brother

650
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
I'm right. You have ambition

651
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,720
My hero should go to the battlefield

652
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,400
Kill the enemy and render meritorious service

653
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,240
I support you

654
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,920
All right

655
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,520
Sister, you've been busy all day

656
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,640
Why don't you go in and have a rest

657
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,600
None of you slept

658
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I can't sleep

659
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,280
Jujube

660
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
Don't rush me

661
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,320
The task you gave me

662
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,520
I can finish it in one more day

663
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,320
Aunt is in no hurry

664
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,640
Sister Hongying said it at the meeting today

665
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,480
Said we should all do our work carefully

666
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
This is all for volunteers

667
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Nathan's shoes

668
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,800
They all have to be strong

669
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,120
You can rest assured

670
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,680
I made shoes

671
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,800
How high a mountain are the soldiers guaranteed to climb

672
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
How far do you go

673
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,120
It won't even rot

674
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,080
OK, I believe you

675
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,800
Take a look

676
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
Can these things become

677
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,480
I said your uncle

678
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,120
This is the guy you eat

679
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,840
It's all donated

680
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,440
I said

681
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,200
An extra portion of iron

682
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,560
Just give it to our volunteers

683
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,920
Can build one more bullet

684
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,120
Don't worry

685
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,520
He keeps the guy who eats

686
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,080
Your uncle

687
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
You are really good

688
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,480
Jujube

689
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,440
That day, you will do the mobilization for our neighbors

690
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
That's very well said

691
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,040
Now we are in this area

692
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,400
The rich donate money and the possessions

693
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,800
That smashed the pot and sold iron

694
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,160
We have to support the soldiers in front of us

695
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,840
Boy is busy

696
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,520
I have to collect it again

697
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
See if there's anything else

698
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,400
My guess here

699
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
You must have come back

700
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,400
Fourth brother, I have been too busy at work recently

701
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Come back very late

702
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Fortunately, you take care of the coal core

703
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,920
The child is tired of practicing

704
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,520
I went to bed long ago

705
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm the only one anyway

706
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,720
I have him with me

707
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,960
I don't feel lonely yet

708
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
By the way, I'll collect it.

709
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
Such a bag of white flour

710
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,800
You donated a piece. Come on

711
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,000
What do you eat when you donate white flour

712
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,640
I still have some noodles with sticks

713
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,040
Enough to eat for a while

714
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,520
Jujube

715
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,320
Our neighbors in this area

716
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,400
Donated flour and rice from house to house

717
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Everybody said

718
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,280
I would rather eat my own steamed corn-bread

719
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,720
Let the frontline soldiers also

720
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,120
Eat hot steamed bread with white flour

721
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,200
Our neighborhood is really awake

722
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,320
Elder sister, that's not your leadership.

723
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,880
Then all our neighbors believe you

724
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,920
Believe in the Communist Party more

725
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,360
Sister Ying, look

726
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
This is our piece

727
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
The flour and rice of the old neighbor's own home

728
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,160
And the removed iron

729
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
Make bullets for all the soldiers on the front line

730
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,080
So that they can eat rice and white flour

731
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,520
This cooking pan

732
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
And kitchen knives were donated

733
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,760
What do ordinary people cook with

734
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,080
Boil some porridge with sticks and noodles in pottery pots

735
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,000
Add some steamed corn-bread at most

736
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't need it

737
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,840
Stir-fry

738
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
You have gone too far, Comrade Tian Zao

739
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,640
Sister, I can't recognize your mistake

740
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,920
How could I have gone too far

741
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Let me ask you something

742
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,680
What is the purpose of the Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

743
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,760
Defeat the Americans

744
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,000
Defend one's country

745
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,960
To defend our country

746
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,280
In order to let the people of New China

747
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Live a good life

748
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,120
You can pour it

749
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,280
Encourage the common people

750
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,920
Donated all the pots for cooking in flour and rice

751
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,760
I also let the people go back

752
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,560
The bitter days of eating chaff and swallowing vegetables

753
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,800
Your present behavior

754
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,760
It seriously violates the propaganda of our party

755
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
Donations and materials must be voluntary

756
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,120
The working principle of doing according to one's ability

757
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,720
Aren't you fooling around? You

758
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,120
I didn't force them to donate

759
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,959
They volunteered that

760
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
Then you didn't play a good role either

761
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,278
The masses

762
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:19,440
It is ok to donate money and materials

763
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,079
But the necessities of life

764
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
That can't be donated

765
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,680
To protect the people

766
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,040
Not only should you have a full stomach

767
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,119
And eat well

768
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
Have a strong body

769
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,120
In order to do more work for New China

770
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,560
Jujube

771
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,000
Look at your watery girl

772
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,479
Now black and thin

773
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,519
My face is green

774
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,679
Haven't eaten well these days, have you

775
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:50,759
Your enthusiasm for work

776
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,919
And the appeal among the masses

777
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,798
This is all worthy of recognition

778
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,200
But I emphasized many times at the meeting

779
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,279
Relevant disciplines

780
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
You are no longer

781
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,839
Illiterate people who can't read big characters

782
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,960
He is also a literate person

783
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,040
I have joined street activists for more than half a year

784
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
I also have work experience

785
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Before doing something

786
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,920
Be sure to use your head

787
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,440
I can no longer rely on my own impulse

788
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,080
Nonsense

789
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,760
I see, sister

790
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,720
How is this jujube stubble

791
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Why did you return it

792
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,280
Four brothers, aunts and uncles

793
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
I made another mistake

794
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,360
Jujube

795
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,720
What's wrong with this

796
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,240
I just want to encourage everyone

797
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,360
Support the frontline soldiers

798
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,600
But I didn't expect it

799
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,280
Neighborhood

800
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
Donate all these articles for daily use

801
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,640
How do you live

802
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
I have made a formalistic mistake

803
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,000
Sister Hongying criticized me

804
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,040
Sister Hongying said

805
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,720
The aim of the Communist Party is to serve the people

806
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,760
I want the people to live a good life

807
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,640
But now

808
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
The people put this guy who eats

809
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,320
All the flour and rice have been donated

810
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
Go back to eat chaff and swallow vegetables

811
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,800
This is something the Communist Party absolutely does not want to see

812
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,960
Sister Hongying said

813
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,720
The Communist Party serves the people

814
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,280
Can make the people of the whole country

815
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
Can live a good life

816
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
Make this country strong

817
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
This is the goal of the Communist Party of China

818
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,640
Jujube

819
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,760
What are you doing here

820
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,480
When Sister Hong Ying came to the city to report today,

821
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,560
Meet me

822
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,760
She told me

823
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,800
You've been working really hard lately

824
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,000
So

825
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,040
I just came to express my condolences to you

826
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,040
Baked sweet potato

827
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,520
It's still hot

828
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,560
Eat quickly

829
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,800
How sweet

830
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,120
You taste it, too

831
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
I ate it all before I came

832
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,720
These are all for you

833
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,400
You eat more

834
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,200
Jujube

835
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,160
I haven't seen you for days

836
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,240
You've lost weight

837
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Lean and more energetic

838
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,600
Sister Hongying told me

839
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
You are active in your work now

840
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,360
Busy all day, day and night

841
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,320
You're a girl's house

842
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,800
Your body is not made of iron

843
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,560
In case you are really tired, something bad will happen

844
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,480
What can I do then

845
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,960
You feel distressed

846
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,480
Of course I feel bad

847
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,360
Jujube

848
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
I see you alone

849
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,760
No one takes care of the cold pot and stove all day

850
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,680
Do you think I can feel no pain in my heart

851
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,880
Or

852
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Why don't we stop dragging our feet

853
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,240
Simply get married

854
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,280
After this,

855
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,760
I can take care of you every day

856
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,200
Isn't that what we said in the first place

857
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
The days have been set

858
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
Who knew the Yanks would make trouble

859
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,560
There are wars on the Korean battlefield now

860
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,480
People all over the country

861
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,440
They are all busy for the soldiers on the front line

862
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,880
You said we were going to work here

863
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,200
Isn't it inappropriate

864
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,680
It seems to be a little less interesting

865
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,960
Tell the truth

866
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
We are under a lot of pressure in the city bureau now

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,440
Those sleeper agents are coming out again

868
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,280
The Kuomintang's underground radio stations emerge one after another

869
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,160
And

870
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,280
Secret agent activities are becoming more and more rampant

871
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,520
We can't wait for twenty-four hours a day now

872
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,800
They are all catching spies

873
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,000
Even I came to see you today

874
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,600
It's all leave in advance

875
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,800
I have to go back to the station later

876
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,120
Then analyze the case

877
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,840
Iron egg

878
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,440
We made a deal

879
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,320
When the battle is over

880
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,560
We'll be married

881
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,200
Is that all right

882
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,320
Cheng

883
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay, I have nothing else to do here

884
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,080
Why don't you hurry back to your work

885
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,560
Then I'm leaving

886
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,080
Go quickly and slow down

887
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,720
Take it

888
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,040
What does that mean

889
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,320
This is my salary this month

890
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,080
In the future

891
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,280
I give you my salary every month

892
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,680
Don't save me

893
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,880
Eat whatever you want

894
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,760
Buy whatever you want

895
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,400
Go away

896
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,840
Wait a minute

897
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,400
You gave me the money

898
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,600
What are you eating

899
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,080
I have more here

900
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,280
Don't save it

901
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,040
I saved it all for you

902
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,480
Third brother gets up early enough

903
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,160
Jujube

904
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm waiting for you right here

905
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
I'll look for you if you don't look for me

906
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,120
Looking for me

907
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,600
What's the order

908
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
The police station gave me a task

909
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,560
You're my focus now

910
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,400
Now is an extraordinary time

911
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,880
You are honest.

912
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,160
Don't talk and move

913
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,520
Stay honestly

914
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,840
Don't do anything to trouble the government

915
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,680
Do you understand

916
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,640
Can't

917
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,480
Jujube

918
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,680
You can't look at me the same way

919
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,240
I was also deceived at the beginning

920
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,000
My original intention is to do something for the government

921
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,080
Ever since the government arrested me

922
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,280
I didn't read less in that labor camp

923
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,680
Policy towards the Party

924
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,960
Your third brother is clear to us

925
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,000
Come on, third brother

926
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,680
I don't have time to be here with you.

927
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,480
Go ahead. What can I do for you

928
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,120
Sister

929
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,200
Look at that

930
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,240
What about all the ordinary people in Beijing now

931
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,360
Are all contributing to this volunteer army

932
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,520
Lian Chunxi works in three shifts

933
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,880
It's like busy three

934
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,440
Just your third brother, I have no reason all day

935
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,520
Idle with five ridges and six animals

936
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,080
I was looking for you

937
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
I want to tell you

938
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,760
Look at your third brother and I

939
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,080
What can I do for the government

940
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
I see my third brother you

941
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,360
What can I do for the government

942
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,360
What can you do

943
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,680
Yeah, I'm not asking you

944
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm still saying the same thing

945
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,720
You stay honestly

946
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,200
You don't give us any trouble

947
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,240
I'm Amitabha

948
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,160
What else are you doing

949
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,080
Be obedient

950
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,240
Despise people

951
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,360
Row

952
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,280
I don't believe it anymore

953
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,600
I ask for modesty or I won't do it

954
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,480
If you want to do something, you have to do something

955
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,920
I'm surprised you're sweating all over

956
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,000
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

957
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,600
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

958
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,560
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

959
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,880
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

960
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,240
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

961
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,360
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

962
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,840
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

963
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,600
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

964
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,880
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

965
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,440
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

966
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,920
Aunt Xiulan

967
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Director Dapeng

968
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,000
What are your latest instructions for coming here today

969
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,080
Aunt, what instructions can I have

970
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,520
I just came to talk to Shirley about something
