1
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,600
You're hurt like this

2
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
You don't recuperate honestly

3
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
Why do you always go out

4
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,680
Today's army into the city is so lively

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Is it appropriate for me not to go

6
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
Boss, wait a minute and don't rub on your body

7
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm fine. Don't knock

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
Leave it here first

9
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
Have you given birth yet

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,960
Coming

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
Come and put it on

12
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,080
But you're here

13
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Just go and find Shirley to change my dressing

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,400
Let's go together after the change

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Then you have to promise me

16
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
Be sure to pay attention to safety for a while

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,039
Don't knock it.

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,720
Do you hear me

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
You can still touch it with you around

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,600
Go, go, go

21
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
Go quickly

22
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Tell Xiulan to go quickly

23
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,000
That's enough

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
Is Tiedan jujube better?

25
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,600
Much better

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,280
Isn't this just looking for Xiulan to change her dressing

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Lanzi Lanzi will come out soon to change your sister's dressing

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,960
Coming

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
I was just about to go

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
Shirley, go ahead. Waiting for you

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,480
Why aren't you following me?

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
OK, then be gentle

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,600
Don't worry

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,680
Almost

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Row

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
This has to be simmered for you

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Almost

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,600
I said

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
The crackling gunfire last night

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
Did you hear that

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Hear it

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,400
No

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
See this day, there are guns and guns outside the city

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
Nothing new

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,160
I heard the gunshot. It's not far from us

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
It's quite close

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,920
It's not right

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
It is reasonable to say that the army will enter the city today

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
What kind of gun was put on last night

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Can't make this in this city

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,600
Kuomintang skirmishers are fighting against each other

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
I got into a fight with myself

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,440
Ask Iron Egg about this

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,840
Iron egg, what do you say

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
Maybe

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,800
Jujube sister

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Your scab healed quite quickly

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I've been wrestling with my dad since I was a kid

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,600
The foundation is good. Don't worry

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
Sister Zao, do you know

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Brother Iron Egg really stayed with you all night yesterday

62
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,920
I can see that he still loves you.

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
Shirley, I'm telling you

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,840
Yesterday, your iron egg brother was amazing

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Then Han Qingkui's gun is pointed at his forehead

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,320
He just doesn't have fear

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
He saw me hurt

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Rushed up and beat the Han

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,240
Don't mention more relief

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,560
Really? That's quite powerful

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,880
Then Han Qingkui is a bully here

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
So you and Brother Iron Egg

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,320
You can still come back with all your needs and tails

74
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
The iron egg brother also beat him up

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,680
I think this is quite new, too

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm still wondering

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,400
You didn't say Han Qingkui

78
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
Why did he just do it

79
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
Why is he afraid of iron eggs

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
Then you can't ask me

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,320
You must not ask Iron Egg

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
I asked him and he didn't tell me

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Forget it, forget it

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's not think about it either

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
Aren't you both okay anyway

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
But this Han Qingkui

87
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
He is not a good stubble

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
You and Brother Iron Egg have to watch out

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Don't worry, I know what I know

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
That will do

91
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go let's go

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,720
You girl, you're not healed from this injury

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,840
Where do you want to run

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,840
The army entered the city

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How do you say I can't join in the fun

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,920
Walk, walk

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
You here you here

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,880
You this

99
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay, you here

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,480
Aunt Li, let her go if she wants

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
It is also rare to see an army entering the city

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,920
I stayed with her

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,320
Sister, right, mom

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm going, too. I'm going, too

105
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,440
Go together

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,360
Dad

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Don't go out to set up a stall today

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Come with us and watch the PLA enter the city

109
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes, it's not out of the stall. You drink the northwest breeze

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm telling you

111
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
There are many people in the street today

112
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,920
Guarantee good business

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,840
Let's walk

114
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Help your uncle get his things quickly

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Why don't you give me your stuff

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on, come on. It's okay. It's okay

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,760
You give it to me. I'm fine

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
I can walk by myself

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
Be careful

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Don't worry. Go

121
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,800
The child

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
Aunt Li, let's not be idle either

123
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,520
Don't be busy

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
Now the dynasty has changed

125
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
We have to get involved in this matter

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
Wait for me

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
You wait a minute, wait a minute

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Coming, coming

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Didn't you all see it just now

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,720
How mighty the Communist People's Liberation Army soldiers are

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,200
See that tank

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
The cavalry

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
And that battle

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
It's not what words should be used to describe it now

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Mighty and magnificent

136
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
To grandeur

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
Right

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,320
The street is full of people

139
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,720
I can't squeeze in at all

140
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
I can see the back of my head

141
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,440
It's not like you

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,640
Squeeze forward desperately under the protection of iron eggs

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
Of course I see it for real

144
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,320
It would be nice if I didn't get crowded out

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
Of course

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
Iron eggs protected me all the way

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
Along the way,

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,720
Third brother is not

149
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,320
Where did you come from

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,520
Suo Ye

151
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
Your old man is not in Tianjin

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
Mix things up

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
What brings you home

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,560
What wind east wind

155
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,320
Your third master, I entered the city with the army

156
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,600
You can play this one too much

157
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,960
What's the matter

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,320
Helped the team play the flag

159
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Why didn't I see you old in the team

160
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
Come on, boy boss

161
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
Don't pinch when you two meet each other

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
Don't you look at his virtue

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Can the PLA make him raise the flag

164
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
Didn't slip

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes, third brother

166
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
What the hell is going on

167
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't mention it

168
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,280
What about your third brother and me

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,560
I used to do a good job in Tianjin Wei

170
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,640
It's popular in the world and spicy

171
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,680
I don't think there is a war in Tianjin

172
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
Good guy in this war

173
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Bullets flying, shells crackling

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,320
This guy blew me up and hid

175
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
I can't stay in Tianjin at first sight

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
I just touched Beiping back

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,920
Catch up with the army to seal the city again

178
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
You said my back strength

179
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,920
Really become Baylor Ye

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm walking around

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,600
I've been a cat out of town for half a month

182
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
I can't go home without touching the temple gate, can I

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,320
Finally caught up with the army and entered the city

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,960
I just slipped back

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,240
Don't say anything

186
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,040
Aunt Li is quick

187
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Give me a stutter

188
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,320
Let me make up for it

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm so hungry that my chest sticks to my back

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm starving to death.

191
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
I have to get it for you

192
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,240
By the way, I didn't know you were coming back

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,120
Your house is full of dirt

194
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Let's do this

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
That orchid jujube

196
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,560
Hurry up and help the third brother tidy up his home

197
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,200
Row

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,680
I've gone

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
My sister is affected, sister

200
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,880
Elder sister

201
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
Why are you two here in such a rush

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,760
Sister, have you heard

203
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
You haven't told me yet. What have I heard

204
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
This morning

205
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
As soon as the army entered the city, it arrested Han Qingkui

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
Are you serious

207
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Comrades, starting today

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,080
We're officially

209
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Took over the city of Peiping

210
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,720
Beiping was liberated

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,160
Good

212
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Good

213
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,560
According to intelligence

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,920
When Chiang Kai-shek retreated,

215
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,720
Organized and planned

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,760
There are a large number of armed bandits lurking more than two million

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Secret agents, backbone members of reactionary party groups

218
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,520
And other counter-revolutionaries

219
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,840
More than 1.2 million

220
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,800
With the successive victories of the People's Liberation War,

221
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,560
When the Kuomintang lost its city and lost its land and retreated,

222
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,120
All parts of North China and even Northeast China

223
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,560
Kuomintang spies from all over the northwest

224
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,440
Retreat to Peiping one after another

225
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
The large number of people gathered

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
The complexity of the spy system is unprecedented

227
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
The complexity of the spy system is unprecedented

228
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,120
The situation in Peiping is very serious at present

229
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,320
The situation in Peiping is very serious at present

230
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,760
You people

231
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
They are all from the frontline combat troops

232
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,480
Elite transferred to the Municipal Military Management Committee to participate in the work

233
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,680
Starting today

234
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,840
You will be assigned

235
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,360
To take over the whole old police system in Beiping

236
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Comrades

237
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,160
It's a heavy burden

238
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,000
Our new regime

239
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,280
Can it be established smoothly

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
It depends on the concerted efforts of everyone

241
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,080
Wage a resolute struggle against all reactionaries

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,040
Do you have confidence

243
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,000
Have

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,880
Good

245
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Good

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,600
Comrades

247
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,280
According to the instructions of superior leaders,

248
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,520
Our main task at present is

249
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Assist the Municipal Military Management Committee

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,280
Carry out the work of checking household registration in the whole city

251
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,160
Resume work and resume school as soon as possible

252
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,040
Let the people of Beiping

253
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
At the fastest speed

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,720
Return to normal order

255
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Stabilize the people's hearts

256
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,120
Kobayashi

257
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
I heard that you guys last night

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
When I entered the city in advance,

259
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
Encounter a point condition

260
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,960
I was just about to report to you

261
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,160
When I went to town last night,

262
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
I met a group of people in the street

263
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,720
A suspicious-looking person

264
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
I was just about to go up for questioning

265
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
They just shoot

266
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,240
Let's fight back at once

267
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
It didn't take long for the exchange of fire

268
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
We'll wrap him in a circle

269
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
Then I found out about these people

270
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,840
It's a man named Han Qingkui

271
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
Headed by his bodyguard leader

272
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,840
Two Treasures

273
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
According to the people who meet us

274
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,840
Comrade of Beiping Underground Party Working Committee introduced

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
This Han Qingkui

276
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,600
It is a famous bully in Beiping

277
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
Be the object of the first crackdown

278
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,040
After mastering this situation, what about

279
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll bring someone immediately

280
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,040
Surrounded Han Qingkui's house

281
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
In his home

282
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
A large number of guns and weapons were seized

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,960
A large number of guns and weapons

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Right

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,640
Then I suddenly tried Han Qingkui on the spot

286
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,960
But this Han Qingkui is very stubborn

287
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Refuse to confess

288
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Did you catch any other accomplices

289
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,160
In addition to his bodyguards and men

290
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,960
And one of his masters

291
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,600
An ordinary bully

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,960
There won't be so many guns and weapons

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,640
This Han Qingkui

294
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,000
It's probably the Kuomintang Secret Service

295
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,400
Appointed sleeper

296
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,760
You are like this

297
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,640
Retrial

298
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,400
Open the gap from his partner

299
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
OK, then I'll go now

300
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,960
Report to me immediately if there is any situation

301
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,040
Yes

302
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,320
Iron egg iron egg

303
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,560
Iron egg

304
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,040
No, why are you here

305
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,280
I thought it was agreed

306
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
After watching the army enter the city, you will go home and raise it

307
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Why did you run out again

308
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm telling you

309
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
Han Qingkui was arrested

310
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
Caught by the Communist Party

311
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I heard about it

312
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
I have an apprentice

313
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,560
Their family lives in

314
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
Han Qingkui's alley

315
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,960
He told me that last night

316
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,800
The PLA surrounded Han Qingkui's home

317
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,280
Not only did he arrest Han Qingkui

318
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,440
And from their homes

319
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Found a large number of guns and weapons

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,240
No

321
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Why did the Communist Party arrest Han Qingkui

322
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
Said it was Erbao last night

323
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
Run into the PLA with people in the street

324
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,640
And fired a gun

325
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,960
And guess what

326
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
Made dumplings by the People's Liberation Army

327
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
You deserve it, you know

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
What is this called retribution

329
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,480
I told you so

330
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,000
Bullies like Han Qingkui

331
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
There will be no good results

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
That's not necessarily true

333
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,160
Iron egg, you said this Communist Party

334
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
It won't be like the Kuomintang before

335
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
In collusion with that Han

336
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,080
Then let him go

337
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
I don't think so

338
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,080
Anyway, the chatterbox said

339
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,480
The Communist Party is the party of the common people

340
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,480
It is for the poor people to make decisions

341
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
I'll take a look this time

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,760
Is this statement true or false

343
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,320
Han Qingkui, what about your situation

344
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,280
We also have a clear grasp

345
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
Don't take any chances

346
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,280
Honestly account for your crimes

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
This officer

348
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,320
You understand so clearly

349
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,080
What else can I tell you

350
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,040
Where did you get those guns in your house

351
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
The world is in chaos

352
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,600
I paid a lot of money for those guns

353
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,440
That's for housekeeping and nursing home

354
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Bought

355
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
Buy so much

356
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
It's a mess

357
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,600
Then let me ask you something

358
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Where and who did you buy it

359
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
I really can't remember

360
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,920
Han Qingkui, be honest

361
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't think we can't find out if you don't tell me

362
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,080
You are a famous local bully

363
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,840
The crimes you committed against the people of Beiping

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
That's hard to read

365
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
If you hang on again,

366
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
There is only a dead end

367
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,320
Beat sex (virtue)

368
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Fall into your hands

369
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,520
Queye, I'm not going to get out alive

370
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,200
Why is there so much nonsense

371
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,360
Give Queye a crisp one

372
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,320
You are happy and I am happy

373
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,680
Row

374
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,880
Have you thought it over

375
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,280
Sir, I said I said it all

376
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Go ahead

377
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480
I said Suo Ye

378
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
It's been a while since you came

379
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,720
Where did you get rich

380
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,480
Dafa didn't

381
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,480
Little hair, little hair

382
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,760
I see your outfit

383
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
It doesn't look like earning a child

384
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,880
What do you know

385
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,720
Kept

386
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
Ye, this is Jiangnan weaving splendid

387
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,520
Imperial system of construction office

388
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,720
Handed down from one's ancestors

389
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,880
Ordinary people have no land to buy when they have money

390
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't look at it. It's patched

391
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
That's what you're reluctant to take off

392
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,440
This thing is stained with imperial spirit

393
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,280
Do you understand

394
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,520
You have to be a grandfather. What you say is what

395
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
See what you mean

396
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,240
It's a good time today

397
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,240
I came to see your old frame Chun Xi, didn't I

398
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,040
I really let you talk about it

399
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,880
Are you happy

400
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,360
Where is she going if she's not here

401
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Come on

402
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't say anything else quick

403
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,560
Enjoy the tea money

404
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,440
This is Xiaofa again

405
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,480
Wearing imperial clothes again

406
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,920
You don't even have such a few big sons, do you

407
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,440
Keep it

408
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,760
Come on

409
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,160
Don't you tell me

410
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,680
This is your ancestral home again

411
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
No eyes

412
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
Kept

413
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Eight-treasure mosaic

414
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,120
Snuff bottle without sand Jiaqing's

415
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,280
Let me tell you this

416
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
This snuff bottle was put aside during the Taiping period

417
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,320
It's enough to redeem Chunxi

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,280
Do you understand

419
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,040
Is it true or not

420
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,520
Really, really still lick your teeth

421
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Put it away

422
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,240
Give it back some day

423
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,800
Brother Suo

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,960
How come you haven't come to see me for so long

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Is there a lover outside

426
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,280
Forget me

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,080
Can't

428
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,600
I've been happy for so many years

429
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,320
You don't know my thoughts yet

430
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,680
I forget who I can't forget you

431
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,240
I swear to God

432
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
I ask for modesty in my life

433
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
You are the only woman in my heart

434
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,920
Really

435
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,880
Pick up the nice ones to say

436
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,840
Conscience of heaven and earth

437
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,640
I'm telling the truth

438
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,160
Ben wanted me to go to Tianjin to pick up some leaks

439
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,400
Do a little business in this antique

440
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,360
Earn money to redeem you

441
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,280
But these antique players in Tianjin

442
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
More thief

443
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
You can't pick up the leak at all

444
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
Later, I took this heart sideways

445
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,440
Ready to be a gangster and cheat people's money

446
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,320
Guess what

447
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,600
Just these punks in Tianjin

448
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,920
Play self-harm at every turn

449
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,800
Can you stand this thing? This

450
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
Big brick directly slaps the forehead

451
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
Or chop your hands and feet

452
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,240
What the hell? This

453
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,720
How can I do this

454
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
There is no way out

455
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,240
Later, I joined several comprador who worked for foreigners

456
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520
It's a mix of food and drink again

457
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,320
You eat and drink all day

458
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,240
How can you remember my life or death?

459
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,520
You see, here we go again

460
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,720
Xi'er, if I hadn't redeemed you,

461
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,040
Just like us

462
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
What are you going to do in Tianjin

463
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,640
Right

464
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,920
Come on, come on, Brother Suo

465
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,760
I know you are good to me

466
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,840
I have received this love in spring

467
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:22,880
I have received this love in spring

468
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
That's about the same

469
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,160
Let me have a good look at you

470
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,360
Let me have a good look at you

471
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,840
I haven't seen you for a while

472
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,360
My happiness has lost weight

473
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
Nobody hurts like me

474
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
It's better to die early

475
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,800
Don't charge

476
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,600
Your modest brother loves you

477
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,640
I really don't want to live any longer

478
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,560
If I hadn't a brother, coal core

479
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
I would have been

480
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,520
There is no way to endure it

481
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,160
When will the child of coal core grow up

482
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,160
I'll be able to see my parents

483
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,960
Xi

484
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm telling you

485
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,480
You put your heart in your stomach

486
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
And what about us

487
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,240
Let me tell you something

488
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,680
I'll come back this time

489
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,320
As soon as you enter the hospital

490
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,720
I see coals

491
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,440
Grow up

492
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,480
Chubby

493
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,520
Tian Zao takes him as his own brother

494
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,720
And Aunt Li, your uncle in this courtyard

495
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
And the boy boss

496
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,200
They all treat him like a son

497
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
It's fine

498
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
Luckily, I have dates

499
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
With such good neighbors

500
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,000
Otherwise, me and the orphans of coal core

501
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,640
How can I live

502
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,360
You can rest assured

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,600
Aren't we still here

504
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,920
The old political commissar has been found out

505
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
According to Han Qingkui's master,

506
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,320
This Han Qingkui is the Secrecy Bureau

507
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,680
Appoint spies lurking in Peiping

508
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,240
What about these weapons

509
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
It was provided by a spy chief named Zheng

510
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,880
Zheng's surname

511
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,280
What exactly is his name

512
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,760
Master doesn't know his name either

513
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,640
Master said that this Zheng

514
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,000
Is a big spy chief

515
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,040
Han Qingkui was developed by him

516
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
According to the master's account, ah

517
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,520
Han Qingkui has accepted the order of Zheng

518
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,920
To use these weapons

519
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,800
Carry out a major sabotage

520
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,360
Don't ask

521
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
The specific content of this action

522
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
This master won't know

523
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,400
Say, Master

524
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,800
Every time this Zheng

525
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
They all have secret talks with this Han Qingkui

526
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Master is not beside this Han Qingkui either

527
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,080
According to my observation,

528
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,920
This master doesn't seem to be lying

529
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
What about Han Qingkui? Does he have any explanation

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,920
This Han Qingkui stinks and is hard

531
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Don't confess to death

532
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,080
I reckon he may have known his crime

533
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Be sure to die

534
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,560
So the jar broke and fell

535
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,520
Bandits and bullies like this

536
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,760
A reactionary spy who fought to the end

537
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,800
We must deal with it severely and quickly

538
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,160
Lin Zheng

539
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Since from him

540
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,160
Can't dig out any valuable clues

541
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,720
You contact the street government immediately

542
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,680
Hold a public trial meeting as soon as possible

543
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,000
Execute this heinous bully spy

544
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,560
In order to achieve the role of knocking the mountain, shaking the tiger and stabilizing the people

545
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
Raise one's weight for the new regime

546
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,800
Support the people

547
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,480
I understand. Then I'll do it now

548
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Wait

549
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,960
What's the matter, old commissar

550
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,680
What else is required

551
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,640
Sit and sit

552
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
You have taken over the police station

553
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,240
You are a new official

554
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
Follow the instructions of your superiors

555
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,600
External bulletin immediately

556
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,040
Ordered enemy agents lurking in Peiping

557
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,160
And stragglers immediately surrender their guns and register their identities

558
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,040
For those who voluntarily surrender,

559
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,400
Give leniency

560
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
Old political commissar

561
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,560
Such a great deal of organizational work

562
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm afraid we are short-handed when we first entered the city

563
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,160
The police station you took over is a big police station

564
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Under the current shortage of manpower,

565
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,240
You have to screen the use of

566
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
Members of the old police organization

567
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,560
Arouse their enthusiasm

568
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,080
Organize them to work for the new regime and government

569
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,640
But these old cops, they can

570
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,680
I know

571
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,200
Current personnel composition

572
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Is by no means the best choice

573
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,400
But the job in front of us can't wait

574
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,600
You have to believe

575
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,040
Most policemen are also poor

576
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,200
We can only identify adjustments in our work

577
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
Gradually improve one's own team

578
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,200
Bao Jia system

579
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,720
It is a grass-roots organization under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang

580
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
It is a reactionary tool to oppress the people

581
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,760
Must be abolished

582
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,360
Baojia personnel

583
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
It was appointed by the Kuomintang

584
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,880
A tool for ruling the people and oppressing the people

585
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,160
He committed a crime against the people and took a debt

586
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,520
Must be examined by the people

587
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,520
Everyone here need not panic

588
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Our Communist Party's policy is

589
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,520
The first evil must be done

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,480
Associates don't ask

591
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,520
Award for meritorious service

592
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Now Peiping is liberated

593
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,440
All Baojia personnel

594
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,560
Must abide by the Beiping Military Control Committee

595
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,120
Eight Chapters of the Covenant promulgated

596
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,880
Assist the Military Management Committee to check the stragglers

597
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
Turn in guns and weapons

598
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,840
Report spies, bandits and counter-revolutionaries

599
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,200
Take good care of public houses and all public property

600
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
Maintain good social order

601
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,320
Test you through these job reviews

602
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
I hope all of you here

603
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,880
Cherish this opportunity before us

604
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
Our party's policy is

605
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,240
Turn over a new leaf and let bygones be bygones

606
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Chief, after listening to you say this

607
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,800
This Stone in my heart

608
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,120
It's fallen to the ground

609
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
The Communist Party's policy of differential treatment is good

610
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah

611
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,600
Right, right, right, right

612
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
What a surprise

613
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,040
Can we be so lenient

614
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,240
We must do the assigned work well

615
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Fight for meritorious service and atonement

616
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,280
Right, right, right

617
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,200
Atonement for meritorious service

618
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
Since you support these policies of our party,

619
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,280
Then you have to take your own

620
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,200
Within the jurisdiction lot

621
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,000
Party, government, military and police of the Kuomintang

622
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,240
And the spy list to the government

623
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,640
Take the initiative to report stragglers

624
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,560
Mobilize Kuomintang officers from house to house

625
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,600
Party sticks and spies go to register

626
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Surrender to the new government

627
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
Good

628
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
We support the Communist Party

629
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,120
Support the Communist Party

630
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,720
We support the Communist Party

631
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Support the Communist Party

632
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
We support the Communist Party

633
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,680
Support the Communist Party

634
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,400
We support the Communist Party

635
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,320
Director

636
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,760
Who are the people who came to the meeting today

637
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,680
What's the matter

638
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,440
Look at no one pleasing to the eye

639
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
You little girl

640
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,800
All the people who come to the meeting today are in our jurisdiction

641
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,440
Baojia personnel within the jurisdiction

642
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
If we want to start our work as soon as possible,

643
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,680
They are really indispensable at present

644
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,680
Chief, if we point at these people,

645
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,520
The job given to us by our superiors

646
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,880
The designation is not good

647
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
Don't be so arbitrary either

648
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,280
The Party's policy is

649
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,360
Unite all forces that can be United

650
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,920
To serve the people

651
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,440
These Kuomintang periods

652
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,920
The remaining Baojia personnel

653
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,360
Although the composition is complex,

654
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,080
But you saw the meeting today

655
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,760
Most people are still very positive

656
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,160
I hope they will cooperate with us in our work

657
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,320
That's enough

658
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,560
You tidy up the contents of today's meeting

659
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,520
Record retention

660
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,360
OK, I'll go right away

661
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,880
Come in

662
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Is there something left behind again

663
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,320
Lin Zheng

664
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
Why are you here

665
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,680
Why am I here

666
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,040
Since Shijiazhuang,

667
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,560
How long has it been since we've seen each other

668
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,640
I missed you. Come and see if you can't.

669
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,120
Row

670
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,040
Sit down quickly

671
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680
It stands to reason that we work in the same city

672
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,240
I should have gone to see you earlier

673
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,840
I'm extremely busy

674
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,640
I really can't find time to see you

675
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,560
Red tassel

676
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,640
We now manage a region together

677
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
The chance to meet after that

678
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
But there are a lot of them

679
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,560
How is the work going well

680
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,280
Scalding

681
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,600
There are so many things that they are completely blind

682
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,160
I don't even know where to start now

683
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,560
Lin Zheng be patient

684
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,880
But I'm in a hurry

685
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
It's not like fighting

686
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,880
The enemy is on the bright side

687
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
I can have a hard fight with him

688
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,760
But it's too hard now. Now

689
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,200
Everything is difficult at the start

690
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,720
But as long as this head is opened,

691
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,360
I believe we can be in this city

692
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,840
Take root

693
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,240
That's what I'm here to start today

694
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,120
Why are your hands so cold

695
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,480
Then tell me about it quickly

696
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,680
Jujube

697
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,520
There are few people going out in the streets these days

698
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,280
What do I eat with coal core if I don't go out

699
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,680
Look at what you said

700
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,320
I still have less food for your sisters

701
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,200
Except for us

702
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,200
I still have a lot of brothers and sisters

703
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,720
Mom, you really don't have to say

704
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,440
If those children don't have jujube sister in charge,

705
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,800
Isn't that really wild

706
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Right? Coal core

707
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,000
Then we have a stutter

708
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,400
It's not enough to give it to the mouth

709
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,320
Jujube

710
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
Chunxi wants to be a coal core

711
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,680
When you get free one day,

712
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,840
You take small coals with you

713
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,280
Take a look at his sister's place

714
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,440
Third brother, you went to find Sister Chunxi

715
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,080
I said Suo Ye

716
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,520
You will report to Chunhua Building as soon as you come back.

717
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,960
Your feelings for Chunxi

718
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,520
I really admire it next

719
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,480
You see

720
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,960
Brother Suo, how is my sister

721
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,280
It's quite good

722
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,640
Anyway, there is food and drink, and I can't get hungry

723
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,840
I told your sister about the coal core

724
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
The small coal core has grown taller now

725
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,160
Gain weight

726
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,280
There are many people taking care of him

727
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,920
Your sister cried when she heard this

728
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,360
I miss my sister

729
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
OK, wait for two days

730
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,800
I'll try to take you to her

731
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,360
All right

732
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,520
Qi Huo

733
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,800
Coal core

734
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,600
Why are you here

735
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,480
Why don't you teach your disciples here at the wrestling ground

736
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,720
You know what

737
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,079
The government posted a notice on the street

738
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
Han Qingkui will be tried in public tomorrow

739
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,840
Really

740
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,880
Of course

741
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:05,280
There can be fakes in black and white on that big notice

742
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,600
That's great

743
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,720
After investigation

744
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:31,120
Han Qingkui is the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

745
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,519
Appoint spies lurking in Peiping

746
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,280
Long-term bullying

747
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,840
Adultery and plunder are all evil

748
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,400
Killing more than 20 innocent people such as Tian Qingchun

749
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,040
Is a bandit and bully through and through

750
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,640
Counter-revolutionary spy Han Qingkui

751
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,400
Die until you die and fight back

752
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,760
Now it has been ruled by Beiping Military Control Commission

753
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,280
Sentenced Han Qingkui, a counter-revolutionary spy

754
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,760
The death penalty is executed immediately

755
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,680
Put Han Qingkui, who committed the most heinous crimes, down

756
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,480
Folks, step aside

757
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,880
Han Qingkui, you deserve it

758
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,840
Long live the Communist Party

759
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
Long live Chairman Mao

760
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
Long live the Communist Party

761
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,240
Long live Chairman Mao

762
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,440
Long live Chairman Mao

763
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Long live Chairman Mao

764
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Long live Chairman Mao

765
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,240
Long live Chairman Mao

766
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,680
Long live Chairman Mao

767
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,920
Stand still, stand still

768
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
I will register at home soon

769
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,400
You have prepared all the preliminary work

770
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,600
Good good

771
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,120
Children

772
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,640
You guys

773
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Thank the government

774
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,440
Thanks to the Communist Party

775
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
You avenged my father's murder

776
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
You are my reborn parents

777
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,440
Little sister, what are you doing

778
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,640
Government

779
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,360
You are Master Qingtian

780
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,080
I knocked this head for my father and mother

781
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,000
Kowtow

782
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,800
Little sister

783
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
Little sister, listen to me

784
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,760
No matter what you have,

785
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,760
Our Communist Party is not interested in this

786
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,120
Get up first

787
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,200
Come

788
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,560
If you have anything to say, go in and talk about it

789
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:06,880
Go

790
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,920
Go

791
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,880
My dad was on the overpass

792
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,440
I just don't want to pay Han Qingkui protection money

793
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,280
The joint government surnamed Han

794
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,160
My father was killed by the black hand

795
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,320
Then my mother got angry

796
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,880
And died of illness

797
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,280
I became an orphan

798
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
Later, because of my parents

799
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,520
Complain everywhere

800
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,760
But at that time, the government and the police

801
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,920
It's the same nose and eye as that Han

802
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
Don't help us ordinary people make decisions at all

803
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,840
And arrested me

804
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,320
He beat me up before he let me go

805
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,280
The first day of liberation

806
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,480
I heard that

807
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,080
You arrested the Han

808
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
I thought it wouldn't be long before

809
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,960
You will be like before

810
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
Like the Kuomintang officials

811
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,320
He let it go

812
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,040
Children, little sister

813
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,120
I am also a poor man

814
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,200
Our Communist Party is the party of the poor

815
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
It is the party of ordinary people

816
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,320
What we do is

817
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,880
Let the poor people turn over and be liberated

818
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
Let the poor people turn over and be liberated

819
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,400
Become the master of this new China

820
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes, that's what the chatterbox said.

821
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,800
But I didn't believe it

822
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,240
To this day

823
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,240
I saw you shoot that Han

824
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,760
I believe it

825
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,120
Elder sister

826
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
From now on

827
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,560
I will do whatever the Communist Party asks me to do

828
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,480
As long as I need the land of my jujube field,

829
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
You can do whatever you want

830
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,200
My name is Li Hongying, little sister

831
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,800
Is the head of our street government

832
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,520
Do you have anything to do in the future

833
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
You can come to me

834
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Li Hongying

835
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
This name is really nice

836
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,200
This way

837
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,080
From now on

838
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,920
You're my sister

839
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,360
Call elder sister

840
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,120
Elder sister

841
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,440
The next step is to send this police officer into the household in batches

842
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,920
Carry out this check of accounts

843
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,160
Carry out this check of accounts

844
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,520

Old Qin

847
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,280
Although many spies have surrendered now,

848
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
But in Beiping City,

849
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
There are still many hidden spies on the move

850
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,480
In this work of checking the account,

851
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,080
Be sure to focus on investigation

852

Retained personnel of the old police system

860
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,520
We must sincerely support the government

861
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
Don't have any worries

862
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,280
As long as you work hard,

863
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,280
Get rid of the old ones

864
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
Those bad habits of the old society

865
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,960
Our party will accept you sincerely

866
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,360
You give all those

867

The retained police brothers should make it clear

868
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,120
To travel lightly and turn over a new leaf

869
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,600
For New China

870
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,680
Do your part for the people

871
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,520

Everybody thinks

874

The Communist Party can let bygones be bygones

875
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,680
Continue to reuse people like us

876
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
We really mean it

877

Thanks to the government, thanks to the party

878

Director Lin, you can rest assured

879
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,000
For New China

880
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,960
I Qin Defu

881
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,240
I will do my best to die

882
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,120
Comrade Lao Qin can't just talk beautifully

883
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,080
There must be practical actions

884
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
Just look at it

00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,880

More spies, more robbers

923

There are many stragglers and thieves

924
