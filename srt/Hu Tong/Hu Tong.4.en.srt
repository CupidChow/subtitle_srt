1
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,440
Jujube, I know

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,240
You want to be a street activist

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,880
But you are too young now

4
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,760
In another two years

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
I'll definitely put you in division

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm eighteen. I'm not young

7
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,800
Jujube, can you read

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
My parents died early

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm just a wild child digging around

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
How can I have time to read

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,240
I can write the word jujube, the jujube of Tianzao

12
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,440
I'll write you one

13
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,320
Twist

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Look at it

15
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,600
Jujube

16
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,280
Will my sister teach you how to write in the future

17
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,800
That's nice

18
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,720
I'll keep this word as a souvenir

19
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
You can keep it if you want to

20
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
By the way, I have something to do

21
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,320
I want to ask you about it

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Sister, you said

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,880
The shop on the other side of Yandai Inclined Street

24
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,880
Are you familiar with them

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm familiar. What's unfamiliar about this

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm telling you

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
To tell you the truth

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,040
That's our main begging place

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
Which shop haven't reached out with

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
If they don't give it to us, they will be noisy

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
They are terrible. I made trouble

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,080
I'm telling you

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
The bosses saw me

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,080
Like meeting one's ancestors

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,880
So many shops have so many owners

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,560
Do you recognize them all

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,800
Can you not recognize that

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,440
It's from the west end of the street to the east end of the street

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
Ten shops in the south

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Thirteen shops in the north

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
They're all ripe

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
Of all the bosses,

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Which one do you think is less authentic in character

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Let me tell you this

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,920
All the businessmen here are profiteers

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,440
What tunnels are not tunnels

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
That can't be said

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,720
Really, I asked them for two dollars

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,880
It's like cutting their meat

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Grind and chatter

51
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
Come on, I got it

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Sister, are there bad people in that street

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,520
Don't ask

55
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
You keep an eye on it here

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,080
See when she comes out

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay, captain. Don't worry

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Look at this

59
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,200
Director

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Zhou Ping appeared in the oblique street of tobacco bags

61
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Which house did you enter

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
That's the ready-to-wear shop

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
That's great

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Come just in time

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Old Qin investigated it

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,520
You see

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,480
It turns out that Zhou Ping is really from Jingxian County, Hengshui

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,440
This Zhou Ping

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
His real name is Zhou Guifen

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
It comes from a big landlord family

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
During the Anti-Japanese War

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,880
Her father and brother were traitors to the Japanese

73
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Later, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War,

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Was shot and suppressed by our guerrillas

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,040
Later, this alias was Zhou Guifen of Zhou Ping

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,240
He disappeared

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,240
I haven't heard from you since then. I don't know where to go

78
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
We showed the photos to the local villagers

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,480
She is Zhou Guifen

80
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,880
You can be sure now

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,720
This Zhou Ping is a latent Kuomintang spy

82
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,160
This ready-to-wear shop

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Is the contact point between her and her online

84
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Then don't say anything. Arrest people

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't worry

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
Let's have a good analysis first

87
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Now this Zhou Ping is still in the ready-to-wear shop

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,560
If Zhou Ping comes out of the ready-to-wear shop,

89
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
That means this ready-to-wear shop

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
Is the contact point between her and her online

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,960
The owner of this ready-to-wear shop

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,400
Is her online

93
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,040
Then we can arrest people immediately

94
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
Surprise interrogation

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
But if this Zhou Ping is like last time

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Didn't come out of the ready-to-wear shop

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,880
Just like we analyzed

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,800
This ready-to-wear shop is a secret transit point

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
She's out of our sight through here

100
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
Then get in touch with her superiors

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Then we have to

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
Continue to follow Zhou Ping secretly

103
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,120
Only in this way can we pass Zhou Ping

104
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
Find her online

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,000
We checked the ready-to-wear shop

106
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,920
There is no back door

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,960
If it's a transit point,

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,280
There must be a secret passage down there

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
The exit of this passage

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,480
We don't know where

111
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
If we want to continue to follow Zhou Ping,

112
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,280
The whole area has to be defended

113
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,200
We can find out

114
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,120
Where did she come from

115
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
And then where did you go

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
How many people will it take to defend it

117
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,760
With our current manpower, we simply don't have enough people.

118
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,120
I can transfer it to the city bureau when there are not enough people

119
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,080
Anyway

120
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,960
We have to follow the trail and catch it all

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Director Zhou Ping has gone home

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
Chief, you really guessed it right

123
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,480
Our brother who is squatting in the oblique street of tobacco bags

124
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Didn't come back to report

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,360
It means that

126
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,600
Zhou Ping didn't come from a ready-to-wear shop

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,840
Come on, don't say anything

128
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll ask the city bureau for instructions right away

129
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,560
Full control will be deployed from tomorrow

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Yes yes

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
It's urgent for me to find Sister Hong Ying

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
Director Li went out early in the morning

133
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,560
Where did you go

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,160
It is not clear exactly where to go

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,720
Wait

136
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,040
Why hasn't Zhou Ping come out yet

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,160
She was supposed to go to the hospital this morning

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
It should have come out a long time ago

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,320
Something is wrong

140
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,520
Dapeng found a neighbor to visit Zhou Ping's house

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
The director found a folk

142
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,040
Dead man, dead man, dead man

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,280
Dead man

144
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,040
Kill one's mouth

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Walk to the ready-to-wear shop

146
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,040
Go

147
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,120
The director has a secret passage

148
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,120
Old commissar, this is my problem

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I will definitely make a profound review

150
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,000
But you can rest assured

151
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
The hospital assassination case

152
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,200
I'll find a way to break it

153
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
If I can't break it

154
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
You don't have to remove me

155
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Where's my Lin Zheng

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
I have no face to go on doing it.

157
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,720
Director

158
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,920
We raided the garment shop owner

159
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
According to him

160
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,200
This secret passage

161
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,920
It was there when he took over this place

162
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
As for his latent mission

163
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
Is to keep this secret passage

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,800
Help him go online

165
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
And his online is Zhou Ping

166
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
As for who Zhou Ping went to see

167
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,160
He is ignorant

168
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,080
As far as the present situation is concerned

169
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
He is a wannabe

170
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
I can't ask anything else

171
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
This Zhou Ping is dead

172
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,040
All the clues are broken

173
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
The superior leaders are still chasing so closely

174
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
You just made a written pledge to fulfill a military order again

175
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,160
But the problem is that Zhou Ping went out through this secret passage

176
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
Who did you meet

177
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,480
We have no idea

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,360
Where are we going to catch her on the line

179
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
Come on, stop it

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Why don't you go back first

181
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Let me think about it

182
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Copy that document for me later

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,320
Elder sister

184
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,400
Sister, you can come back

185
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,800
Jujube, why are you here

186
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,160
I have important information to tell you

187
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,600
The house said, "Go for a walk."

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,440
Lao Lin

189
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,080
What can I do for Red Tassel

190
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
Let me introduce you

191
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
This is the field jujube of my segment

192
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Xiaozao, this is Director Lin of the branch office

193
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
Hello, Director Lin

194
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
You are Tian Zao

195
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,880
I heard Red Tassel talk about you

196
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
You discovered Zhou Ping's true identity

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,520
Right

198
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
You know this and this

199
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,080
Come on, get down to business

200
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,080
We have important information to report to you

201
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,640
What information

202
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
You killed Zhou Ping

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,920
She's been exposed

204
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,000
How do you know

205
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm in the yard

206
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,960
Meet Qin Defu

207
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,800
He told me when I was talking to him

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
He is going to Jingxian County, Hebei Province for an external transfer

209
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,800
When I heard it was Jingxian County, Hebei Province

210
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
Isn't this Zhou Ping's hometown

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,200
That proves it

212
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,480
The Communist Party has its eye on her

213
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
Zhou Ping and his family are big local landlords

214
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,720
Who doesn't know her

215
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Qin Defu went here

216
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm sure I'll ask the bottom

217
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,360
Zhou Ping, I can't keep it

218
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,160
Luckily, I started early

219
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
Let me tell you clearly

220
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Now the police found Zhou Ping dead

221
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
The owner of the ready-to-wear shop was also arrested

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
What a pity

223
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,440
You are the main person in charge of the hospital assassination

224
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,440
Do you have to move your place

225
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,080
It is better to be quiet than to move

226
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,760
I have a single line contact with Zhou Ping

227
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,360
This clue will be broken

228
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
As for the garment shop owner

229
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Let them judge it

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,080
I'd like to see it

231
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
What ability does the Communist Party have to find me out

232
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,920
It's you

233
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,320
It won't be exposed, will it

234
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,600
It is impossible

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
How do they know about me

236
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,360
Come and come

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,280
My goodness

238
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,640
Jujube

239
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,600
How did you find this clue

240
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,440
Sister Hongying came to our courtyard

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,320
When investigating the origin of Zhou Ping,

242
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
I just feel something is wrong

243
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,120
I have a heart

244
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,600
Later, many businessmen came to set up stalls in the alley

245
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
And this little comrade

246
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
OK, Tian Zao

247
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
You are vigilant enough.

248
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
Comrade

249
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,680
I have lived in the alley for eighteen years

250
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
As long as outsiders come,

251
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
I can see it at a glance

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Besides

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,880
As soon as you enter the alley, keep an eye on this Zhou Ping

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,200
And followed her

255
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,760
I don't want to ask once I think about it

256
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
Zhou Ping must be suspected of being a spy

257
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,840
Director

258
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,880
If this Zhou Ping had Comrade Tian Zao's vigilance,

259
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Then we would have been discovered

260
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
Don't interrupt

261
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,440
Jujube went on to say

262
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Then I went to Sister Red Tassel's office

263
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,160
She talked to me about the oblique street of tobacco bags

264
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,800
Information about the shop owners nearby

265
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
I just think this thing

266
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,040
It must have something to do with Zhou Ping

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
I contacted all my brothers and sisters

268
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,400
And a few alley mouths near the cigarette bag inclined street

269
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Car repairman, three-wheeled repairman, popcorn seller

270
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
Grinding scissors and knives

271
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,920
Stall-setting, street-walking

272
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
Those uncles and aunts

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,520
Keep an eye on this Zhou Ping for me

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,880
Don't say it was just after noon that day

275
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
After this Zhou Ping came out of home,

276
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
Directly into the tobacco bag oblique street

277
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
And then somehow

278
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
From the west exit of Yaer Hutong

279
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
A little ruined temple came out

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,760
Uncle Liu, who just happened to be a sugar seller by the sea

281
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,560
Be seen

282
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,200
Then she went straight back along the sea

283
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,760
When I walked to the silver ingot bridge,

284
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,840
Dayong and Xiaosi are lying there

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,160
I also saw her cross the bridge

286
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Jujube, wait a minute

287
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,440
Come on, come on

288
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Come

289
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,440
Come

290
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Tell me something about it

291
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,880
Where did she go from

292
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
I can't understand this

293
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
I'd better tell you directly

294
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,600
You said you said

295
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,280
After she crossed the silver ingot bridge,

296
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
I entered Dajinsitao Hutong

297
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,600
Along the big gold wire sleeve and the small gold wire sleeve

298
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,840
Went to Nanguan Fangkou

299
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,880
Jujube, you are such a big group of people

300
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,640
Follow her all the time without being found

301
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,840
What a fool to follow her

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Think I'm just like you

303
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,400
This big gold wire sleeve mouth

304
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,040
There are sugar balls and little six children staring at them

305
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,600
Into the big gold wire sleeve

306
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,439
Qiu Zi basks in the sun there every day

307
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,199
Zhou Ping passed before her eyes

308
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,719
So she saw it really

309
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,320
Into the small gold wire sleeve

310
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,400
Grandpa Tang's garage is over there

311
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,479
Nan Guan Fang Kou

312
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
Grandpa Zhao pops popcorn there every day

313
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,120
Besides

314
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,800
Master Yan who grinds scissors and grabs kitchen knives

315
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,680
Walk along this alley every day

316
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
I saw her too

317
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,760
Let me just tell you this

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,360
No matter what it is, it is a big gold sleeve and a small gold sleeve

319
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,200
Nan Guan Fang Kou

320
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Inclined street around cigarette bags

321
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Just this piece of streets and alleys

322
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,920
There are all my people

323
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,720
She can't escape from my sight wherever she goes

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Then tell us quickly

325
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,120
Where did Zhou Ping go in the end

326
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,080
She went from the south official room to the north official room

327
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,040
Entering No.6, Beiguanfangkou

328
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
That's a single family

329
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
I heard it was a Kuomintang officer before that

330
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,040
Where to live

331
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
Later, before the liberation of Peiping, he ran away

332
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,680
Finally, a man lived in

333
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
But I don't know what that man is doing

334
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,680
Do you know what the vast sea of the masses is

335
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,040
This is the strength of the broad masses of the people

336
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,080
Jujube, you have made great contributions

337
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
On behalf of the organization, I thank you very much

338
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
Don't you thank me

339
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank me for such a thing. Why are you polite?

340
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,280
Operation Dapeng

341
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,760
Yes

342
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,320
Run fast

343
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,400
Don't move, don't move

344
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,480
Go

345
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,560
Go

346
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,200
Your mouth is tight enough

347
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,680
Don't say a word

348
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,560
Don't mention it

349
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,680
There is definitely no good end to holding back

350
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,360
If you don't say it, you can promise

351
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,680
Your associates won't confess either

352
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
I never expected it

353
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,600
I can't believe you are also a spy

354
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
The surname Mu

355
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
You're an old man in our bureau, aren't you

356
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Do you know

357
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,280
You almost got me killed

358
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,760
Qin section chief, I am also forced to be helpless

359
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,560
Cut the crap

360
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
What does it mean to be forced to do nothing

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Honestly confess

362
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,040
Did you kill Zhou Ping

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
Play steel fork with me

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,440
Old boy

365
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,680
You don't know what I do

366
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,880
I have plenty of ways to make you open your mouth

367
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,160
These dog spies have not been completely abandoned twice

368
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll tell you what

369
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,520
This man is easy to carry

370
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,640
As long as it is two people, no one can carry it

371
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,400
Okay, okay, okay, okay

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,680
This is based on Xu Ming's confession

373
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,800
There are also two lurking agents in this hospital

374
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,880
I have informed this city bureau to arrest people

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
In addition, according to Xu Ming,

376
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,280
There is also an important figure Zheng Qiang

377
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
This person is their online line

378
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,800
It is also from this Beiping spy organization

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,240
One of the important responsible persons

380
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,040
What a pity

381
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,680
According to this Xu Ming,

382
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
This Zheng Qiang is elusive

383
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
He doesn't know his whereabouts either

384
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,720
But what about this situation

385
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,240
I will report to the city bureau

386
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,760
City-wide arrest

387
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,600
Kobayashi, this case is beautifully handled

388
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,320
Thanks to the good leadership and guidance,

389
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,440
I haven't learned to speak Mandarin for two days since I went to town

390
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
Come and sit down

391
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,880
The reason why you can solve this case

392
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,360
It fully embodies the mobilization of the people

393
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,560
Rely on the strength of the broad masses of the people

394
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
The importance of fighting a national war

395
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,440
This time I finally realized

396
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,880
The important meaning of Chairman Mao's words

397
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,440
Don't be complacent

398
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
The current situation is still grim

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
I asked you to come today

400
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,000
First, listen to your report

401
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
The second is to inform you

402
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,480
According to our monitoring of enemy stations,

403
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,040
Get an important situation

404
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
It won't be long before

405
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,600
Will usher in an important celebration of our party

406
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,280
There will be many celebrations in the whole city

407
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,640
There will be many important leaders attending at that time

408
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
We got accurate information

409
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,840
The Kuomintang sent spies

410
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,000
To carry out a large-scale assassination

411
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,400
Catch this group and sneak into Peiping

412
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,880
The spy who carried out the assassination

413
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,880
Is your imminent task

414
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,040
Is there anything about this

415
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,200
What about the specific situation of the spy

416
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,320
I don't know much about the current situation

417
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,480
Look at this information first

418
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,520
Lin Zheng about cracking this case

419
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,240
We find that at work

420
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,160
There are still many loopholes

421
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,600
First of all, some time ago,

422
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,760
Large-scale inventory of accounts carried out

423
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,240
The household registration materials are confused and unclear

424
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,160
Of the people left over from the old government that we use

425
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
There are still latent agents

426
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
Next step

427
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,360
We must mobilize the broad masses of the people in depth

428
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,640
Improve the construction of our party's grass-roots organizations

429
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,960
Play their part

430
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,760
Quickly eliminate latent agents

431
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,040
Understand

432
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,240
For those who have made great meritorious deeds this time,

433
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Comrade Tian Zao

434
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
You're going to honor her

435
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,120
Let the general public know

436
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,760
Work for the Party and the State

437
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Have a sense of honor and responsibility

438
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,680
Let them know

439
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,040
They are the real masters of the country

440
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,160
Yes

441
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,240
Sister Hong Ying and Director Lin

442
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,960
I heard that I found spy Zhou Ping

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,120
When the action track is taken,

444
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
It's all silly

445
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,840
You didn't look at that look

446
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,920
That is

447
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
These government cadres are all from outside

448
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,320
How can you be familiar with your land

449
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Aunt, you are really right

450
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
He showed me the map

451
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Do you think I need to see that thing

452
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,440
Our Shichahai

453
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,920
Streets, alleys and hutongs

454
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,920
It's all engraved in my mind

455
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,280
I'll just scratching the vernacular

456
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
Give them vernacular dizzy

457
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,800
Jujube

458
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,920
You said you could find all these people

459
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
Keep an eye on this Zhou Ping for you

460
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,600
This is really a big battle, isn't it

461
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
Treat others

462
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
It's really a difficult thing

463
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,480
Treat us with jujube

464
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Isn't that just a matter of one sentence

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,680
Third brother, you are right about this

466
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
It's not difficult

467
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,880
I just talk to my uncle and aunt

468
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
Said hello

469
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
It's done

470
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Jujube, can you really

471
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,320
That is, you see heaven and earth

472
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,800
Hutong strings running wildly outside

473
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,760
I know everyone well

474
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,920
It can't be done with anyone else

475
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,480
Not the fourth brother

476
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,600
I don't like it when you say that

477
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
What hutong string

478
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,360
Who is the hutong string?

479
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,280
Look at that

480
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,160
Say you are an alley string

481
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
This is a compliment to you

482
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
You're going to change my fourth brother

483
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,680
I don't have time to string it if I want to

484
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,440
That's true

485
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,080
Is Jujube there

486
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,840
Is Xiaozao at home

487
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,360
They're all here

488
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,080
What's the task of Sister Hongying again

489
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,440
The child

490
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,600
How can there be so many tasks

491
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
I came here today to inform you

492
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,200
The case is solved

493
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,000
The spies are all caught

494
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,680
Oh, that's great. That's good

495
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,080
The leaders of the Municipal Military Management Committee gave special instructions

496
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,360
It is necessary to commend those involved in solving crimes

497
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,600
You're the first

498
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,960
The bureau decided

499
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,440
I'm going to give you a certificate of merit and hang a big red flower

500
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
Great Jujube Sister

501
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,760
Sister Zao, you have become a hero

502
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
What kind of hero will you become after you have passed

503
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm telling you, Sister Red Tassel

504
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
I just open my mouth and run errands

505
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,560
Don't be

506
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,600
Don't give out any awards, big red flowers

507
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,720
I also know modesty

508
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,080
It's not like you

509
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,080
Not Sister Red Tassel

510
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm really not modest

511
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,480
What kind of awards, big red flowers

512
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,600
These things should not be eaten or drunk

513
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,720
Why don't you just

514
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,480
Just approve me as a street activist

515
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,960
This is still affordable

516
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,520
Climb along the pole hey

517
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,600
When the commendation meeting is over,

518
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,480
I will apply to the higher-level government

519
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,240
You street activist

520
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,200
It's close

521
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,840
Good

522
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,120
Good boy

523
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,600
Thank you

524
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,320
Hospital murder successfully solved

525
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,440
Xu Ming and other spies were arrested one after another

526
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,120
In recognition of this action,

527
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,840
Comrade Tian Zao with outstanding performance

528
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
The government decided to award

529
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,480
Everybody applaud

530
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,760
Good good

531
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,280
Jujube

532
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,280
Thank you

533
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
I'll kick you to death

534
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,360
Qin Defu

535
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,440
You think you put on your military uniform

536
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
I don't know you, do I

537
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,160
Qin Defu

538
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Jujube

539
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,440
Jujube

540
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,600
Why is this? She Qin Defu

541
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
You stop for me

542
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,400
Sister

543
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,200
Jujube

544
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,800
Qin Defu got out

545
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Jujube

546
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,600
Qin Defu

547
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Sister

548
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
Sister, sister, kill this bad guy

549
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,680
Sister

550
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,840
Jujube comes back

551
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,880
Sister sister killed you

552
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,720
What's the matter with you being so impulsive? You

553
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
Sister, you don't know

554
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,760
This Qin Defu is from the original police station

555
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Pseudo-police

556
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,800
It is he who is with Han Qingkui

557
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,240
Who put my dad in jail

558
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Then my father died in prison

559
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,080
He's a murderer

560
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,800
He's the one who killed my dad

561
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,960
I am really wronged

562
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,160
That's right

563
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,720
I put Tian Zao's father in prison

564
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,240
But at that time, I couldn't help myself

565
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
Na Han Qingkui

566
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,480
Is the big bully in our place

567
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,840
He and our chief are sworn brothers again

568
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
You said our chief asked me to catch it

569
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Do I dare not go

570
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,400
Then Tian Zao's father died in prison

571
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,880
Did you do it

572
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,520
Heaven and earth conscience

573
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,600
I've been working with you for so long

574
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Am I that kind of person

575
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,120
Again

576
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,520
I was born in hardship, too

577
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
How can I get that black hand?

578
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,880
It was Han Qingkui who sent his men to prison

579
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,880
Directly killed Tian Zao's father

580
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,520
We also dare to be angry and dare not speak

581
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,400
This is a misunderstanding

582
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
I am really wronged

583
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,080
There can be no misunderstanding

584
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,080
I'm telling you

585
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,680
He just lied to you

586
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,920
My father died at his hands

587
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,520
I don't understand if I don't

588
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,080
Why did you shoot this Han Qingkui

589
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
Reuse this Qin Defu again

590
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,040
Isn't your Communist Party the Party of the People

591
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,920
Tian Zao Tian Zao, don't shout yet

592
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Will you hear me out

593
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm telling you

594
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
I won't listen when you talk to him

595
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,360
I won't turn to anyone

596
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,520
But our Communist Party screened cadres

597
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
Is principled

598
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,480
We made an in-depth investigation of Qin Defu

599
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,880
He is also from a bitter background

600
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,880
But now it proves that your father was arrested

601
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,960
He is completely following the orders of his superiors

602
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,800
But your father's death

603
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,040
It has nothing to do with him

604
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,760
Han Qingkui sent his men to do it

605
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,960
And after Qin Defu's liberation,

606
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,000
Be very active in your work

607
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,640
There is no anti-government and anti-party

608
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,720
Anti-state behavior

609
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,880
This time, I went to Jingxian County, Hebei Province to transfer to Zhou Ping

610
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,520
He is the one who went

611
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,360
He is a good man

612
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,360
Jujube

613
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,040
Good

614
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,120
Row

615
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,360
Row

616
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,880
He is a good man

617
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,520
Then you treat me like a bad person

618
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Xiaozao Xiaozao, don't go, Xiaozao

619
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,600
Why is this little girl so hot-tempered

620
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
Why don't you talk about it at all

621
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,160
Come on, Lao Lin

622
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,280
You calm down first

623
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,440
Jujube is a bitter child

624
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,720
With these bullies in the old society

625
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
There is a deep hatred

626
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,840
Plus, she has no culture

627
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
In this case

628
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,680
What can she tell you

629
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
But such a good commendation meeting

630
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,960
It was completely stirred up by her

631
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,600
How much impact this has on the people

632
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,440
What do people think of our government

633
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,800
That's also true

634
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,360
Since the shooting of Han Qingkui,

635
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,560
This girl has always been very active

636
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,240
Want to take part in government work

637
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,440
Our street government

638
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,840
I was going to reuse her

639
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Reuse her

640
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Red tassel, I'm telling you

641
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,160
This child is a treasure when he uses it well

642
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,560
If you don't use it well, it is a time bomb

643
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,000
Maybe it will blow up sometime

644
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,560
Think twice, you

645
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,880
Jujube this matter today

646
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,680
You're really overdoing it. You shut up

647
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,440
Don't say what I don't like to hear

648
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm telling you the truth

649
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
Today is the commendation meeting of the government

650
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,560
There are all neighborhoods sitting underneath

651
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
You made a scene and beat Qin Defu violently

652
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,800
Aren't you punching the Communist Party in the face

653
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
My eyes are red when I look at Qin Defu

654
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
How could I have thought so much

655
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,840
Didn't that director Lin say it

656
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,160
Qin Defu didn't kill my master

657
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't care if he did it or not

658
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,960
He's the one who took my dad

659
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,440
The Communist Party just can't use such people

660
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,520
That's no good. What can you do

661
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,680
What's the matter

662
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
I can't spare this Qin

663
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,120
I can warn you.

664
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
It can be liberated now

665
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,840
You mustn't fool around

666
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm too lazy to tell you

667
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,040
Why are you following me

668
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
I didn't just follow you

669
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,280
These two days

670
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
And I'm not going anywhere

671
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,800
I'll watch over you

672
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
Save you from doing something out of line

673
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,640
Love follow

674
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,640
I said

675
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,640
Before the liberation of this surname Qin, he was a fox and a tiger

676
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,920
This bully

677
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,280
It serves him right to hit him

678
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,960
That's right

679
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,080
People have surrendered now

680
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,800
Working for the Communist Party

681
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,800
I heard that I caught a spy

682
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,840
I have made a lot of achievements

683
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,000
No matter how you say it

684
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Jujube is just this

685
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,680
In our Shichahai area,

686
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,480
That's a big face

687
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,040
Jujube

688
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,880
Cattle

689
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,200
Here comes the iron egg

690
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,000
What's the matter

691
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,080
I said jujube

692
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,480
Don't listen to him

693
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,280
He will heckle and raise seedlings

694
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
Iron Jujube Egg

695
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,760
Let your uncle later

696
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,280
I'll make you delicious food.

697
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,759
Shirley, you go to the precinct later

698
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,880
Do me a favor

699
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
What is it, Sister Zao

700
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
You help me get that big red flower and the certificate back

701
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,120
Is that all right

702
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,680
Row

703
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,880
Your certificate of merit

704
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,920
Don't they all hit the Qin directly

705
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,240
Why do you want it? Return it

706
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,080
One thing belongs to one yard

707
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,319
That's a reward for my meritorious service from the branch office

708
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:46,960
I have to keep it

709
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,240
I'll get it right away

710
00:34:58,799 --> 00:34:59,359
Talk about it

711
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,400
What does it say on it

712
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
You read it to me

713
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:05,520
Certificate of merit

714
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,640
Comrade Tian Zao cracked the hospital assassination case

715
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,720
Have outstanding meritorious service

716
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,040
Give a reward for this

717
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,400
This is hereby issued as an encouragement

718
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Beiping Municipal People's government Public Security Bureau

719
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,640
How come you're not angry

720
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,000
Why don't you hurry back to your kennel

721
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm going to bed with coal core

722
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,240
Don't let me leave when the time comes

723
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
You really think I'm stupid

724
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm going to kill that Qin now

725
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,120
Am I not a counter-revolutionary

726
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,520
I really thought I was a simpleton

727
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,880
I'm much more down-to-earth if I have to have you.

728
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,000
Then I'm leaving

729
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,760
Early tomorrow morning

730
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
I'll take you and coal core to breakfast

731
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,320
Go away

732
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,840
Sister, you make this noise

733
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,760
Can the Communist Party still have you

734
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,200
Do you want me

735
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,960
I have to think about it

736
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,280
Do you want to do something for them

737
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,240
Do you want me

738
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
Sleep and sleep. Go to your sleep

739
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,720
Jujube

740
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,360
You see, you see the rouge

741
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,480
Do you like it

742
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
I don't wear this

743
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,560
Put it down, put it down

744
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,080
You're a big girl

745
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,440
Don't act like a tomboy all day

746
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,960
Which girl doesn't love beauty

747
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Why don't you think I'm ugly?

748
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,480
Think I'm ugly and find someone else

749
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,520
Do you know how to chat

750
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,880
Who thinks you are ugly

751
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
Besides

752
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,520
Who else can I call?

753
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,520
Give it to me

754
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,240
How much is it

755
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,200
Jujube

756
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,600
Coal core

757
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
Picked up so many coals

758
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,000
You can

759
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,600
What do you mean

760
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,560
I want to change something delicious

761
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,000
Smelly boy

762
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,720
Doing business with me at this age, don't you

763
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
Wait

764
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
Look what this is

765
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,400
Don't be so dirty

766
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,520
Look at you

767
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
The soil and coal slag in this body

768
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,600
This little face is as dirty as an imp

769
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,360
Let's wash it first

770
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Let's eat it when we wash it.

771
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,840
Pay attention to people

772
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,200
Suo Ye

773
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,600
Come here early in the morning to have fun

774
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,120
The girls are still asleep

775
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,760
I'll send Chunxi something delicious

776
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,480
You are really a kind of lover

777
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,080
De Chunxi is asleep

778
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,440
You give it to me. I'll give it later

779
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,120
Here you are

780
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
You can give me a secret like a cat later

781
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
Why don't I open my eyes so much

782
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,760
Just you poor people

783
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
What can you have to eat

784
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,240
I still want to touch you

785
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,840
Don't you just want to see Chun-hee

786
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
Come with money at night

787
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,480
Give me a calm breath

788
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
What a handsome child

789
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,320
Wait a minute

790
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,360
Come with me

791
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,280
Sit here

792
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,200
Don't eat yet

793
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,760
After your big brother plays it for you,

794
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,280
Take you out to eat delicious food

795
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,280
Brother Tong, what are you pretending to be today

796
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,400
Is it Hu Sanniang or Su San

797
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,240
Just leave it alone

798
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,040
What about today

799
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,800
I'll play you as a Wang Baochuan who keeps the cold kiln hard

800
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,440
Brother Tong

801
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
Then what does Wang Baochuan do

802
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
Don't worry

803
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,560
Listen to me tell you slowly

804
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,760
This Wang Baochuan

805
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,880
It was the third daughter of Wang Yun, the prime minister of the Tang Dynasty

806
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,120
She has a lover named Xue Pinggui

807
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,440
Or is it not particularly accurate

808
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,080
I think we may have to count it again

809
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,200
Red Tassel Sister

810
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,040
Jujube

811
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,320
Jujube jujube

812
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,600
She, she, she has a stomachache

813
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,360
I went to the toilet

814
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
Is she avoiding me

815
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,000
It seems to be a little

816
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,360
Go on, you go on

817
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,800
Jujube jujube

818
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,560
What's going on, Jujube

819
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,840
No

820
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,280
Why did you run when you saw Sister Hongying

821
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
What did I say when I saw her

822
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,800
Embarrassment

823
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,560
Jujube

824
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,560
Do you know

825
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,160
The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou campaign of the Communist Party has already started

826
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,240
Shanghai will soon be occupied by the Communist Party

827
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,320
Emancipate the whole of China

828
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,360
Emancipate the whole of China

829
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,080
It's just around the corner

830
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,560
How do you know

831
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,080
What don't I know

832
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,560
You remember it anyway

833
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
The Communist Party will rule the world in the future

834
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,240
Get on well with people in the government

835
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
There is no loss for you

836
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,080
Good good

837
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,160
Look at this look

838
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,720
This figure

839
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,920
This is really the ancestor's reward for food

840
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,040
Don't give food to your ancestors, Big Brother

841
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,640
Give me a meal first
