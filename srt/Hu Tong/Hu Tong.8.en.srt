1
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,160
Don't believe me, Suo Qian can't earn money

2
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,000
Chun Xi

3
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,360
I have to redeem you

4
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,160
Why don't you ask Ye for this

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Gong Er Ge Liu San Di

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,240
Suo Ye Suo Ye

7
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,440
Why are you two

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,880
Aren't you two mixed up in Tianjin Wharf

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Why did you jump to Beijing?

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,360
Let me tell you something

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,880
Just the two of us

12
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,600
Don't talk here

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
It's inconvenient to talk here

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,680
Go and find a pub

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,680
Second brother buys you a drink

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
That's nice

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
Walk

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Walk

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Why are you here? Yeah

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
Come on, come on

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Suo Ye Suo Ye Suo Ye

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,880
Suo Ye

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
How did you get into such bad luck

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Is

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,640
It's a long story. It's a long story

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Tell me something about it

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,000
Gong Er Ge

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,440
Liu San Di

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
Look at your outfits

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,120
Sent

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
Second brother, did you see it

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,440
I'll just say Suo Ye has eye poison

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
See we sent it

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Our brothers are coming back to Beijing

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,600
From doing business

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
We stayed at the Six Nations Hotel

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
What a thing

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
Six Nations Hotel

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
That's where foreigners live

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,360
Right

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,800
Sure

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
Come on, come on, come on, come on

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,560
How did you two make your fortune

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,960
I also learn to learn long ability

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
Tell him about it

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,440
Chanting and chanting

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,240
Hanging

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Look at that

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,840
Upper eye

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,320
Isn't this a pill

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,280
Suo Ye

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
It's New China now

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,800
The Communist Party vigorously banned smoking

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,440
Think about it

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
Those heavy smokers

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Is it time to quit

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,680
Yeah

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,880
So our brothers are in Tianjin

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,760
I met a big German businessman

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
From him

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,960
Got a batch of these non-smoking pills

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
Let me tell you something

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
Eat this thing

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,840
Go down with one pill

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,400
Immediately, all the snot and saliva stopped flowing

66
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
Is this medicine so divine

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Do not believe

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Try it if you don't believe me

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,560
Alternative price

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,040
This

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, he doesn't smoke big cigarettes either

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
It's no use tasting it

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the country

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,400
Isn't this a Chinese character for you

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,520
How did this change to be imported from Germany

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,480
I said do you understand

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm telling you

78
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,760
This is for us to promote this medicine

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
Post-added packaging

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,600
Just for this wrapping paper

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
I spent my old nose money

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,360
Really

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,680
Seriously

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm telling you

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,520
The two of us came to Beijing this time

86
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Is to promote this medicine

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Do you understand

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Then this is a good thing

89
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
Just

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,280
Now the Communist Party is collecting opium everywhere

91
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,280
These are the big smokers

92
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
There is almost no way to live

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm dying

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,760
With this medicine,

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
How many people have to be saved

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,640
Not only how many people are saved

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,640
This medicine has sold well

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,440
You're getting big now

99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,520
You will be big

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Do you understand

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,040
Suo Ye

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Back then

103
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,600
You are also a famous eater and player in Beijing

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,640
That is

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,080
Shops around Beijing

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,360
You are all familiar with it

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,080
That's right

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Or

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
You help us both

110
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Go to the shops

111
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
Sell the medicine

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,200
Is it okay

113
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,680
You sell to us

114
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,520
Then please ask

115
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
I sell this pill

116
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
How much money can I get

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,080
This is a smoking cessation medicine

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
Life-saving

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Ten pills for one ocean

120
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,880
Give you 10%

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,120
10%

122
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,520
This is also very rare

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,320
What's the matter? It has to be opened in four or six

124
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,880
Is it open in four or six

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
I said Suo Ye

126
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,840
Just talk to this

127
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,360
You take four

128
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,760
The rest is not enough for us brothers

129
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,320
That's a little copy

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,080
Is

131
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,440
How can there be such a thing as you

132
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,840
Or

133
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,120
I said Suo Ye

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
At the end of the day

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,680
This Suo Ye is no outsider

136
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,920
After all, we are on the border of Tianjin

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,320
They all mixed up together

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,040
So here's the deal

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Twenty percent

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm telling you

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,160
Want to talk about half more

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Don't talk

143
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
I answered

144
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
Come on, come on

145
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,280
Dry, dry, dry

146
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,640
That's all right. Okay, okay

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,800
Come on, come on

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,960
Good

149
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Zhou Shuqiang

150
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Wei Dakui

151
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Gao Ren

152
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
Zhang Fengying

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,200
Zhou Shuqiang

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
Jujube

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,520
Jujube

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Wei Dakui

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,680
You see you're happy

158
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Am I right

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,400
I really chose you

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Elder sister

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,480
When do I take part in the work

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Don't worry

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,280
Newly elected street activists

164
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,560
There are still some formalities to go through

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
To work formally

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
Yes, yes, yes, you have to sign that and what document

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
I have to press a handprint

168
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
Then I became an activist

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
What specific position do I have

170
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,080
It's not as complicated as you think

171
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
Street activists

172
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
It is a mass autonomous organization

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,240
One is not being compiled

174
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,720
There is no specific position

175
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
Second, there is no salary

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,360
But I will send you some rice and noodles

177
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,120
As compensation

178
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't want money

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,680
I told you

180
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
My Tian Zao can do something for the neighbors

181
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm happy in my heart

182
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
It's great that you have this awareness

183
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,479
Come on, don't worry

184
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,479
Go back and wait for the news

185
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,400
In a couple of days

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,480
I organized a meeting for everyone

187
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,240
Assign work

188
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,079
Get it

189
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,120
Slow down a bit

190
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,400
This girl

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,120
Boss, do you think this stupid meatball can quit smoking

192
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,360
What

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Broken balls

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
This is what Suo Ye asked us to sell on a commission basis

195
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,160
German goods

196
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Suo Ye

197
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
On the flag

198
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,640
Ancestors are also official families

199
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
This man has special eyes

200
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
What he identified as

201
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,880
That's right

202
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Boss

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,640
Boss

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you have any smoking cessation pills

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
You have you

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
Give me some quickly

207
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,680
Good good

208
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,720
Give me some

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
It's all, it's all, it's all

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay, okay, don't worry, don't worry

211
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,520
Go

212
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,880
What do you think

213
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,960
It's really amazing

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
What time is it now

215
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
When the whole people quit smoking,

216
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,280
Whoever has it must be rich

217
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,680
This Suo Ye really has a way

218
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,400
Right

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Thank you, Suo Ye

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,680
Thank you, Suo Ye

221
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,840
Thank you thank you

222
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Tomorrow

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,080
The next drugstore

224
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,920
Keep going

225
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Good start

226
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
Thank you, Suo Ye. Thank you, Suo Ye. Thank you

227
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,600
Gong Er Ge

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Liu San Di

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,240
You guys wait for me

230
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm going to collect money now

231
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,960
No, no, no, wait a minute

232
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,400
Don't worry, Suo Ye

233
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,240
It's stretched

234
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,600
Go again tomorrow

235
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,520
Warmly welcome our street activists

236
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,040
Comrade Tian Zao returned to the government

237
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,520
Come

238
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,240
Welcome, welcome, warm welcome

239
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Welcome, welcome, warm welcome

240
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,400
Welcome, welcome, warm welcome

241
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,120
You received the letter so soon

242
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,760
Sister, as soon as you announced this,

243
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
The neighbors came back to report the good news for us

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,800
You street activist

245
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,040
How many officials are counted

246
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Aunt Li has no taste

247
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Sister Hongying said it

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,720
We do things for the common people

249
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,480
So there is no product

250
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Isn't that the chief of Class Three

251
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,680
Chief

252
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,480
So ugly

253
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,920
Activists

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,800
Right to right activists

255
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,280
Elder sister

256
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
How much do you make as an activist

257
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,920
Smelly boy knows money

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm telling you, no money

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
But what about the government

260
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
Will send some food as supplies

261
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,080
Sure

262
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
It is more affordable to give food than money these days

263
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Jujube for celebration

264
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
You can be a government man

265
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,360
Guess what your uncle can do with me

266
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Make good food

267
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,760
Right

268
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Good, good, I can eat delicious food again

269
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,920
Just you little greedy cat

270
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,560
Why didn't this third brother Suo come

271
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,880
This ran out early in the morning

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,720
I haven't seen anyone yet

273
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,920
I don't know where I've been fooling around again

274
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
Let's eat first

275
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't wait for him

276
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,520
Come

277
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,280
Come on, come on

278
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,760
Make room, make room

279
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,640
Okay, this

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,080
Jujube is ok

281
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,800
Hard dish

282
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,760
It's really hard

283
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,280
Where's Shirley

284
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,880
Why didn't Xiulan come

285
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
She went out on some errands

286
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
I'll be back in a minute

287
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
Let's go, Brother Iron Egg

288
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,960
What's the matter

289
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
Why don't you go in

290
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,720
Xiulan

291
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,000
I'd better not go in there

292
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Not Brother Iron Egg

293
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
It's my sister today

294
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
A good day to be elected a street activist

295
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,400
My mom asked me to find you

296
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
Just to make you happy while she is happy

297
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
Give her a good compensation

298
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,280
I want to ease the relationship between you

299
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,400
How can you live up to my mother's wishes

300
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Yes

301
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,520
I know

302
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,920
I also understand Aunt Li's mind

303
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,680
But don't you know what kind of temper you have

304
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm afraid to catch up with this day

305
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
As soon as I showed up

306
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,560
Mixed up all the things that were good

307
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
That's not so good, is it

308
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,160
Hard to say

309
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,760
Maybe your jujube sister will give me another full martial arts

310
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,400
It's nothing if I get beaten up

311
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,800
But if it's because of me

312
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
Ruined everyone's fun

313
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,440
Then my sin would be great

314
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
I think it's better to forget it

315
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
How did you leave

316
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,200
Look at you like that

317
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,040
You come back

318
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,240
Shirley has been out for so long and hasn't come back yet

319
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,880
Why don't I go look for her

320
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,680
No, no, no

321
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
It's time to come back

322
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,520
Let's go and wait to eat

323
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,200
This, this, this

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,320
This dish is cold. It can't eat this, this and this

325
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's wait and eat together

326
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,000
Sit and sit

327
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,960
This, this, this

328
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,880
What did you go out for so long

329
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,200
Didn't you go to the neighbor's house just now

330
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,800
This is still waiting for me. I haven't eaten it

331
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
That's what you're saying

332
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,360
Today

333
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
We were elected street activists

334
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
A big day

335
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
I propose

336
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,280
This first glass of wine

337
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
Let's respect jujube

338
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,520
I wish our jujube officials prosperity and prosperity

339
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,440
I said boy boss

340
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,280
What kind of words are you talking about

341
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
You say that again

342
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,040
Then jujube should fly to the sky

343
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,600
Well, the higher you fly, the better

344
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
Not the fourth brother. I'm flying too high

345
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
What should I do if I fall down

346
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,400
There are us big guys

347
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
It's here for you to hold

348
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
You can't fall

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,920
Can't fall

350
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,320
Come on, come on

351
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Come and come

352
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Come on, come on

353
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Suo Ye

354
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,560
Success in the first battle

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Today's celebration dinner

356
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
Is it easy for you to eat

357
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Just so so

358
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,920
If you want to stay in this Six Kingdoms Hotel,

359
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,760
Then you have to eat foreign food and drink red wine

360
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,320
Come on, Suo Ye

361
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,800
You didn't eat less of this instant-boiled mutton either

362
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,000
Just the white wine

363
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
You drank most of the bottle by yourself. You

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,400
That meat is OK today

365
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,880
Although it can't compare with Donglaishun

366
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
It's not bad, is it

367
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,040
Get

368
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
You can eat happily

369
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,840
It's getting late, too

370
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,160
Where are you going home

371
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,280
We have a lot of things to do tomorrow

372
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
Have to be busy

373
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
This wine today

374
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
Suo Ye, I'm a little drunk

375
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,840
My head is dizzy now

376
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,800
What about me? I'm not going anywhere tonight

377
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Me, I also sleep in the bed of the Six Kingdoms Hotel

378
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,640
I said

379
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,680
Suo Ye

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,880
Suo Ye Suo Ye this

381
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,400
This

382
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,720
Don't sleep here

383
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,640
This is my bed

384
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
Where will I sleep if you sleep here

385
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,400
Not this, this

386
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,560
Three is on the sofa and enduring it

387
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,800
Make do with it for one night

388
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Get

389
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,720
Who told you to be a master

390
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,520
You rest

391
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,160
What do you think this iron egg is all about

392
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
Mom, don't mention it

393
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,400
Just the iron egg bag

394
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
I've already arrived at my doorstep just now

395
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
He turned and ran away

396
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,320
What are you running for

397
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
He said he was afraid to see Jujube again

398
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,280
Then Jujube Sister will be unhappy when the time comes

399
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Give him a beating

400
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,520
Doesn't that disturb everyone's game

401
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
You said this kid

402
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
Why is he so afraid of dates

403
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,560
What a good opportunity

404
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,840
Let him miss it again

405
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,120
What good opportunity let who give to miss

406
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
I said Suo Ye

407
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,120
Your uncle

408
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,760
I finally got a good table

409
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
This Suo Ye doesn't know where he has gone

410
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
Life is not eaten at all

411
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,040
This tomorrow, you must blame us

412
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,120
I didn't keep it for him

413
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,080
That's what he deserved.

414
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
It has nothing to do with us

415
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,880
Right, right, right, right, right

416
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,760
Suo Ye

417
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,480
You're here

418
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm looking forward to you here

419
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,399
How about my pill

420
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,640
That's great

421
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
Snatch and empty

422
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,319
I'm waiting for you to deliver the goods to me

423
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Am I right

424
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,319
This pill just works

425
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,000
How can you say it's a pill

426
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
The whole elixir

427
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
Suo Ye is telling you the truth

428
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,800
I'll take as much as you bring

429
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,720
I've got the whole elixir

430
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,960
Get

431
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Just have your words

432
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,520
But

433
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,040
That's all I bring today

434
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,840
Hurry up and have some money. Where are you

435
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
Okay okay okay okay

436
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Jujube and some water

437
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,560
It's a little thinner

438
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,040
Good

439
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
You, you're going the wrong way

440
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,560
Jujube

441
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,840
How

442
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,200
I don't know your third brother

443
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
Third brother, where did you steal this dress

444
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,680
No

445
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Why are you talking so unpopular

446
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,320
What do you mean, stealing

447
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,960
Your third brother, am I that kind of person

448
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
Seriously

449
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Customized by Guanqi Foreign Firm

450
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Do you understand

451
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
Suo Ye

452
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,280
I have, ah, I have

453
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,800
Kept

454
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,080
See if there is any meaning of model

455
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,840
There is the style of juggling

456
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,280
I haven't seen you for some days

457
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
You did send it

458
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
Earn a little, earn a little

459
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Tell us about where you made your fortune

460
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,240
See

461
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the country

462
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
Are you asking me?

463
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,320
Now answer the government's call

464
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,560
I changed to selling smoking cessation pills

465
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,840
All right

466
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,480
Suo Ye

467
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
This is a good thing to accumulate virtue and do good deeds

468
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,040
That is

469
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,040
Well done

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Dapeng Dapeng

471
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,880
Who is Suo Qian

472
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,840
Report, officer. I'm Suoqian

473
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,000
What's wrong with you

474
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,360
Are you here to praise me

475
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,600
By the way, send a certificate of merit

476
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
What award

477
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,080
Take away

478
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,440
No

479
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,080
What are you doing

480
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm telling you, the flood washed the Dragon King Temple

481
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,560
A family doesn't recognize a family

482
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,280
Is there a mistake

483
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,440
I also work for the government

484
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,880
I'm from the house

485
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,960
Is there a mistake

486
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,680
How do you say take it away? Take it away

487
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,400
Me too

488
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,880
What does Jujube say

489
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
Go and have a look. Go and have a look

490
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
Go and have a look. Come on, come on

491
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Give it to me give it to me

492
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,200
Really

493
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,360
This Suo Ye

494
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,080
There is really no regular shape

495
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
There must be something wrong again

496
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
It's really not worrying

497
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,080
Our branch office has now received reports from the masses

498
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
Say this is on the market

499
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Someone sells fake smoking cessation drugs

500
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
There are many owners of this drugstore

501
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,000
Report these fake smoking cessation drugs

502
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
Suo Qian sold them all

503
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,320
Suo Qian told them

504
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,560
He imported this smoking cessation drug from Germany

505
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,880
And let some smokers take care of it

506
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,480
Causing these drugstore owners to be deceived

507
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,280
In fact, these so-called German imported smoking cessation drugs

508
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,480
It's just some ordinary hawthorn pills

509
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,200
Secretary Lam

510
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,840
Suo Qian is my third brother and my neighbor

511
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
He is a man who eats it and smells good

512
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,080
What's the matter? A bastard who doesn't work

513
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,240
You said he dared to cheat money with fake drugs

514
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,000
Destroy the government's campaign against smoking

515
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,560
He really doesn't have the guts

516
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,320
Let me tell you something

517
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,960
According to this Suoqian confession,

518
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,360
His fake smoking cessation pills

519
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,440
Both of them met two gangsters in Tianjin

520
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
One is Gong Er

521
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,480
A man named Liu San

522
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
Let him sell it

523
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,680
According to the situation we have, what about

524
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Suo Qian was also deceived

525
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,600
But his behavior is extremely bad

526
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,400
Caused a very bad influence

527
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,960
It is a typical fraudster

528
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,040
Now the principal offenders are Gong Er and Liu San

529
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Has escaped

530
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,960
We have sent people to Tianjin to arrest them

531
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
After catching it, it will be processed together

532
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
Then since you know that Soqian was deceived,

533
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,280
He is also a victim

534
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
What is the government going to do with him

535
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,120
According to the present situation,

536
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
Suoqian should be sentenced

537
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,640
How long will it take

538
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
At least half a year

539
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,640
Tian Zao

540
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
You have now been elected as a street activist

541
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,840
There are some words I must give you

542
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,560
What do you say

543
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,240
State-owned legalists have family rules

544
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
You can't make a square without rules

545
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,240
You work for the government now

546
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
You should study our party's policies well

547
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Be disciplined

548
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
You can't be like before

549
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,320
Let your temper fool around

550
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,360
Your sister Hongying values you very much

551
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,600
Don't you always make trouble with her

552
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
Who's causing trouble

553
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,200
Look at it

554
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
What are you talking about

555
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,480
Didn't say anything

556
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,600
Of course, you also have your advantages

557
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,600
What about you? You work very actively

558
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,000
This has a good mass base

559
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,440
In every case we solve,

560
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,200
You played a very important role

561
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,440
So Comrade Tian Zao

562
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,560
I hope you will work in the future

563
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,960
You should foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses

564
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,160
Be a qualified street activist

565
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,800
I know

566
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,760
You can rest assured

567
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,280
Now New China has just been founded

568
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,440
Everything is in ruins

569
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,800
Peiping is still not peaceful

570
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,000
There are also a large number of Kuomintang latent agents

571
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,720
In activity

572
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
We still have your red tassel sister

573
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,640
The burden is still heavy

574
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,000
I want you to be your red tassel sister

575
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
A pair of eyes beside me

576
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,480
Once you find any suspicious molecules,

577
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
You should report to me and your sister Hongying in time

578
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
That's right

579
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,280
It suddenly occurred to me that something happened

580
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,440
I forgot if you didn't tell me

581
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,400
What is it

582
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,280
That day

583
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,120
At the celebration

584
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,560
When you arrested spy Luo Wenhui,

585
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,560
I saw a man

586
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,920
What person

587
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,840
That man, right

588
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,720
I look familiar

589
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,880
But I didn't think much about it at that time

590
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
I remembered when I got home

591
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,120
He was with me at the bully Han Qingkui's house

592
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,280
That's a person I saw

593
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,600
Why didn't you say so earlier

594
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,800
I just remembered

595
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Is it too late to say now

596
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,160
It's not too late

597
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,120
Then tell me in detail now

598
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,520
How did you see him

599
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,040
Aren't I going to kill Han Qingkui that day

600
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
As a result, I didn't kill him

601
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Instead, he took it back

602
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,800
Get this girl in the backyard

603
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,880
Bury

604
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,160
All right

605
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,520
Walk, walk

606
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Go fast

607
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,880
Come on, you

608
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,000
Walk

609
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,760
Go

610
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Walk faster

611
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,160
Go fast, go fast

612
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
At that time, I was beaten up

613
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,120
When you brought me out after typing,

614
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
Suddenly a man passed in front of me

615
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,280
When the man left,

616
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,000
I just took a glance

617
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
I didn't take it to heart

618
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
Make way, make way, make way

619
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,320
Where are the iron eggs

620
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,000
Chase

621
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,800
Go

622
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
So I'm sure

623
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,080
That must be a person

624
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,080
Tian Zao

625
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,200
Your clue is very important

626
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
Jujube in this field

627
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,800
You wait a minute

628
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,080
Old Qin

629
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,840
Secretary Lam

630
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,120
What about Dapeng? See

631
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,960
Dapeng went to the household to investigate Suo Qian's case

632
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,720
Then you come with me

633
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,160
Yes

634
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Come on, come on

635
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,200
Tian Zao, what you just said to me

636
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
Tell him again

637
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,480
Old Qin, please record it

638
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,800
I have finished what I should say

639
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,200
I have work to do. I'm leaving

640
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,920
Get out of the way

641
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,000
What kind of person

642
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,960
Come to Lao Qin and sit down

643
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,280
Director Lin, what's the matter

644
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,640
Tian Zao told me just now

645
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
On the eve of liberation

646
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,000
She saw a man in Han Qingkui's home

647
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,120
This man used to be on the day of the celebration

648
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
Luo Wenhui's assassination scene appeared

649
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,120
I saw it at the assassination scene

650
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,800
The man who once appeared at Han Qingkui's house

651
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,440
Secretary Lin, these two things

652
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,440
The time interval is not short

653
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
The time interval is not short

654
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,400
Could she have mistaken Tian Zao for someone else

655
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
Don't look at this girl

656
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,640
Other things are not reliable

657
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Things in this area are very clever

658
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
And the city bureau also reported it before

659
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
It has not been found so far

660
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,560
Assist in Luo Wenhui's assassination

661
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,280
Traces of Kuomintang spies codenamed Night Wolf

662
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,120
Since Tian Zao said this person

663
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,320
Was at the scene of this assassination

664
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,040
Then this man is probably the night wolf

665
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,680
And before

666
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,040
We are in this home of Han Qingkui

667
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,520
A large number of guns and ammunition were seized

668
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,200
According to this Han Qingkui,

669
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,560
The man who contacted him is Zheng Qiang

670
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
According to what you say

671
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,640
This night wolf is probably Zheng Qiang

672
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,240
So connect these two people together

673
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,520
You can implement your identity

674
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,960
If this Zheng Qiang is the night wolf

675
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,600
So this wolf

676
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,800
You can't hide for long

677
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,480
That's enough

678
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
I have understood everything everyone said

679
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,720
Is there anything else to add

680
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,160
This comrade

681
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,640
Although Brother Suo usually doesn't do things in tune,

682
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
But he's a good man

683
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
This girl

684
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,000
Chairman Mao said

685
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,160
Everything must see the essence through phenomena

686
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,840
We should look at it in two ways

687
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,760
Good people do bad things

688
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
This is dialectics

689
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,560
That's enough

690
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Since you have nothing to add,

691
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
Let's call it a day

692
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,200
What's the problem after that

693
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,560
I'll ask you for advice again

694
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,800
Good

695
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,560
Young man, why don't you drink some water before you go

696
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,560
No, aunt

697
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,600
There are still things to do at the bureau

698
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,680
I have to hurry back

699
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,120
Good

700
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,440
You have to work hard

701
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,360
Take your time

702
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Tell me about this Suo Ye

703
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,040
What kind of life is it? He

704
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,040
It was finally liberated

705
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
After two good days,

706
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,960
He has done something unreliable again

707
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,840
The nature of money fans will not change

708
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,720
He doesn't earn money for

709
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,360
Redeem his sister with small coal core

710
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,800
I just didn't take the right path

711
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,040
Comrade Dapeng said dialectics just now

712
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
Maybe he'll go to jail

713
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,120
I said

714
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,520
Fraudsters

715
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,800
This undermines the Communist Party's anti-smoking campaign

716
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
This crime is not small

717
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
It's a good sentence

718
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
It's pathetic. This is

719
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,160
Okay, no, no, no

720
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Don't poke here

721
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,720
Hurry up and cook

722
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,280
He should be sentenced when he stands

723
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,480
Really do this person

724
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,800
Sister Zao, what are you knitting

725
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
It's cold. Knit a sweater

726
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
You don't weave it for Brother Iron Egg, do you

727
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,080
He thinks beautifully

728
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,200
What about the coals

729
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,400
Why didn't you see him

730
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,640
You didn't hear him squeak

731
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,040
Where does the boy boss practice

732
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,440
I didn't pay much attention

733
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
What's wrong with you, sister

734
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,800
I didn't hear you shouting so loudly

735
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,600
What's wrong with the slouch

736
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,400
Not much

737
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,000
Jujube sister

738
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,360
Let me ask you something

739
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,800
You said

740
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Haven't you been running the government lately

741
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,360
Do you know the policeman named Dapeng well

742
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,040
Cooked

743
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,800
And solved several cases with him

744
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,560
What about him

745
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,920
You don't have a crush on Dapeng, do you

746
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,320
Hate

747
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,720
I'll just ask

748
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You don't know him

749
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
I can't get anywhere

750
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,360
Why are you asking him

751
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,000
Didn't he come to the hospital today to investigate Brother Suo

752
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,520
I know each other now

753
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,120
I see

754
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Do you think he is good-looking

755
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,920
Move the flower heart

756
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,320
No, either

757
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,920
I

758
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm wondering anyway

759
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,120
You said he was such a warrior

760
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
How did he know so much

761
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,520
He said today

762
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,480
Say what

763
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,600
He said that looking at the essence through the phenomenon

764
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,600
He also said that we should look at the problem in two

765
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
What other dialectics is there

766
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,080
What's there to wonder about

767
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,080
I'm telling you

768
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,720
This roc is not simple

769
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
Sister Hongying told me

770
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,400
He is a student of Yenching University

771
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
During the War of Liberation

772
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,480
He also joined the revolutionary ranks

773
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,920
I've carried a gun and fought a war

774
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,680
He was also a fighting hero

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,960
It's so powerful

776
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,760
So you have a good eye

777
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
This Dapeng is really a good boy

778
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Nengwen Nengwu

779
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
Be talented with you

780
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,920
Perfect match

781
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,800
Sister, take care of it

782
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,280
Help you make a good match

783
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,040
No matchmaking, no matchmaking

784
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,840
Don't mention it

785
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,400
I really don't need it

786
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,440
I really don't need to save trouble

787
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,120
No

788
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Don't tease me, Sister Zao

789
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,160
Got it

790
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
Then I'll knit it for you

791
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,640
According to the clues provided by Director Lin,

792
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
We read the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

793
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,240
Archives of Beijing Railway Station

794
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,000
I found Zheng Qiang

795
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
This person is from Beijing Station of Secrecy Bureau

796
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,920
One of the important members

797
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,960
Is the head of Zheng Qiang's latent group

798
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,000
We also arraigned the sleeper agent in custody

799
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,360
Testified by many people

800
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
This Zheng Qiang

801
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,600
Is the spy code-named Night Wolf

802
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,680
It seems that Tian Zao is right

803
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,760
The wolf is finally coming to the surface

804
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,320
There is also an important link

805
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
We have to let Tian Zao, who provides clues,

806
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,480
To identify this man

807
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,400
Is she in Han Qingkui's house

808
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
And the man I met at the celebration

809
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,120
If it is confirmed to be Zheng Qiang

810
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,840
Then make the overall situation known

811
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,320
Find this Zheng Qiang all over the city

812
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,240
In this way

813
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,680
Xiao Sun

814
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,480
You'd better do the job

815
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
No, no, no

816
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,760
I, I dare not see Tian Zao now

817
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,240
She hates me to death

818
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
How long has it been

819
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,040
Plus your red tassel sister

820
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,240
Every day in front of that field jujube

821
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,200
Say something nice about you

822
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,120
You can't keep going like this

823
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,920
This is your chance

824
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Grasp it well

825
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,520
Go ahead

826
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,000
Jujube

827
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,040
Get out of here

828
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,040
No, no

829
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,720
You wait a minute

830
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I asked you to come this time

831
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,840
There is something serious to tell you

832
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,120
You see

833
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,400
You gotta get out of here

834
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,640
I really have business to do

835
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Go

836
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,800
Go quickly

837
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,160
Jujube

838
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,600
I really have business to see you this time

839
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,240
The bureau asked me to identify someone with you with photos

840
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,360
Is it really personal

841
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,800
I thought you said the last time

842
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,840
You are at Han Qingkui's house

843
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,120
Have you ever seen a spy

844
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,360
And the spy

845
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,880
And appeared at the assassination scene

846
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,120
My superiors sent me here this time

847
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
Is for you to identify

848
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,760
Is this the man in the photo

849
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Take a look at it

850
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,640
I have the picture in my hand

851
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,800
That's him

852
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,680
It's over

853
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,400
What are you doing

854
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,080
Get out of here when you're done

855
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,640
Can't you just give me a chance

856
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,840
Let me have a good chat with you

857
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,880
What do I have to talk to you about

858
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,040
Is it difficult

859
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
Do you want me to kneel for you?

860
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,400
Jujube

861
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,800
Almost got it

862
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,960
Come on, jujube

863
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes, Jujube Sister

864
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,120
Do you really ask Brother Iron Egg to kneel down for you

865
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,880
He can kneel if he wants to

866
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,360
I didn't make him kneel

867
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
How dare I kneel? Believe it or not

868
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,000
Men have gold under their knees

869
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
I really don't want this gold today

870
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm really on my knees

871
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,960
You

872
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
Don't stop me. I'm really kneeling.

873
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,440
Don't stop me

874
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm really kneeling. Look at you like that

875
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Go in, go in

876
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
Get in there

877
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,320
Go

878
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,039
How big is mom

879
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,399
Let's not listen here

880
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,640
Listen to what's going on

881
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:29,119
Jujube

882
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,840
Awesome

883
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,160
This can all write

884
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,319
Squeeze on who you are

885
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:39,958
Say the wrong thing again

886
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,719
Jujube

887
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,560
Let me report it to you

888
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:49,679
I am now

889
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Has arrived at the second section of the public security department of the municipal bureau

890
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,039
Officially became a police officer

891
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:56,398
You see

892
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,080
Look at it quickly

893
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
What you are willing to be, what you are willing to be

894
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,999
What does it have to do with me

895
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,040
Are you done

896
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
Say that finish and hurry away

897
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,640
I'm telling you, Ma Liuer

898
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,600
Roll as far as you can

899
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,200
There is no time to gossip about you

900
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't charge

901
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,400
I haven't finished saying this yet

902
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,080
Jujube

903
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,800
Heard

904
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,480
You have been selected as a street activist

905
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,920
You can

906
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,760
This is really a good thing

907
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,000
So that in the future, you

908
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,640
You can do something for the people

909
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,000
But

910
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,120
What about taking part in the work here

911
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,880
It's just the first step

912
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,240
The second step is to actively join the party

913
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,400
Strive to join the Party organization as soon as possible

914
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Do you need to say it

915
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,200
Why don't you do this

916
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
I am a Communist

917
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,200
I can be your party introducer

918
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,960
How is it

919
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,200
Can I use you

920
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
If I want to join the party,

921
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,680
Sister Hong Ying can be my party introducer

922
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,800
Can I use you

923
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,360
What are you doing

924
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,960
No, no, no

925
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,960
You don't like it either

926
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,760
Let me tell you about the case, okay

927
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,240
As far as this spy you recognized is concerned

928
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,320
His name is Zheng Qiang

929
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Code name Night Wolf

930
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,000
He is a big spy in Beijing Station of Secrecy Bureau

931
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,600
Just the last assassination case

932
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
He is responsible for coordinating Luo Wenhui

933
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
We are now

934
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,400
Going door-to-door throughout the city

935
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,720
Looking for his trail

936
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,760
I didn't say Sun

937
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,960
Aren't you organized and disciplined

938
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,520
Why are you telling me this

939
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,520
These words

940
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,600
Can I listen

941
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,280
Why can't I tell you

942
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,320
Who are you

943
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
You're my fiancee

944
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
Is my dearest and dearest person

945
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,280
Tell you what's wrong

946
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
Besides

947
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,760
This Zheng Qiang was identified by you

948
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
You're a street activist again

949
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,800
I'm telling you, it's not a leak

950
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
Okay, I got it. Let's go quickly

951
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,880
Jujube

952
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,360
You see

953
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,960
It's almost time for dinner, too

954
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:32,840
Or

955
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,160
Did I give you a face

956
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,880
Walk, walk

957
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,680
You won't leave me for a meal

958
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,400
Hurry up

959
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm hungry. Jujube

960
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,480
Come on, you're still hungry

961
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,120
Hurry up

962
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,600
Jujube is not

963
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,080
Go quickly

964
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:43,960
Fuck off

965
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm hungry

966
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,640
Starve you to death

967
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,360
You eat, you eat shit, you

968
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,120
You child

969
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
How do you talk

970
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,280
Tian Zao said it

971
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,640
This Zheng Qiang

972
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,160
That's where he was at the Han Fu and the celebration assassination scene

973
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,160
The man who saw it

974
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
Inform the city bureau immediately

975
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,080
In the whole city

976
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,480
Search for Zheng Qiang, the spy code-named Night Wolf

977
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,480
Yes

978
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,520
Sister sister

979
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
What's wrong with my sister? She panicked in a hurry

980
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,240
It's not good

981
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,360
Something big has happened

982
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,320
What happened

983
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,200
Coal nuclear his sister was caught by the PLA

984
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,000
What

985
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
Report that the platoon leader is all here according to the list

986
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:57,880
Departure

987
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes

988
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,800
Parking

989
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,440
Stop, stop

990
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,840
Sister sister

991
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,600
What do you guys do

992
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,040
Why did you arrest my sister

993
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,320
Comrade, we are on official duty

994
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,120
Please get out of the way at once

995
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,880
Don't let people go, do you

996
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,520
Sister coal core

997
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,200
No

998
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,480
Sister coal core

999
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,720
Who is it

1000
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,240
Coming, coming

1001
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,480
Who is it

1002
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,080
Why are you here

1003
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
What happened

1004
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,560
What happened

1005
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,240
Something big has happened

1006
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,200
Tonight, the whole city closed down brothels and arrested prostitutes

1007
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,760
Do you know

1008
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,560
I know

1009
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
The district has issued a notice

1010
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,280
You keep your voice down

1011
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,280
I'll keep my voice down

1012
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Just your Tian Zao

1013
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,400
With a bunch of children

1014
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,240
Stop military vehicles

1015
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,480
How is that possible

1016
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,320
It can't be

1017
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,280
She has been arrested by the PLA now

1018
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,080
Chunxi Sister Chunxi Sister Chunxi Sister

1019
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:30,640
Sister Chunxi Sister Chunxi Sister

1020
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:31,920
Chief

1021
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,480
Sister Chunxi, she is indeed a prostitute

1022
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
But she did it for her sick mother

1023
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,920
I had to sell myself to a brothel

1024
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,960
There is also a younger brother named Coal Core

1025
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,800
Coal core and her and me

1026
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,120
We're all orphans, we're all born in hardship

1027
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,800
If you take her away,

1028
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,240
He has no father or mother

1029
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,760
She is the only sister

1030
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
You took her away

1031
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,400
What do you do with her bad karma brother

1032
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,360
This little comrade

1033
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
We shut down brothels

1034
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,840
Is to put these suffering sisters

1035
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,960
Save from the fire pit

1036
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,520
We're not arresting them

1037
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
Is to gather them together

1038
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,880
Let them receive education and focus on transformation

1039
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,160
So that they can start a new life

1040
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,200
Participate in the construction of the motherland in the future

1041
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,640
Become the Master of New China

1042
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,480
Education

1043
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,720
Transformation

1044
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,680
No

1045
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,560
Chief, I can't understand what you said

1046
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,840
It's not how to report it

1047
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,480
Come in

1048
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,560
Head of report

1049
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,800
Speak

1050
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Comrades in the sub-bureaus and street governments outside the door

1051
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,520
To bail this little girl out

1052
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,040
Got it

1053
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,880
Little comrade

1054
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,760
Think over what I said

1055
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,520
Jujube

1056
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,560
You are really capable

1057
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Dare to intercept military vehicles

1058
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,720
Do you know what this is

1059
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,120
Bandits and bullies

1060
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,440
What's wrong with me saving my sister

1061
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,640
You're right, I'm wrong

1062
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,560
I should never have let Red Tassel reuse you

1063
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,480
I shouldn't have bailed you tonight

1064
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,040
I'll keep you honest after a few days

1065
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,280
Close and close

1066
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,520
I'll go back in a big deal

1067
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,400
Elder sister

1068
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,080
Lao Lin, don't say a few words

1069
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,760
Red tassel

1070
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,760
Such a person

1071
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,600
And you used her as a street activist

1072
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,480
Did I tell you

1073
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,560
She's a bomb

1074
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,520
Blow it up now

1075
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,520
Red tassel, let me tell you something

1076
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,560
Although the troops released her this time,

1077
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,160
But this incident has caused

1078
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,680
Extremely bad influence

1079
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,760
If Beijing citizens are individuals, stop military vehicles

1080
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,800
What kind of system is that

1081
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,160
This matter

1082
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,240
Your street government must deal with it seriously

1083
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,840
Or you and I can't help it

1084
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,680
Explain to the superior leader

1085
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,320
Do you know

1086
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Elder sister

1087
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,600
What I heard him say is that

1088
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
I got you into trouble

1089
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,640
Let's talk about it back. Go

1090
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,760
Are you okay? Go
