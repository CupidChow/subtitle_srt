1
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,360
You can't figure it out

2
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,720
Don't mention it

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,040
Just go and have a look

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
Those residents of your segment

5
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,480
Their lives are not improving

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,840
In the hands of ordinary people

7
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
Are you getting rich slowly

8
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,280
Look at how many houses have televisions now

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,080
Washing machine refrigerator tape recorder

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,200
Those idle unemployed youths in society

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
Do you earn money by individuals

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,120
There are fewer troubles

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
You go and have a look again

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,640
There are now ten thousand yuan households in the society

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,200
What did ordinary people call these people before

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,280
Banye profiteer

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
Now

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
I will also use discriminatory eyes

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,360
What do you think of these self-employed workers

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
Won't

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,120
This is the social

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,880
What

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Progress

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,880
Don't worry. I can't figure it out. I'll follow suit

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,680
You can't go wrong

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,480
Think slowly

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
Again, the same sentence

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,080
Our party is a party that serves the people

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
Let the people live a good life

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,120
Is the last word

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,640
Come and give it to me

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
How's it going, Dad

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,960
This colored one

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
Is it much better than the black and white one

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
That's true

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,200
It's gorgeous

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
It doesn't hurt to look at your eyes, dad

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,160
Let me have a look

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
It's not you. Why are you sour?

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm telling you

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,840
Just this thing

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
How many years do you save your salary

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,520
You may not be able to afford it all

44
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,440
Do you know

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,520
I can't afford it. I don't buy it. I don't watch it

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,960
Do you like to watch or not

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,480
You have you

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,880
You may not watch TV

49
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
You don't want this, do you

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Walkman

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
It's for me

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
Nonsense

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
This

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,480
I just need this thing

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,360
I just point to it and "learn from me"

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm telling you

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,720
Thank you, brother

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
I know you like this thing

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,200
Not a day or two

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm going back to Guangzhou to buy goods

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
I bought it specially for you

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,240
Sure

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,440
I still have my brother in my heart

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,720
You will be in front of your parents in the future

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,880
Just say less bad things about me, you know

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Where do I have it

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,280
All I said was words of concern

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,880
No, mom

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Dong Zi

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,160
The government decided to be in Xidan

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Where do you set up your stall to develop the night market

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Find Aunt Jujube quickly

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Go to the neighborhood Committee and issue a certificate

74
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,440
Go to the industrial and commercial office and get the individual business license

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Really, that's great

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,480
I'll do it tomorrow

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,640
Mom, I'm telling you

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,040
With this business license,

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,760
Your son, I wouldn't be a guerrilla

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,880
I am an open regular army

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
Is it Dad

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,160
The government gives you individual traders

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,440
Get a business license

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll also divide you into regions for business

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,200
Is to bring you stragglers

86
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Organize

87
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
You used to be self-employed

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,800
Your father and I don't agree

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
But we can't control you either

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,640
Now it is the state that vigorously develops self-employment

91
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Your father and I can't be stumbling blocks either

92
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
So you have to remember

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,720
You are the son of Lin Zheng and Li Hongying

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,400
You should take the lead in the night market

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,400
To operate properly

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Don't cheat customers into making money

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Mom, you can rest assured

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,600
Xiaomin

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
Go to school

100
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,760
Let's go

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
How's your study lately

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Can you keep up with your lessons

103
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,920
Not bad

104
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,320
What do you want? Don't mention it

105
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,440
You come to me and I'll help you

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Got it

107
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Are you a little annoying to me

108
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
No

109
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Then I'll tell you so much

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,200
You sent me away in just two or three words

111
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
Is it what I told you

112
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,480
You're not very interested

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,560
Xiaomin

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,240
Why don't I tell you something you're interested in

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,880
Today, my mother came back and told Dongzi

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,760
Said that the state now strongly supports it

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,440
This individual economy

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,240
Said Dong Zi, the stall in front of their Xidan clothing building

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Has been officially designated as a business area

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
Run a Xidan night market

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
Do you mean it

122
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
Well, if that's the case

123
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
Wei Dong

124
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
There will be a formal career in the future

125
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,920
You don't have to be chased by the defense team anymore

126
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,080
That's for sure

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
And now the country

128
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,280
To give these self-employed people

129
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Get a formal individual business license

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
My mother asked him to find the jujube aunt

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Go to the neighborhood Committee to issue a certificate

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,480
Go to that industrial and commercial office for a photo

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
This policy of the state is good

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Give a business license to the self-employed

135
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,520
It's equivalent to being

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
To unemployed youth like Weidong

137
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,000
Gave them a way out

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,840
In this way, people in the society in the future

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,440
Never look down on them again

140
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
Yeah

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,320
Now these self-employed people

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Make a lot of money

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,480
There are also many thousands of households

144
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Xiaomin Wanyuan Household

145
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
Nowadays, many ordinary people in the society

146
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
I've never seen so much money

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
I didn't look down on these people

148
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,520
Now it's time to envy and envy and envy

149
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
The country's policy of reform and opening up is really good

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,200
Transformation from planned economy to market economy

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,360
Is actually

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Happened around our ordinary people

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,840
I found you talking about this

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
This country's policies are still set after set

155
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
Do you understand it thoroughly

156
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Of course

157
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
Our evening politics teacher

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Emphasized

159
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,320
The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee

160
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,600
And the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
This is the trend of the country's future development

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
Of course I have to take it seriously

163
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Xiaomin

164
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
I have to pick your gift.

165
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,760
You see what you are interested in.

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,920
You can talk quite well

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,720
Especially those related to Dong Zi

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,400
You are more energetic

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Here we go again

170
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Jujube aunt

171
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
Jujube aunt

172
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,240
Jujube aunt

173
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,640
Uncle

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,640
Xiaomin

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,120
Xiaomin

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
Dong Zi didn't eat it, did he

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Sit down and have a bite

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
Not me. I ate

179
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
After eating, you two eat slowly

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,920
What's the matter? This is

181
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
You're mad at me

182
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,800
How did you recruit our girl again

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,840
Come on, aunt, don't ask

184
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
It's all my fault anyway

185
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,479
My wrong uncle

186
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,240
That's enough

187
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,520
Let the children take care of themselves

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,080
Don't get involved in it

189
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
It's not what I said.

190
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
I got involved

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,039
Don't I just ask

192
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,159
Get get

193
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,760
You ask, you ask

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,280
You asked me to ask, so I asked

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm not asking

196
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
I don't care yet

197
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,600
Don't, aunt

198
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm telling you that you really have to take care of my business

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
My mother specially asked me to find it

200
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
You are the director of the neighborhood Committee

201
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,040
Give a proof

202
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
Then I can hurry to the industrial and commercial office

203
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
Get the business license of the night market

204
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,440
That's why you came here early in the morning

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,880
Aunt

206
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,200
You said that the business license of Xidan Night Market

207
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,640
It's a great event for my Juanzi

208
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,640
You have to take care of this and this

209
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,320
Aunt

210
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
I didn't say no

211
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Can I leave it alone

212
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
Red Tassel has already told me

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,320
After dinner

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
Let's go to the neighborhood Committee after dinner

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,160
I'll give you a certificate

216
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,240
Good aunt

217
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,400
Dong Zi, haven't you eaten

218
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,560
Isn't this a steamed stuffed bun

219
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll get you another pair of chopsticks

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
No, no, no, aunt

221
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,120
Just other people's meals are fragrant

222
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
These fried dough sticks look good

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm telling you, uncle

224
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
I love this fried dough sticks soaked soybean milk best

225
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,080
It's delicious

226
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,400
Just say you love our food best

227
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:02,960
Is

228
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
Listen to me, all three of you

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,480
There is an individual business license here

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
Is to have a serious business

231
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
This is also the country

232
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Care for your unemployed youth

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,120
Be thankful

234
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Cherish

235
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
In addition, with the individual business license,

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
Practice stalls in the future

237
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
It's not yourselves

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
There are also countries

239
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,680
Therefore, in the process of practicing stalls in the future,

240
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,640
Be sure to talk about honesty

241
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,840
What's the old saying

242
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,680
To be genuine, childlike and innocent

243
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,040
You can't kidnap customers

244
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,480
Jujube aunt, you are so old

245
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
Why do you tell my parents the same thing?

246
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,840
This is how the old family treats you children

247
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,520
Don't feel at ease

248
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,520
Tell me a few more words. What's the matter

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,320
No way

250
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,480
Cheng Te has become

251
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Don't worry, aunt jujube

252
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
About the abduction

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
I, Lin Weidong, can never do it

254
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,720
Yes, aunt jujube

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,400
The three of us are not like that

256
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,560
In the future, I will definitely give you a long face

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,800
Jujube aunt

258
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,800
Simply

259
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's write you a guarantee

260
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,640
Do you have any paper

261
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
Go to the side, go to you

262
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,200
You wrote a bloody book. I don't believe you

263
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Don't write

264
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,200
Go what you should do

265
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,240
Here you go

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,200
Quick

267
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Come one, two, three

268
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,120
Thank you, Aunt Jujube

269
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go. Let's go

270
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
Show me don't rob

271
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,880
Don't rob me of it

272
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,440
Don't rob

273
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,360
Let me see

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Don't do it. Don't break it

275
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,560
Let me tell you something

276
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
We are also people with photos

277
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,640
Is no longer a small profiteer

278
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,120
We're serious

279
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Individual industrial and commercial operators have become

280
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,640
Dong Zi, let's find a place quickly

281
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,680
Frame it with a glass frame

282
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
We'll put it on our booth later

283
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
Let him dare to underestimate us

284
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,040
Set up a night market

285
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,880
Then it will be broken and lost later

286
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,920
I think it's safest to leave it at home

287
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,200
Otherwise, you two are dirt

288
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm telling you

289
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
We have to operate this night market with a license

290
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
Even if you don't frame it in a frame

291
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
We have to take it with us every day

292
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,520
In case someone from the industrial and commercial office checks it out,

293
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,400
And then spread us out and collect us

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
That's what you have to take with you

295
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
Lai Juanzi

296
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,840
This baby will be handed over to you for safekeeping in the future

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,360
Keep an eye on it. Do you listen

298
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Don't worry

299
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,800
Go

300
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,400
Go

301
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,400
Keep an eye on it

302
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,560
Keep an eye on it

303
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,720
I know my future is not a dream

304
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,080
The latest banana shirt

305
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,480
The latest watch to the store

306
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't miss passing by

307
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
The latest banana shirt

308
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
The color of the latest model

309
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,680
Let's take a look at the electronic watch

310
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,200
Take a walk and have a look

311
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Take a walk and have a look

312
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,480
Take a walk and have a look

313
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,800
Take a look and have a look

314
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Pat your forehead and do the math

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,040
There is no such shop after this village

316
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,520
There is no such thing except this bag

317
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
Take a walk and have a look

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Electronic watch, electronic watch

319
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,240
Take a walk and have a look at the banana shirt

320
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
The latest banana shirt

321
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,400
The latest banana shirt

322
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Would you look at the banana shirt banana shirt

323
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,840
Grandpa, have a look at the banana shirt

324
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
Oh, oh, oh, thank you, thank you

325
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Big Brother Big Brother

326
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,600
The latest electronic watch banana shirt

327
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,400
Juanzi holds it, holds it

328
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,560
Take a look and have a look

329
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
Why did you go

330
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,640
I have no idea

331
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Don't miss it when you pass by

332
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Look at it

333
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,000
The latest banana shirt

334
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,560
Right

335
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
Right

336
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,560
Okay, okay, okay

337
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,480
Dong Zi

338
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,040
Why did you suddenly run away when you were selling goods just now

339
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
Who did you see

340
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,200
I think I saw Xiaomin

341
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,000
It is impossible

342
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
How long has Xiaomin ignored you

343
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,320
She can come to the night market to see you

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
What about dreams

345
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm telling you it must be her

346
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,680
Love one's own feelings

347
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
What do you mean, love yourself

348
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm telling you

349
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,120
Don't look at us at odds now

350
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
No one cares about anyone

351
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,120
But our hearts are all together

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
It's sour to death

353
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
You just dream, you

354
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
I was dreaming

355
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm dreaming that I make a lot of money

356
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,680
Marry our Xiaomin

357
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,760
You come to me

358
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,040
With a smile

359
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,680
Brought my troubles

360
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,480
I already have her in my heart

361
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
She got there before you

362
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,880
We arrived together

363
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,440
This hadron

364
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,520
What's the matter with you

365
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,120
How come someone beat me up

366
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,320
Ask my brother

367
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,280
What happened to Gangzi

368
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,280
Your brother, he is a stuffy gourd

369
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,320
What can he say

370
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,320
You tell mom

371
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
What the hell happened

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
I fry the oil used in enema for customers

373
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,960
I told him to let him fall down

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,160
He turned out well

375
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,240
Mixed the remaining oil with the new one

376
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,400
Haven't told me yet

377
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,880
I just use the oil mixed together

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,320
I fried an enema for the customer

379
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,360
After the guest ate it,

380
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Said there was a halo smell

381
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,200
You have to ask me for a refund

382
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,480
I get anxious as soon as I hear it

383
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,640
I said no way

384
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,640
As a result, there was a quarrel

385
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Then the guest found out the barrel of oil

386
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
There is waste oil, not new oil

387
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Wave and give me a punch

388
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,360
Not only that

389
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,360
And sued me to the industrial and commercial office

390
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,080
The industrial and commercial office collected my stall

391
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
And called me to the industrial and commercial office

392
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Criticism and education all night

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
Gangzi

394
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,880
That used oil has to pour out

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
It can no longer be used by guests

396
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,240
How did you do it? You

397
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,560
Isn't it a waste

398
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,400
Grandpa, do you know

399
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,480
That's in rural Shaanxi

400
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Every household still eats water and cooks vegetables

401
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,159
You can't see the oil star at all

402
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,839
So a lot of oil

403
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,999
Then it will fall down

404
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,640
I can't bear it

405
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,880
Gangzi, this is Beijing

406
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,479
This is different from your rural Shaanxi

407
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,719
Mom, I've been holding on to this for a long time

408
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,199
I really can't hold back today

409
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,120
Mom, listen to it

410
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,040
My brother is an elm head

411
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,400
An entire peasant

412
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,280
What business do you have to let me do with him

413
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
What is the result

414
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:33,959
The result is that

415
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,680
The result of being beaten up by others

416
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,760
Dihadron

417
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
Don't play this game with me, three young sons

418
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Love with or without

419
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,320
Unwilling to take it down

420
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
I just don't want to work with you

421
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
To ruin things like this

422
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,360
Back to the house

423
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Gangzi

424
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,400
It's not an attitude. Look at it

425
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,360
You said his temper is whoever you want.

426
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
What's going on here? This

427
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,640
The child

428
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Defender

429
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,720
Come with me

430
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,680
Defender

431
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,200
What's wrong with you these days

432
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,200
Nothing happened

433
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,480
Not much

434
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
Go to work all day and lose your mind

435
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,760
I don't even know what you're thinking

436
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
There is such a backlog of manuscripts

437
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
The author gives it to me every day

438
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
Call to ask about the manuscript

439
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,520
How do you want me to reply

440
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,720
Editor-in-chief, I really didn't mean to press the manuscript

441
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,720
What about my time

442
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
I've been thinking about a problem

443
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,000
Think about a problem

444
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
You don't read the manuscript well

445
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,680
What are you thinking about

446
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm thinking about my way out in the future

447
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Outlet

448
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,920
Row

449
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,120
Defender

450
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
You have been in our magazine for many years

451
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,000
I am a leader

452
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
I may not care enough about you

453
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,480
Since you said you had an idea,

454
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Today

455
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll just listen to you and talk about it

456
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
What on earth do you think

457
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
Look at it

458
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,080
Now the country is talking about reform and opening up

459
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Invigorate the economy

460
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,200
What about the common people

461
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,880
This value is also constantly changing

462
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,560
So the importance of this money

463
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,800
It's getting more and more prominent

464
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,760
Right

465
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,640
Defender

466
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,520
I understand what you said

467
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,160
But we are a public institution

468
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,280
Our task is to publish better novels

469
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
And reportage

470
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,520
For the general public

471
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
Provide high-quality spiritual food

472
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Editor-in-chief, you say so

473
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,640
I have to make some suggestions

474
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,400
Isn't he a common man in our editorial department

475
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,640
You have to get paid differently

476
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,240
Do you have to eat and live

477
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Now the state's annual financial allocation

478
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,200
That's all

479
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
The income of our editorial staff

480
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,640
Can you compare with those self-employed people

481
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
It's far from it. It's far from it

482
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,360
Isn't the country saying now

483
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
We should vigorously advocate enterprises and institutions

484
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,400
Self-management

485
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
Try not to trouble the country

486
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,720
Isn't it

487
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,840
That's right

488
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Isn't our editorial department also engaged in tertiary production

489
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,480
This is the question I want to talk to you about

490
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Just our tertiary production

491
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,360
Is there anyone who knows how to operate

492
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
Make a mess

493
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
Don't talk about making money

494
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Can you not pay for it

495
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm lucky

496
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
What do you mean

497
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,040
Editor-in-Chief

498
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
I want to contract the third production of the editorial department

499
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,480
You can rest assured

500
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,560
As long as you give it to me

501
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
I, Lin Weimin, promise

502
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
I will definitely put our tertiary products

503
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,000
Make it prosperous

504
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,720
Not only improve economic benefits

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,560
It can also make our editorial staff

506
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,760
Multiple bonus

507
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,280
You believe me

508
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,560
Xiaomin

509
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
Brother Wei Min

510
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
I will graduate from college in one year

511
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah time flies too fast

512
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,920
You haven't forgotten what you promised me, have you

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,840
What is it

514
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,840
About entering the editorial department

515
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,960
Xiaomin

516
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,400
I came to pick you up today

517
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,640
There's so much I want to talk to you about

518
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
You go ahead

519
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,440
I think as far as the current situation is concerned

520
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
You graduated from night school and went to the editorial department as an editor

521
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
Is not the best choice

522
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
Why do you have this idea

523
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,640
The reason why I have this idea

524
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
It's because of Wei Dong, a smelly boy

525
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,120
What gives me excitement

526
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,360
Stimulus

527
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Yeah

528
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Do you know

529
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,920
Dong Zi is in Xidan Night Market

530
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
Money earned in one night

531
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,080
It can be worth me for several months

532
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,880
And me

533
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,320
I have been in the editorial department for several years

534
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,560
Every day is to read the manuscript and give advice

535
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
Read the manuscript and give advice

536
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,760
Over and over

537
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,800
All I do is make wedding dresses for others

538
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,160
Then where is the value of my life

539
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,120
At least so am I.

540
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,040
Highly talented students who graduated from the Literature Department of the National People's Congress

541
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,280
Mixed up until now

542
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,280
Even a novel

543
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,920
Not even a reportage has been published

544
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
Man Dong Zi earns money in one night

545
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,320
The fraction is more than I earn in one day

546
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,680
Xiaomin

547
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
Say something from the heart

548
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm so confused, really

549
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,040
How should I go in the future of Lin Weimin

550
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I should think about

551
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Then how do you think

552
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,440
I have officially today

553
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,280
It was put forward to our editor-in-chief

554
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I want to go to sea to do business

555
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,200
Contract the tertiary production of our editorial department

556
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,880
Brother Weimin, you are going to do business

557
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,400
What about my business

558
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,200
Excuse me, Xiaomin

559
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
There is a situation

560
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
I've been afraid to tell you

561
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,560
You go ahead

562
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,360
Now our magazine is hiring people

563
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,800
The threshold is getting higher and higher

564
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,000
There are a lot of graduates from Tsinghua Peking University

565
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,360
Everyone wants to enter our editorial department

566
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
Like you

567
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Junior college students who graduated from evening school

568
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,760
It is estimated that entering our editorial department is

569
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,240
There is no hope

570
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,760
Xiaomin

571
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,480
I'm sorry

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm really sorry

573
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,560
Now this society is changing with each passing day

574
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
It's developing too fast

575
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,720
Become like this. This situation

576
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,320
It's something I didn't expect

577
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,480
Where's your watch

578
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,240
Where's the application

579
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,600
Put the application

580
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,640
What about your application? That young man

581
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,840
I've got all the applications

582
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,480
Everybody stand up. Stand up

583
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,640
Take all the applications

584
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,480
Don't worry

585
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,480
Line up. Line up.

586
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
Stand up. Stand up

587
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,760
Don't squeeze, don't squeeze, don't squeeze

588
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
Listen to me first

589
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Now I want to apply for this individual business license

590
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,080
There are more and more young people

591
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,120
Now the state has regulations

592
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,920
The first is that life at home is really difficult

593
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,280
Right

594
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,280
Second, there are overseas relations

595
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
Third, there is really no regular job

596
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,000
Unemployed youth

597
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,200
Give priority to handling

598
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,560
Today, you all put everyone's application

599
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,720
Put it here first

600
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
After that, according to your application, we

601
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,520
Go door to door to find out the situation

602
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,920
The conditions are true and meet the conditions

603
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,000
Our neighborhood Committee will give you a certificate

604
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,600
After that, take our certificate

605
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,960
Go to the industrial and commercial office to apply for an individual business license

606
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,960
Is that clear

607
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Isn't it too long

608
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Jujube aunt

609
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,640
Our gang

610
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
That's what you grew up watching

611
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,120
Then you know the situation of every household

612
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,720
Do you still need to go door to door

613
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Need it

614
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,320
I said aunt jujube

615
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
You are not too tired

616
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
Aunt Jujube is not too tired

617
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,280
Do it or not do it or not

618
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
That's my job

619
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,840
Do you know

620
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,600
Application

621
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Put the application here quickly today

622
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
Put it here, put it here, put it here

623
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,280
Don't mess up

624
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,120
One by one, one by one

625
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Don't worry, come and come

626
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't care if I lose it

627
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,600
You this

628
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,520
Put it here, put it here, put it here

629
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,120
Xiaomin

630
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,600
Have you eaten

631
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Mom and Dad are busy

632
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,360
Haven't thought about what to eat yet

633
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,840
Go, I'll treat you

634
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Go

635
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,760
Braised beef in a pot

636
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,040
Spicy Siniperca chuatsi

637
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,120
Mixed iron plate

638
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,000
Crab and potato salad

639
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,160
And one red vegetable soup for each person

640
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,240
By the way, another pickle

641
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,040
Thank you

642
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,560
Juanzi

643
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,320
You don't even take a recipe to order here

644
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,560
This is the place

645
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
We come here every three or five times

646
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
I memorized all the recipes

647
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,200
This place is quite expensive

648
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,520
Sprinkle water

649
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,600
What do you mean

650
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,240
It's just a little thing

651
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,360
That's all the money

652
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,880
Sell some batmobile shirts and jeans

653
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,880
I earned it back

654
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,320
Xiaomin, you are dressed too dirt

655
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,080
What age is this

656
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,680
In this way

657
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
You come to our stand at night

658
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,200
Sister, find you some of the most fashionable ones

659
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,120
It's time for you to dress up, too

660
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,000
I think it's good for me to do this

661
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,520
Your trendy stuff

662
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,520
I can't get used to it

663
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Actually

664
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,160
I've been trying to talk to you about something for days

665
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
I'm finally free today

666
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,680
What are you looking for me for

667
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
What to do

668
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
About the happiness of your whole life

669
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Come on, you

670
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,200
Alarmist again

671
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,320
What I said is true

672
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,280
Do you know

673
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,760
Dong Zi is now a big hot spot

674
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,680
People are handsome and rich

675
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,600
Our sisters at the night market

676
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,520
Follow him like a fly all day

677
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,000
And those beautiful girls who go shopping

678
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,320
Then look

679
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,760
That look at him

680
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,320
All shine

681
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,840
I've been looking at several

682
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
In the name of shopping every three or five times

683
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,120
Come to our stall and get tired of Dong Zi

684
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,440
That's just a living flutter

685
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
What does it have to do with me to pounce on him

686
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,360
It's a good thing someone likes him

687
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,600
Sister

688
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,160
Aren't you afraid that Dong Zi will change his mind

689
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,080
Fancy other girls

690
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,840
Juanzi

691
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,840
Lin Weidong and I

692
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,240
It doesn't matter anymore

693
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,640
He's him I'm me

694
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
We go our separate ways

695
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Come on

696
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,600
Don't others know that I don't know yet

697
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,520
You and Dong Zi have been in the past year

698
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,080
On the surface, although no one cares about anyone,

699
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm just asking you

700
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,520
Do you always have a few days every month

701
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,520
I want to go to the night market and secretly see Dong Zi

702
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,600
Don't you dare say you didn't

703
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
I don't have your nonsense

704
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
I saw it all

705
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Don't like to expose you.

706
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,880
And

707
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
Do you do it every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night

708
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,560
Everyone has to go to class at night

709
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah

710
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
This is over

711
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,000
Dong Zi every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night

712
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,440
Will leave early

713
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,560
Ask him why he is going, and he won't say

714
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,920
Then I and Huozi know it in my heart

715
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,200
I went to see you at the night gate

716
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,960
Thank you

717
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
Come to Xiaomin, try it

718
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,360
Red vegetable soup

719
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,520
Thief's Stick

720
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,480
Delicious

721
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,240
Xiaomin

722
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
You try this pickle again

723
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,840
I order every time I come

724
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,800
Thank you

725
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,520
Thank you

726
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,240
Xiaomin

727
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,920
You and Dong Zi can't live without each other

728
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,200
Almost got it

729
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
Fortunately, the girl who pounces on Dongzi now

730
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,440
Nothing too good

731
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
This Dong Zi won't be tempted either

732
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,040
But I want to remind you

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This man can change

734
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,120
You and Dong Zi are almost at odds

735
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
Don't be stiff any more

736
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Grab a chance

737
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,680
Find a step

738
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
Just go down the slope and donkey

739
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,600
Juanzi

740
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't you like Dong Zi, too

741
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,840
Why are you telling me this

742
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,760
I do like Dong Zi

743
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,280
But since then,

744
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,240
Dong Zi, in front of all of us

745
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,280
Said he didn't marry you in his life

746
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,600
I knew it was impossible for me and him

747
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,080
But we are young.

748
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,960
There is an old saying that goes well

749
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,600
This fertilizer and water don't flow to other people's fields

750
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
It doesn't matter if Dong Zi is not good to me

751
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,840
But if he is good with others besides you,

752
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,400
I was the first to say no

753
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,520
Come on, you

754
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,880
Eat

755
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,720
Your pickles

756
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,720
Thank you

757
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,200
Gap

758
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,400
Hang up this, this

759
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
You hang this

760
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,600
This style is selling well today

761
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,840
Dong Zi

762
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,440
You know it's noon today

763
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Did I have dinner with anyone

764
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,040
Eat with whom you love

765
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm serious with you

766
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,640
Dong Ge

767
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
Xiaoli, why are you here

768
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,520
Every time you go to Guangzhou to find me to load the goods

769
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,120
Can't I come to Beijing to see you

770
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Yes, yes, too much

771
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,280
You called me last time and asked me to stock up for you

772
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
What about after this is ready

773
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,680
I just want to come to Beijing to see you

774
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,320
What's the situation here

775
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,640
So I flew over without waiting for you

776
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,400
Yes, I checked the goods for you by train

777
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,800
It will arrive in two days

778
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,240
Thank you

779
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Thank you

780
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,440
This is really unexpected

781
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,240
You said you were so busy

782
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,720
I also came to Beijing to see me

783
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,720
It really is

784
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,080
Thank you again

785
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Don't I miss you

786
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,760
I've just never been to Beijing

787
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520
I always wanted to come to the capital to open my eyes

788
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,520
Long insight

789
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,800
Brother Dong, we have a deal

790
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
I'm here this time. I'll stay for a few days

791
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,680
You have to take me with you

792
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,240
Have a good tour of the capital

793
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
No problem

794
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,600
Tiananmen Square

795
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,160
Palace Museum Great Wall Summer Palace

796
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,240
Temple of Heaven Beihai Jingshan Park

797
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll show you around

798
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,800
And then I have to take you to eat

799
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,440
This authentic Beijing roast duck

800
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,400
Beijing instant-boiled mutton

801
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
Braised sausage

802
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
I'll take you all to eat

803
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
If we had time

804
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll take you to Tianjin again

805
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Try the seafood in Tianjin

806
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,960
No worse than your Guangzhou

807
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
How energetic

808
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
You just got off the plane and haven't eaten yet, have you

809
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,000
Just

810
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,560
Opposite Hongbin Building

811
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,360
I'll treat you to this authentic braised oxtail

812
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,440
Braised prawns with coriander fried powder and Dan oil

813
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,960
Then go, wait for what to go

814
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go

815
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,200
Look at the stall

816
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,760
It's not that you don't take us

817
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,360
We haven't eaten either

818
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,520
Now our booth is now

819
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,360
Who is this woman

820
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,400
East children and friends

821
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,960
Yeah, it's too fashionable

822
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,679
It's beautiful

823
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,160
What's beautiful? How coquettish

824
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Don't talk nonsense

825
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,399
Dong Zi doesn't like women like that

826
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,000
Juanzi

827
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,279
Don't say so absolutely

828
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,080
You didn't see Dong Zi's little eyes just now

829
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,440
They've all been robbed

830
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,960
I think it's your eyes that have lost the thief

831
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,838
The saliva is almost falling to the ground

832
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,480
True acid

833
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,880
Let's go

834
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,080
Conscience of heaven and earth

835
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,680
Juanzi

836
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,359
Have you heard this poem

837
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,120
Once the sea was difficult for water

838
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,600
Except Wushan is not a cloud

839
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,000
Juanzi

840
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,440
In my heart

841
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,520
You're the only one

842
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,960
Also turned to the text

843
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:57,720
That is, you despise me

844
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,920
Our ancestors were all intellectuals

845
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,640
Officials

846
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,120
My father

847
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,960
It is also a cultural bureau

848
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,800
An expert in writing and drawing

849
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,160
So in my stomach, except for grass,

850
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
There is also a little ink

851
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,920
Get get

852
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,080
You just blow it. You

853
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,720
Not you

854
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,200
You just

855
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
Just look me in the eye

856
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,760
Hang up, hang up

857
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,440
Do you know why this Shichahai is called Shichahai

858
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,200
Let me tell you something

859
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,200
Shichahai is divided into Qianhai Houhai and Xihai

860
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,040
You know, right

861
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,640
The most important thing is

862
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,600
This is where Galeries Lafayette often comes

863
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,160
Galeries Lafayette right right right

864
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,920
And you know, it freezes in winter

865
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,840
We swim here in summer

866
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,280
Old Beijing fried enema

867
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,120
Here you are. Thank you. You're welcome

868
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,800
Don't worry. I'll tell you this thing

869
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,080
How to eat in old Beijing

870
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,560
You have to dip in this garlic juice

871
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Boss, you have too little garlic juice

872
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
I'm here. I'm here

873
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,640
Dip in garlic juice

874
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,920
Big mouths must be big mouths

875
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,760
Take a bite and go up

876
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
It's crisp enough. Yeah

877
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,960
Xiaomin

878
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
What's the matter

879
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,240
Something happened

880
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,680
Something big has happened

881
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,080
What happened again

882
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,800
I can't

883
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,080
I've put up with this for days

884
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,160
Not today

885
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,360
I have to tell you

886
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,080
You go ahead and say it

887
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,200
Dong Zi and a woman named Xiaoli

888
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
The girl named Xiaoli

889
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,040
What kind of person is he

890
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,480
Xiaomin put it this way

891
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,120
This Xiaoli can't be said to be prettier than you

892
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,000
But definitely more feminine than you

893
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,720
Is that all men

894
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
The kind of woman everyone dreams of

895
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,120
My silly sisters

896
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
It's been five days

897
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,400
Lin Weidong, a smelly boy, didn't do anything

898
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,800
I don't even practice at the stall

899
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,920
Surround this woman all day around Beijing

900
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,840
Play, eat and stroll

901
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,080
I've never seen it before

902
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Which woman has he ever been so attentive to

903
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,960
I thought you said

904
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,320
Is Xiaoli your last home

905
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Your wide range of goods

906
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,680
Don't they all come in from her

907
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
Then Lin Weidong should be attentive to his clients

908
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,840
There is nothing wrong with it

909
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,960
Not the same

910
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,560
Absolutely different

911
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,400
This woman likes Dongzi 100%

912
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,120
Why else would she come all the way to Beijing

913
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,920
So many customers in Beijing

914
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,160
Why is she looking for Lin Weidong

915
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,080
You don't even know how close they are

916
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,120
I'll learn from you

917
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,320
That's it

918
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
With one's arm slung over one's arm

919
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,480
Parade through the city

920
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,200
Now the whole night market buddies and sisters think

921
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,600
This woman is Lin Weidong's girlfriend

922
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,760
Am I telling you the truth

923
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,280
If it weren't for you

924
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,000
I hope they both make it

925
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
That's really a talented woman

926
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Xiaoli is a woman

927
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,720
And beautiful

928
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,160
And feminine

929
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,520
Good personality

930
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,920
And money

931
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,200
I like her as much as I do.

932
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,480
Not to mention those smelly men

933
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,520
Sister, if you don't think of a way about this

934
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,200
Lin Weidong really became someone else's

935
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,360
Dong Ge

936
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,360
Do you know

937
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,640
These days are really the time in my life

938
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
The happiest day

939
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,120
Just be happy

940
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,360
Happiness is the most important thing

941
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,520
Happy. Of course I'm happy

942
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,680
Is so handsome

943
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,360
The man I like is with me again

944
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,880
What am I unhappy about

945
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Dong Ge

946
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,040
When I first saw you in Guangzhou,

947
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,440
I like you

948
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Do you know

949
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,480
Actually, there are quite a few people chasing me

950
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,800
Like a Hong Kong businessman, he has become a rich man

951
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,760
And handsome young men

952
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,280
But I don't even look up to them

953
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Only in you

954
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,400
There is a special attraction

955
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,560
The smell of a man

956
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,120
Really

957
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,360
Much better than those cream niche

958
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,280
Dong Ge

959
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,840
You are the Takakangjian in my heart

960
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,880
Promise me you'll be with me

961
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
Let me be your Mayumi

962
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,160
Don't don't don't

963
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
Too much to drink

964
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
Dance, dance, dance

965
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
I didn't drink too much, brother

966
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,240
Dance, dance, dance

967
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
To be honest with you

968
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
I've made a lot of money over the years

969
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,080
Right now I'm running Hong Kong status

970
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,640
Why don't you come to Hong Kong with me

971
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,680
Just because we work hard in that world of flowers and flowers

972
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
That's sure to make a career

973
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,400
Xiaoli Xiaoli Xiaoli

974
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,440
Dance, dance, dance

975
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,600
Xiaomin

976
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,520
Brother Wei Min

977
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,640
I want to walk alone today

978
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Why don't you go back first

979
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,600
Don't charge

980
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,800
Don't happen to you as a little girl this night

981
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,720
It won't

982
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,080
Don't you follow me

983
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
I left by myself
