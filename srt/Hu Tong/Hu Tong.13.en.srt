1
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
Since this Shangguan Xiaolong

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
Is responsible for sending telegrams

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
That means the radio station

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,000
It should also be in the courtyard of Beichizi Street

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,800
Right

6
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Beichizi Street

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,440
These dog agents are really good at picking places

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,480
This is called black under the lamp

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,280
So you can arrange the direction finding car immediately

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Monitor in the vicinity of the yard

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,040
Once it is confirmed that there is a radio station in the courtyard,

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
We'll go in and arrest people right away

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,120
Yes

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Sir, it's getting late at this time

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
I have to contact there when I go back

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
Then I'll go first

17
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,560
Take care

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Take care

19
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,120
Third Brother

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,880
The sending time agreed with the above

21
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,720
It's coming soon

22
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Why hasn't the team leader come back yet

23
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
It shouldn't be

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,400
Could there be any delay

25
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,040
Is anything going to happen

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
Crow's Mouth

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
The team leader is a tried and tested elite of the party and state

28
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,760
What can happen

29
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Third brother, it's time

30
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,240
Hair or not

31
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Don't wait

32
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,280
The radio station goes in the courtyard

33
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,680
Go

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
Hands up, hands up

35
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Where's Zheng Qiang

36
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
Want to catch Zheng Qiang

37
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
No way

38
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Search

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,200
Yes

40
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,920
Go

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,640
Search over there

42
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,320
Yes

43
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,600
Li San

44
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Zheng Qiang, code-named Night Wolf, is your immediate superior

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,560
Where did he go

46
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Can you not know

47
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
I really don't know

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,720
I wouldn't tell you if I knew

49
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Your boy's mouth is quite hard

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm telling you

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,160
Zheng Qiang is the leader of your latent group

52
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,960
Is your immediate superior

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,640
You are the number one criminal in our city bureau

54
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,920
In the course of several arrests,

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
Let you get away with it

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,600
No

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,840
Not a fluke, to be exact

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,520
Someone tipped you off

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
I want to know the spy who tipped you off

60
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,080
Who is it

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
Do you think I'll tell you

62
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
Then I'll tell you

63
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,240
There is only a dead end to desperate resistance

64
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Ever since I took orders from Shangfeng,

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,720
From the day when I lurked in Beijing,

66
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm not going to leave alive

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay, you say I'm a spy. I think

68
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
But my sister, she's not a spy

69
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
You are wronged in arresting her

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
How did we wronged her

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
I asked her to go to Bank of Tianjin to withdraw the money

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,720
As for what this money is for

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
What do I do

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,560
She doesn't even know

75
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
She is just an ordinary citizen

76
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,400
We'll look into your sister seriously

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,520
Our Communist Party has a policy

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
Never wronged a good man

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
I won't let go of a bad person

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,120
As for whether your sister is a spy or not,

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
And how to deal with it

82
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,640
It depends on whether you have made meritorious deeds or not

83
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
Sir, I want to make meritorious deeds

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,800
Good

85
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Then let me ask you something

86
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Where's Zheng Qiang

87
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,880
I really don't know that

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
I took the money and went back to the yard

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
He's gone

90
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Said the third

91
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
He went to connect with the on-line connection

92
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,680
Who is he on the line

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Where did you pick up the head

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
The third one doesn't know either

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
Then I don't even know

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,440
Are you sure what you said is true

97
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,200
What I said is true

98
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,960
Then I'll ask you again

99
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
Last time you were from Shichahai

100
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,280
Escape from the yard over there

101
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
Who tipped you off

102
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Really nobody tipped us off

103
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
You talk nonsense

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
No one tipped you off

105
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,960
How could you possibly know

106
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
We're gonna get you

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,880
Like a rabbit

108
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Run along the roof

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
When it was getting dark that day,

110
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Zheng Qiang and I have the third child

111
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
Just getting ready to eat

112
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,080
Zheng Qiang suddenly told us

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
It's exposed. Get out of here

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,760
Then the three of us switched on the radio

115
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
As soon as it gets dark,

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
He ran up the ladder to the roof

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,960
You think about it

118
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,040
What happened that day

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,040
Caused Zheng Qiang to suddenly discover that you were exposed

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,320
Nothing really happened that day

121
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,240
It is impossible

122
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
If nothing unexpected happens

123
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
That's a good Zheng Qiang

124
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
How can you suddenly be alert

125
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,000
Think again

126
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,240
I remember

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,040
Say

128
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,319
The three of us were setting the dishes that day

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,159
There seems to be a shouting of peddlers selling goods outside the window

130
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Zheng Qiang's face changed when he heard the sound

131
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,720
Throw your chopsticks on the table

132
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,400
Just tell us it's exposed

133
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,560
Let's pack up and go quickly

134
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
Peddler

135
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
No matter how cunning the spy is,

136
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
There will also be clues

137
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,400
Lao Lin, think again

138
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
From the beginning of liberation to the present

139
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,280
Is there anyone in your precinct

140
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,680
Have you done anything suspicious

141
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,000
Even the slightest abnormal reaction

142
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,480
According to Comrade Sun Tie

143
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,720
Interrogation of Shangguan Xiaolong's confession

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,400
We can now confirm that

145
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,200
During the arrest in Shichahai,

146
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,960
It was a peddler who tipped off Zheng Qiang

147
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
The enemy is too cunning

148
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Using the cries of peddlers,

149
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
Arranged a secret language to inform Zheng Qiang

150
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,640
Tell him he's exposed

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,400
This way of passing messages

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
It's impossible for us to notice

153
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,600
This peddler must be the online of Zheng Qiang

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Or one of his agents on the line

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,920
Since in the arrest of Beichizi,

156
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Zheng Qiang went to meet his on-line connection

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
And accidentally slipped through the net

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
So if you want to catch Zheng Qiang,

159
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,880
You have to find his online

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,720
If you want to find his online line,

161
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,200
You must catch this peddler who passed the message

162
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,000
Section chief

163
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll go to Comrade Hong Ying and Tian Zao at once

164
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
That day they

165
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
Always around the Zheng Qiang Courtyard

166
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,320
They must have met the peddler

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Go quickly

168
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,920
Yes

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,680
Red Tassel Sister

170
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,840
You told Iron Egg about that just now

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
I thought about it carefully

172
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,760
I really remember

173
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
A few of us were watching that day

174
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
When Zheng Qiang was in that hospital,

175
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,560
There is a peddler in the back street

176
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
Pass through the back wall of the courtyard

177
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,120
Shouting while walking in his mouth

178
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
But you also know that

179
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,440
We have a lot of peddlers in this area

180
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
So I didn't pay attention at that time

181
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
Do you remember that peddler

182
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,720
What does it look like

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360
I just glanced at it

184
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
But I'm sure

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
That peddler is definitely not this one

186
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,320
A frequent peddler

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Does he have any characteristics

188
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,280
One meter seven

189
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,040
And then it grows a little rough

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,320
And then maybe in his fifties

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
I really didn't see the rest clearly

192
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,600
What kind of goods does he sell

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,880
Just shouting something in your mouth

194
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,080
Rouge gouache

195
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Needles, thread, brains and other daily necessities

196
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm asking you now

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,400
In our area

198
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Look for the whole area and sell needles and thread brains

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
In his fifties

200
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
A peddler with a meter seven

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Yes

202
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
Good

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,440
Dapeng has something to do

204
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Chief, you weren't in the bureau just now

205
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Chief Gao sent someone to inform me that

206
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Who has tipped off Zheng Qiang

207
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Go to the office and talk

208
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Good

209
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,200
Peddler

210
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:31,880
Right

211
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,560
I tipped off Zheng Qiang

212
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,440
That's the peddler

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
They have a special secret language

214
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
The peddler shouted out the secret language that day

215
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Zheng Qiang knew he was exposed

216
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,720
This situation

217
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,400
The city bureau has notified the district office

218
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Now Sister Red Tassel is starting all the

219
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,000
Street activists went to find this peddler

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,280
Tian Zao once said that she had seen the peddler

221
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,360
Said he was about one meter seven

222
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
Is a man in his fifties

223
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,720
There are no obvious facial features

224
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
Now all the officers in our police station

225
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,080
They all went out to find this peddler

226
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,080
It's over

227
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,880
It's leaked out again

228
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,040
What's wrong with the chief? This is

229
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,200
Nothing

230
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm going to the city bureau to find Chief Gao and them now

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,200
By the way, chief

232
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
I heard you went to prison

233
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,520
Is to arraign the prisoner

234
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Come on, don't ask

235
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,960
You wait for me here

236
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Before I came back

237
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,320
Don't make a move

238
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,840
Good

239
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
This is the case

240
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,080
Director Lin, I understand what you mean

241
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
I'll inform the city bureau immediately

242
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,640
Order all sub-bureaus to be within the scope of the whole city

243
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
Search the peddler

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Then I'll go back to the branch office and explain the task now

245
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Good

246
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,240
You see the situation is like this

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,480
Received an order from the city bureau

248
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,520
All the police stations under the jurisdiction of our branch office

249
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,440
Collective action

250
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,000
In the whole area

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,080
Search for the peddler who tipped off the spy Zheng Qiang

252
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,480
Yes

253
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,720
When I close my eyes, it's full of peddlers

254
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,640
Yeah

255
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,920
Identify so many peddlers every day

256
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,360
I must recognize that my eyes have been spent

257
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,160
Iron egg, I don't think this is a way

258
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,600
How do you say

259
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,640
Look at that

260
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,560
How many peddlers are there in all of Beijing

261
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
Let's look all over the street like this

262
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,240
Anyway, there will be falls

263
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,920
Besides

264
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,600
If the spy tipped off,

265
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Disguise as a peddler

266
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,280
He is not a peddler in normal life

267
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
Then we are not busy in vain

268
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,880
The method is quite stupid

269
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,560
OK, jujube

270
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,000
Now they are learning to use their brains

271
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,240
But think about it

272
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,480
If even the things we can think of

273
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
Can the superior leaders think of it

274
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,760
I think the reason for doing this

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
First, it is because of looking for a peddler

276
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,040
Is the only clue

277
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Since there is this clue,

278
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,560
We're going to check

279
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,920
What about two and one

280
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Our superiors sent us to find peddlers in the whole city

281
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,040
Maybe there are some other ideas

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,480
But our mission

283
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,040
Is to carry out the orders of superiors

284
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,480
What about our mission

285
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,680
Is to catch the peddler

286
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
And only a few of you have seen that peddler

287
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,400
So your task is to identify the peddler

288
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I think so

289
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,480
Let's listen to the arrangement of our superiors

290
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,000
Just find this peddler

291
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,480
We can find out

292
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
The mole who assigned them tasks

293
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,440
That is, the launch of spy Zheng Qiang

294
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm sorry

295
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
Tian Zao has worked hard for you

296
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Let's go back first

297
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,040
Jujube

298
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,199
Why haven't you left yet? Why

299
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,160
I just

300
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm going. I'm going

301
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,439
Go to the toilet with a stomachache

302
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,400
I can tell you what

303
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Now the whole city is looking for you

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,520
Will this Zheng

305
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,240
Tell me about you

306
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,360
If he confesses me,

307
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Can I still sit here

308
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,640
Let me tell you clearly

309
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,920
Team leader Zheng met me that day and got away with it

310
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,400
I didn't get caught at all

311
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,800
This team leader Zheng's life is really big enough

312
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,360
There are several times when it looks like it will be folded

313
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,120
Let him slip away

314
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,160
I said, you are his patron saint

315
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,480
You take care of him

316
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,160
He is blessed with great fortune and great fortune

317
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,600
Now that the Communist Party knows

318
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,240
How did we tip Zheng Qiang off

319
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Then Zheng Qiang's men must have put the situation that day

320
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,160
Told the Communist Party

321
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,800
You are too dangerous now

322
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,280
Boss

323
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,040
You made me pretend to be a peddler

324
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,040
He was tipped off

325
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,400
Now you have a look

326
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,320
The street is catching peddlers

327
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
Sure, let them take it

328
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
Even if he arrested all the peddlers in Beijing,

329
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,760
You can't find me either

330
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,680
Nothing

331
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,320
I can't expose it

332
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
That's true.

333
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,520
Qin Defu, I know you are the dog spy

334
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll see where you're going today

335
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,000
She must not get out alive

336
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,160
Director Lin, why are you here

337
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't ask so many questions

338
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,920
Arrest people

339
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,160
Get up

340
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,800
Go

341
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,840
Jujube

342
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
Why do you think of following Qin Defu

343
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,080
I said from the beginning that this Qin

344
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
Not a good thing

345
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,800
Then no one believes me.

346
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
I thought about it later

347
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,520
Can't find this peddler

348
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
You have to find it for this peddler

349
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,600
The mole who tipped off

350
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,000
Who else can this mole have

351
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,480
It can only be the Qin

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
I just made a thought

353
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,160
I followed him

354
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,560
I followed for a few days

355
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
What about the first day

356
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,120
He entered the precinct and never came out again

357
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
I changed into casual clothes at night the next day

358
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,000
I went to a restaurant

359
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
After I came out, I felt something was wrong

360
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
I immediately followed up

361
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
As a result, he met several comrades in the branch office

362
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,200
Have a chat

363
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Back to the precinct

364
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,080
On the third day, he went to the police station in Dapeng

365
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,480
After coming out, I went back to the branch office

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
In the evening, he changed into casual clothes again

367
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,840
I just don't feel right

368
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Follow him all the way to the small yard

369
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,680
And then I saw the peddler

370
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,120
Chief, don't say it

371
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,200
I've been here for two days

372
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm hungry and thin without eating a full meal

373
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,120
Isn't that right, Sister Red Tassel

374
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
Jujube has worked hard

375
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,440
You're amazing

376
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,000
I didn't expect you to be young

377
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,360
Be so vigilant

378
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,880
It's quite alert

379
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,480
You said you did it

380
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Why didn't you tell me

381
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,040
The less people know about it, the better

382
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,360
You and me, you still keep secrets

383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
You are really good

384
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,560
But then again, jujube

385
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,320
Fortunately, Director Lin arrived in time

386
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,160
By the way, Director Lin

387
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,160
How did you find that yard

388
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Maybe you are also following Qin Defu

389
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Comrade Lin Zheng, since he knew it

390
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,160
What about after we have a spy inside

391
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,120
I began to suspect Qin Defu

392
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
He came to the city bureau to report to me

393
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,760
We set a plan for a city-wide

394
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,840
A plan to hunt down the peddler

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
The purpose is to startle the snake

396
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,720
Forcing this Qin Defu to contact the peddler

397
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,240
What do I say

398
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,200
Use so many police forces to catch peddlers

399
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
Even Tian Zao thinks it is unreliable

400
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
A wise leader like you

401
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,600
How can you use such absurd tricks

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,280
And it's for this

403
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,000
You just found out

404
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,040
Lao Lin

405
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
How did you suspect Qin Defu

406
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,360
Qin Defu

407
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,520
What about after liberation

408
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
The work is very active

409
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,040
I didn't find him with any spies either

410
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
What secret contact did you have

411
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,360
But there must be a sparse in every secret

412
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
When I knew there was a spy

413
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,040
What about the tipped off time

414
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,280
I wonder who this man is

415
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,800
Then I will put after liberation

416
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,600
All the major cases uncovered have been smoothed

417
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,000
I found one thing

418
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,400
What is it

419
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
For example

420
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,440
The assassination of this hospital

421
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,720
Before the female killer Zhou Ping was caught by us,

422
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,760
She was killed

423
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,440
And the time we caught Zheng Qiang, we threw ourselves into the air

424
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Zheng Qiang escaped

425
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,080
Including this time someone tipped off Zheng Qiang

426
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,240
I put all these things together

427
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,960
I found out

428
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,160
Every critical moment

429
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,720
There is more or less the shadow of Qin Defu

430
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,920
Is it

431
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
Director Lin, do you have proof

432
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Let's take the murder of Zhou Ping as an example

433
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,920
This is hidden in the precinct

434
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,360
The fake policeman surnamed Mu who killed her

435
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,120
It is through this Qin Defu

436
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
Knowing that Zhou Ping was exposed

437
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,920
Qin Defu told me at that time

438
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,600
He told Mu by accident

439
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
He is going to Jingxian County, Hebei Province to do external adjustment

440
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,400
I thought at that time that he didn't mean to leak it

441
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,240
It didn't take it too seriously

442
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,240
And then I went to jail

443
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
Arraigned this Mu

444
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
What about him? That's what he told me

445
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,120
This is yeah

446
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,920
It should be. It should be.

447
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,040
Lao Mu, come here for a minute

448
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,520
What do you want

449
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,480
That's true

450
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,800
That director Lin

451
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,920
Let me go to Jingxian County, Hebei Province to make an external adjustment

452
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,760
If you're okay

453
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,720
Come with me

454
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,360
Jingxian County, Hebei Province

455
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,920
External tone

456
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Investigate who

457
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Why do you ask so many questions

458
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,760
Don't you know when you go

459
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,520
Chief Qin, I have a lot of things at hand

460
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,520
It is not far from Jingxian County, Hebei Province

461
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
But once and for all,

462
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,520
It will take a day or two anyway

463
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,120
I really can't get away

464
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,840
Get get

465
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,960
You people won't listen to me either

466
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,000
Don't say that, don't you

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
How can I say it if I don't say so

468
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
I know you people

469
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,920
You won't listen to me

470
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
I'd better go alone

471
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,720
You have to be busy

472
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,240
You're busy

473
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,800
Qin Kechang

474
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
That is to say

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,800
This Qin Defu didn't unintentionally leak it

476
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,320
But he took the initiative

477
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
Go to Jingxian County to investigate Zhou Ping

478
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,040
To Mu

479
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,440
That's right

480
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
This Mu heard that it was Jingxian County

481
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,760
I knew it was exposed

482
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
So I didn't go with Qin Defu

483
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
But what about Mu

484
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,640
I didn't know this Qin Defu was a spy

485
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,200
He thought Qin Defu was asking him for help

486
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
This proves that

487
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,280
Qin Defu knew that this Mu was a spy

488
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,520
He did it on purpose

489
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,800
Tell this news to this Mu

490
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,560
And then there's that time

491
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,640
We designed to capture this Zheng Qiang

492
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Qin Defu was also present

493
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
Including this time

494
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
It could be Qin Defu

495
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
Deliberately looking for this peddler

496
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,760
Give a tip to Zheng

497
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,480
So from that moment on

498
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm just with Chief Gao

499
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
The design discussed this strategy of startling the snake

500
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,640
By tracking Qin Defu,

501
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Find this peddler

502
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,640
To prove that Qin Defu is a spy

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,920
In fact, when Lao Gang Lin told me about this matter,

504
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm not quite sure

505
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
Just trying my luck

506
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,160
I didn't expect to really catch it

507
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,120
Qin Defu, a spy

508
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,000
It's just that I didn't expect it

509
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,000
This comrade Tian Zao is so clever

510
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,280
She can think of following Qin Defu

511
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
What about the stalking these days? It's all in my eyes

512
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,840
I was going to stop her

513
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Because I'm afraid of her

514
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,840
Arouse this Qin Defu's vigilance

515
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,520
But then I found out

516
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,560
Comrade Tian Zao is more familiar with this terrain than I am

517
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,360
And this tracking skill is very superb

518
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
So I didn't stop her

519
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,720
I've been protecting Tian Zao in the dark

520
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
I said jujube

521
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
You really have to thank Director Lin

522
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,120
People are your saviors

523
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:14,960
Yes

524
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,760
I really want to thank Director Lin for this matter

525
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
But then again

526
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,400
I said from the beginning that this Qin Defu

527
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,560
He's a spy

528
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Not a good thing

529
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
But he doesn't believe me at all

530
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,960
If he had believed me long ago,

531
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,400
There can be so many things then

532
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,840
That Zheng didn't catch it long ago

533
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,280
That's right

534
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,800
Right, right, right. That's right

535
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,640
That's right

536
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,360
Jujube

537
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,880
What did you say happened to you just now

538
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
At least Director Lin also saved your life

539
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,840
You just talked like that

540
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,320
Let people feel more humiliating

541
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,840
I said it was the truth

542
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,680
He saved me and I thank him

543
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,480
But these are two different things

544
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,000
There's nothing I can do with you

545
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,040
Fortunately, Qin Defu has been arrested

546
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,000
Now Chief Gao is interrogating him

547
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,560
I believe Zheng Qiang can't hide for a few days

548
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,680
When you catch Zheng Qiang, a dog spy,

549
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,160
We can catch our breath

550
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,840
Do you know

551
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,000
I received a letter from Dayong

552
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,600
Really? When did it happen

553
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,080
Just for a few days

554
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,480
But I think that date

555
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
It has been mailed for two months

556
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,600
So what did he say

557
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
He said he was fine

558
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,840
And because he fought bravely,

559
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,520
He was also rewarded by his superiors

560
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,800
I also said I missed me. I missed the coal core

561
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,720
I miss Xiaofeng and I miss you

562
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,840
How nice

563
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,960
I didn't expect Dayong to become a hero

564
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm so happy for him

565
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,840
That's right

566
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,680
Dayong said it

567
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,120
Come back to eat our wedding candy

568
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
So when the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea ends,

569
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,320
We'll get married when he returns home

570
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,440
No

571
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,000
Row

572
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,600
Jujube

573
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
I see

574
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,720
I still have to hope

575
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,040
Soon

576
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,960
Qin Defu, Qin Defu

577
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
It really answers the old saying

578
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,960
Skynet is slow but not leaking

579
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,720
I didn't expect you to be a big Kuomintang spy

580
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Has been lurking by my side

581
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,480
But no matter how cunning the enemy is,

582
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,760
It will also show its trail

583
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,520
It's not

584
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,600
You're finally in your place

585
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,480
Director Lin, I have to thank you for this

586
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
Thank you for your attention in recent years

587
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,680
Come on, stop talking about it. It's useless

588
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,600
Go ahead, how can we catch Zheng Qiang

589
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Zheng Qiang

590
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
I think he is at this moment

591
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,080
Has become a street rat

592
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,640
I can't live in fear all day long

593
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,480
But after all, he is the elite of the Kuomintang

594
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,040
I have been operating in Beijing for so many years

595
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,960
People often say that the cunning rabbit has three caves

596
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,000
I think he may have eight caves and ten caves

597
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,400
Besides, he was hit so hard

598
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,400
I don't know where the cat is now

599
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,800
You want to arrest him

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
It's hard to go to the sky

601
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
Qin Defu

602
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,320
After all, you are in our government agencies

603
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,840
Working so long

604
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,720
The style of doing things to us Communists

605
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
It should be clear

606
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,840
After the founding of New China

607
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,440
I, Qin Defu, have the honor to be in the people's government

608
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,440
Working for a few years

609
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,320
To be honest, I really admire your Communist Party

610
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,520
Seeing the people around me live and work in peace and contentment

611
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,240
There is a smile on my face

612
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
There are no smokers left

613
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,840
There are no prostitutes left

614
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,240
Even the orphans begging on the street are gone

615
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,720
You communist cattle

616
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,200
It is a party that seeks the welfare of the common people

617
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
This is much better than our Kuomintang

618
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,960
After the outbreak of the Korean War

619
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,120
We still dream of the Third World War

620
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,440
Can start a fight

621
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
We have a chance to counterattack the mainland

622
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
But your army

623
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,960
I can't believe I beat all the Americans

624
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,200
This is something I never thought of

625
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,280
Counterattack the mainland

626
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,040
It's just daydreaming

627
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,040
Now all the party and state personnel lurking in Beijing

628
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,960
Have completely lost confidence

629
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,560
Eight words can best express our present

630
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
The situation at this moment

631
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
What eight words

632
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,720
The lost dog lingers

633
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,680
True portrayal

634
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,200
Qin Defu

635
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,160
Now that you have realized something,

636
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,960
Shouldn't we say something

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,280
All right

638
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,160
At present, only I can help you catch Zheng Qiang

639
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
I figured it out, too

640
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,960
He is hiding outside in Zheng Qiang

641
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,720
Live aimlessly

642
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
I can't escape later

643
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,720
The French Open of your Communist Party

644
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,920
It's better for me to die early and give birth early

645
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,840
I also have a companion on the road to death

646
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,759
And there is it

647
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:20,799
I want to do something last for the people in Beijing

648
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,040
Also accumulate some virtues for yourself in the next life

649
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,520
Row

650
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,439
Go ahead

651
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,318
How to catch Zheng Qiang

652
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,640
You want to arrest Zheng Qiang

653
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,679
The first thing to do is

654
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,640
Block the news that I was caught

655
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:49,640
You can rest assured

656
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:52,120
We are already doing this

657
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,319
I'm sure you will

658
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,759
But this news won't be blocked for long

659
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,160
Three days later

660
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,759
It is the day when Zheng Qiang and I agreed to meet

661
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,120
He is sure to arrive

662
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,680
Coming

663
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
Can I not come

664
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,080
I went back from here that day

665
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,880
I found my assistant surrounded by the Communists

666
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,840
Thanks to my meeting you here the other day

667
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Or now

668
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,520
I have also become a prisoner of the Communist Party

669
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,560
Sir, you don't know this month

670
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,920
How did I get by

671
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
It's called darkness

672
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,320
I can't even go out to buy stutterers

673
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,640
I found countless pairs of eyes staring at me

674
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Sir, I'm begging you

675
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,720
You keep up with the peak and plead for me

676
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,520
Let me get out of Beijing quickly

677
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
This horrible city

678
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,200
I can't live if I want to stay any longer

679
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,760
Zheng Qiang, you can also be relieved

680
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,000
Mr. Night Wolf, we finally meet

681
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,720
Good

682
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,320
Master

683
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,760
The Kunqu Opera you sang today

684
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,720
It's different from the usual Xipi Erhuang

685
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Coal core

686
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
I hear it

687
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,040
Master tells you something

688
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,960
This Kunqu Opera is also called Kunqu Opera

689
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
A graceful line

690
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,760
Be known for lingering, tactful, soft and distant

691
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,840
What pays attention to is a sudden setback

692
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,720
And pronunciation

693
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,040
The water mill cavity we often use

694
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,520
In addition to one board, three eyes, one board and one eye,

695
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
There is also a gift board song

696
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,760
Flat up and in

697
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,280
That is to say, when singing every word,

698
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,960
Pay attention to the head, abdomen and tail of pronunciation

699
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,080
That is, pronunciation and radio

700
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,760
Do you understand

701
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
Sister, you want me

702
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,680
Xiaozao, a volunteer comrade

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,360
He has something to tell you

704
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,680
Hello, Comrade Volunteer Army

705
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,840
What can I do for you

706
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,520
You must be Comrade Tian Zao

707
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,240
I am

708
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,760
Comrade Sui Dayong is your brother

709
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,840
Yes, Dayong is my brother

710
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,040
Although not my own brother

711
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,560
But growing up with me

712
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,680
Is something wrong with Dayong

713
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,240
Comrade Tian Zao, here's the thing

714
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
After five battles

715
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,080
Volunteer Korean People's Army

716
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,360
There are also armistice negotiations between the US and the United States

717
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,080
During this time

718
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,800
Although the large-scale armed exchange of fire has stopped,

719
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,440
However, small-scale exchanges of fire still occur from time to time

720
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,720
The company where Comrade Sui Dayong is located

721
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,520
In the execution of a mission

722
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,960
Ambushed by American imperialist troops

723
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,280
Comrade Sui Dayong showed great bravery and tenacity

724
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,040
But in the final retreat

725
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,360
He tried to cover his troops

726
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,480
Glorious sacrifice

727
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,120
Jujube

728
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,640
Dayong died to cover his comrades

729
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,040
He is a hero

730
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,080
He is a good son of the Chinese people

731
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,040
He didn't embarrass your sister

732
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,840
That's right. Comrade Sui Dayong fought tenaciously and bravely

733
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,200
When he entered the DPRK to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea,

734
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
Repeatedly achieve good results

735
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,600
He also therefore

736
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,720
Received the appreciation and commendation of Zhi Si

737
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,640
He was also awarded

738
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,280
Good news of a first-class combat hero

739
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,720
And a certificate of honor

740
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,920
He was also subjected to the command of the Korean People's Army

741
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,080
The Warrior Medal of Honor awarded

742
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
Comrade Sui Dayong is a true

743
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,120
A veritable fighting hero

744
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,960
Where's my brother's body

745
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,080
The remains of Comrade Sui Dayong

746
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,480
And other thousands of sacrifices in Qian Qian

747
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,920
The volunteers on the Korean battlefield are the same

748
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,000
Are buried in North Korea

749
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,920
He will continue to guard there

750
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,320
Three thousand miles of mountains and rivers in Korea

751
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
These are the relics of Sui Dayong before his death

752
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,080
His former combat unit commissioned me

753
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,960
Give it to his family
