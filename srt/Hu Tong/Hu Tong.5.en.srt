1
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,920
Eat slowly. No one will rob you

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
Delicious. Delicious

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,200
If you often want to eat this delicious food,

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,120
Promise you one thing

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
What did you say

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,600
Be my apprentice

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,400
Shall I teach you to sing opera

8
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,520
It's boring

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,080
What do you know

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,640
On your terms

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Study hard with me for a few years

12
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Maybe it really becomes a corner

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
If you really become a horn,

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
That can make a lot of money

15
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,720
After having money, ah

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,320
You can eat anything delicious in the sky

17
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
Is it true or not

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,480
Aren't you also a horn

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Why didn't I see it

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,840
You make a lot of money every day

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
Aren't you just like us

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Do you eat steamed corn-bread and chew vegetables every day

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,160
I was in a bad situation

24
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,160
I think your big brother was in Beijing

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
That's a big corner

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,120
Whenever I perform,

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,880
This lady purse gold ring

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,360
Throw it on the stage assiduously

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
I can't even pick it up

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,200
What does the gold ring look like, Brother Tong

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,920
Eat it, you little money fanatic

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,960
At present, a number of people have been found to have sneaked into Beiping

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Traces of the assassination of the leader's spy

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Follow-up investigation is underway

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,200
What about our mission

36
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Is to cooperate with this city military management Committee

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,880
And the work of the city bureau

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
Continue to check this segment

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,160
Objects of emphasis

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
It's those who used to be spies

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,000
And those foreign suspects

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,160
Be ready to arrest at any time

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,760
I'll set it up next

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
The next stage

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,600
This plan to investigate and arrest spies

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
There's nothing good

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Make do with eating

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
Come on, come on, move chopsticks quickly

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
Don't say that, Uncle

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
We can eat these dishes these days

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
It's quite ok

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Get it

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,280
Your uncle is an ancestral craft

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
I used to do it in a big restaurant

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,120
Later, I went to the stall to sell fried tripe

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,240
You can eat your uncle's craftsmanship

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
It's all my light

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
This is really

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,840
This is back then

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
I don't go to his restaurant less

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
Eat the dishes cooked by your chef

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,560
That's right

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,120
Where to go back is not to eat and drink

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,720
I also asked our family to settle the account

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm so ashamed hey

66
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
Not auntie

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
Why don't you mention any pot?

68
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,360
Just bring the coal core

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Try this zongzi

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,519
Do you eat zongzi

71
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,440
It is also this rice dumpling leaf that is fragrant

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,079
Right

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,199
Your uncle

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Why is there no date here

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Smelly coal core

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
It's good to eat glutinous rice dumplings

77
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,040
What jujube do you want

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Want to eat jujube

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
Come and eat your sister

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Come and eat your sister

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,440
Eat your sister

82
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
It's really jujube and here

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
So delicious

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Iron egg

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,280
Our family date is already over eighteen

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,320
When are you going to marry her

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
Aunt is so upset

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,840
Why are you saying this

89
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
It has to be said

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,480
Jujube sister

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
We can wait to eat your wedding candy

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
What are you talking about

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
Jujube You and Iron Egg

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,440
It's like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Absolute fairy match

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,960
With a mouthful of nonsense

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Let me catch the kidnapper

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
It's starting again

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,880
If you want to say that iron eggs are cowherd, that's almost the same

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
The Weaver Girl

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
That's the Heavenly Queen's daughter coming down to earth

102
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
Our Tian Zao

103
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,240
That's the authentic proletariat

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,440
Right

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
All right, Suo Ye

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
It's really short for you to hold

107
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Come

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
Have one

109
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Lots of ink

110
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Stop giggling

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
Wipe your mouth and leave after eating

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Don't make a different price

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
I-I haven't had enough

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
No, I haven't stayed with you enough yet

115
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,480
Come on, come on, have some

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,880
Eat more, eat more, eat more

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,320
Silly girl

118
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,840
This iron egg is your father's apprentice

119
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
You two grew up together

120
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,600
He is a reliable man

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
You have such a man around you to take care of you

122
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
Then you can rest assured

123
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,280
I don't need a man to take care of me

124
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,320
I have you

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,960
There are your uncle, three brothers and four brothers

126
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
So many people take care of me

127
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
You don't need a man

128
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
That can take care of you all your life

129
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,080
The old man has to go first

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,080
Your parents left early

131
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
Although you have been an orphan for a long time

132
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,400
I've always taken you with me as my own daughter

133
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
I have to watch my daughter go out

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,400
Then my heart is steadfast

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
Come on, don't send the dates

136
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,760
Go home quickly

137
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,360
Aunt said that today

138
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
Are you listening

139
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,120
What what words

140
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,960
Why don't you just marry me

141
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Why don't you like it

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
No, no, no

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
Who, who, who, who is not happy

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,720
I wish I could

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,440
It's too late for me to be happy

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
All right, then let's do it

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
You find someone to fix a good day

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
We'll take care of it

149
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
You can come and stay with me

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,720
I can stay at your place

151
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
It's close anyway

152
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,040
But this, this, this

153
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,960
It's such a big thing to marry a daughter-in-law

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
You don't have to be so hasty, do you

155
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,280
What a haste

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
Isn't it me holding the pillow

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
Or you're holding the pillow

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Go there for a while

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't that all

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,480
Here's the word

161
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,200
But after all, such a big thing

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,960
I have to give my parents a whisper at least

163
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
It's not easy

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll go to your house one day

165
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,840
Knock your head to your aunt and uncle

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,520
Don't parents get together when they shout

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
Besides, it's not like you don't know

168
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
His old couple have long regarded me as their daughter-in-law

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
I took my hand that day and said

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
Ask me when I will go through the door

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,440
OK, then how about this

172
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
I thought you asked me to fix a date

173
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Seeing that the Communist Party is about to run the founding ceremony

174
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
After the founding of New China, let's wait

175
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,560
I'll marry you

176
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,560
It's up to us

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
You have to be a couple in new China

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,440
OK, you can say so.

179
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,360
It's settled

180
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
When will the Communist Party hold founding ceremony

181
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
We'll get married one day

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
OK, then that's it

183
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,600
That's right

184
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
Secret agents lurking in Peiping for assassination

185
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,880
Do you have a clue

186
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,880
That's the case that the city bureau is responsible for

187
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
What about our branch office? It's just cooperation

188
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
What about the specific situation

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
They haven't told me yet

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
I don't know

191
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640
I saw jujube the other day

192
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,720
The child hides when he sees me

193
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,800
You haven't given up on her yet

194
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,160
What's the matter

195
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,160
I think the child is quite good

196
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,120
Kindness, integrity and enthusiasm

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Is a good prospect

198
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Some other time

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
I'll find a chance to have a good talk with her again

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,000
Try to untie this knot in her heart

201
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
Red tassel, red tassel

202
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,920
How many times have I told you that you just won't listen to me

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,960
If you are willing to take this trouble, you can take it

204
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,880
What you said

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
I don't think jujube is a problem

206
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,640
On the contrary, I think Xiaozao will be in the future

207
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
Will be a good helper in my work

208
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
Why are you looking at me

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
I hope so

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
My guest, you are here

211
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
Please come inside

212
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Do you have a private room

213
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes

214
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,720
Two guests, please take a private room upstairs

215
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,960
Master, you come to your seat

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,080
What would you like to eat today, gentlemen

217
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,520
According to this money, you can watch the match

218
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,400
Get it

219
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Sit down for a while

220
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,600
Big Brother, the streets are full of PLA

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
We're not being targeted

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
It can't be

223
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,640
We have only been in Beiping for two days

224
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,240
No matter how powerful the Communist Party is

225
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,360
It can't be so fast

226
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Just find our trail

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
Think about how to get away

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,880
What would you like to eat, Master Jun

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
We're not here for dinner

230
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
We're here on a mission

231
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,120
Search

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,440
Big Brother, they're coming up soon

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,080
What shall we do

234
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,480
Go

235
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,800
Keep up

236
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,960
This friend, please stay

237
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
Who are you guys

238
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,840
Why are you following me

239
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,040
Don't worry, my friend

240
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,120
We are probably the same people

241
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
Who is with you

242
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,120
Somebody put up their hands

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,400
Go in

244
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,440
Instructor Sun, why are you

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,680
What are you talking about

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,080
Who is your instructor

247
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,520
Who are you? You

248
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
You don't know me anymore

249
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,360
I am the Beiping spy training class of the Secrecy Bureau

250
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,840
Liang Liqun in the second phase

251
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
At that time, you were our martial arts instructor

252
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
I am your student

253
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,320
Keep your voice down for me

254
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,960
I don't-I don't know you two

255
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm not an instructor either

256
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,640
I am a common man with a flat head

257
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,920
Right, right, right

258
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
We are all flat-cut people

259
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
They are all flat-headed people

260
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,360
It must be you

261
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
Give me your whereabouts

262
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
Lead the soldier to the restaurant

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Even I was stewed in a pot

264
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,920
Instructor wronged

265
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,280
We have only been in Peiping for a few days

266
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,680
Who knew the soldier was after us

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Haven't you two been lurking in Peiping

268
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Don't mention it

269
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,000
You are not an outsider either

270
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
It doesn't matter to tell you

271
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,520
Before the People's Liberation Army entered the city,

272
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Several of our backbone members have been transferred to the south

273
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,040
Send us back this time

274
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
It's a mission

275
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
What kind of mission

276
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Then don't ask

277
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,480
The mouth is quite strict

278
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,360
I have to be talkative

279
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,240
Jujube

280
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
I looked for you several times and you didn't see me

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
What's going on today

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Come to think of boarding my door, sister

283
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,560
Iron egg is missing

284
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,320
Missing

285
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,960
Missing

286
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,960
I can't find it in any way

287
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,320
I have found all the places to find

288
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,600
No one lives, no body dies

289
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm really at my wits' end

290
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
I can only come to you to find a way

291
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't worry

292
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,120
Go inside and talk to me first

293
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,880
Dayong, you come with me

294
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,600
Xiaofeng, take them and continue to find someone

295
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
OK, go quickly

296
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Go

297
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,520
Go, go, go

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
All the places have been searched

299
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,560
Yes, it's called iron egg

300
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,640
What's his name

301
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,080
Big name

302
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,240
Daimyo, you won't even have the name of an iron egg

303
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,360
I know I know I'm in a hurry

304
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,680
Sun Tie Sun Tie

305
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,440
Sun Tie is probably in his early twenties

306
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,760
About one meter eight

307
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,440
There is no serious occupation

308
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,120
He is a wrestler who practices wrestling and teaches apprentices

309
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,160
OK, then let me know if there is any news

310
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,920
Okay okay thank you

311
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,479
How's it going, Chief

312
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,719
Jujube, don't worry yet

313
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
I've been on the phone with several precincts

314
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,760
Where are they now

315
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,600
Split up and find out the whereabouts of this Sun Tie

316
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,719
There should be news soon

317
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,920
Where can such a big man go

318
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,719
Jujube

319
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,840
Now tell me in detail

320
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
What is your relationship with this iron egg

321
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,920
What is the family background

322
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,840
What have you done over the years

323
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,640
I'll tell you everything I know

324
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,160
You are my eldest brother's instructor

325
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,920
Taught him for a few days

326
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Instructor of Beiping spy training class

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
That must be somebody

328
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm not a big shot.

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,680
Just know

330
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't talk to me everywhere

331
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,640
Can't

332
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,000
Who are we

333
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
We are loyal ministers of the party and state

334
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,600
How many times have you been in court in these two days

335
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,200
We grabbed the Kouga

336
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
Half a word doesn't jump out

337
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,320
Yeah

338
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
Let me tell you something

339
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,480
Being like us

340
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,040
Once you let go, it's death

341
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,400
Truth and wisdom

342
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,560
We must not let the Communist Party suppress it

343
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,960
Hold it

344
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,920
Hold it

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,600
May

346
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,200
When will it end? You say

347
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,560
You said the Communists decided we were spies

348
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
I have to take it sooner or later

349
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
Look at you like that. You

350
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,960
No

351
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
It's not my business

352
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,720
You know, right

353
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
This time, this thing

354
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,560
It's really too big

355
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,160
I'm afraid I can't carry it

356
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,040
Brother, I understand you

357
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,160
You said that the two of us are now

358
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
It can also be regarded as a comrade-in-arms sharing hardships

359
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,480
Why don't you just tell me about it

360
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
You two come to Peiping this time

361
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,520
What important task is it to perform

362
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,800
It stands to reason

363
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
I can't tell you about it

364
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,560
You know, right

365
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
But I think you are also a famous man

366
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
He is also a loyal minister of the party and state

367
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
Have another relationship with my big brother

368
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,680
I just want to talk to someone close to me these two days

369
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,920
Otherwise, my stomach will be uncomfortable

370
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,960
I mumble to you

371
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Not reluctantly

372
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't say it if you don't want to

373
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Go inside the rotten belly

374
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Didn't I just want to tell you

375
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,560
You blocked it back for me again

376
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,440
You want to suffocate me. You want to

377
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,280
Come on, come on, you want to say it, you can say it quickly

378
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,160
Assassination

379
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,360
Assassination

380
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I made this happen

381
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,800
Can get twenty large yellow croakers

382
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,520
I don't have to worry about eating and drinking in my life

383
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to go to town if I was killed.

384
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,520
Yes, brother

385
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,240
Make a lot of money

386
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,120
So much money

387
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
Who are you trying to assassinate

388
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,200
Communist Party officials

389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,320
There are more Communist Party officials

390
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
A great official

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,720
They will have a celebration in a few days

392
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,360
We'll do it that day

393
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
Also a big official

394
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Do you think you deserve it just like you

395
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,800
We can't do it, can we

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,720
But our brothers will create chaos

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
Grab their attention

398
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,480
When the real killer appears

399
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,320
Begin

400
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,440
Chug them

401
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,560
There are other killers besides you two

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm telling you

403
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,800
Just that guy

404
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
He is the top master under Mao Renfeng's bureau

405
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,280
All-over skills, all-over abilities

406
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,800
So powerful

407
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,520
Who's that got to be

408
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,360
Don't know

409
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,120
My big brother knows about him

410
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,480
But I know that he has lurked in Beiping recently

411
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Are you having a good time

412
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
It's so good. It's so good

413
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,320
I told you these two days

414
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm so full of words that I want to say it

415
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
It suffocates me

416
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
Stop here

417
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,600
Go inside the rotten belly

418
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,800
Stopped in the rotten stomach

419
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
Xiaozao, don't worry

420
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,280
Trust the government

421
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm sure I can find out his whereabouts

422
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,160
How's it going, Chief

423
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
Several sub-bureaus have answered letters

424
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,320
Sun Tie's whereabouts have not been found

425
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
Dapeng went to the outer suburbs to do investigation

426
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,160
I didn't find any trace of him either

427
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,600
Jujube

428
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Don't you cry

429
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,280
Sister, I'm going to marry him

430
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,440
You said there was no one left

431
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,160
Can I not feel bad

432
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Jujube

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,040
According to what you provided

434
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,680
What about Sun Tie's identity background

435
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
We did another detailed investigation

436
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
Found a particularly bad situation

437
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,880
What happened

438
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
It stands to reason

439
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
Such a thing should not be told to you

440
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
But since he's your fiance

441
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,760
I'll tell you the truth

442
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
According to our investigation

443
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,240
Before liberation, this Sun Tie

444
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,960
Once in the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

445
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,960
I worked as a martial arts instructor in the special police training class

446
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,560
No, it's impossible

447
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
Iron egg can't be a spy

448
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,760
You must have made a mistake

449
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
You guys check it out again

450
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,280
Xiaozao, don't worry

451
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,440
Could Lao Lin have made a mistake

452
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
Absolutely right, Sister Red Tassel

453
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,560
We went from the spy in custody

454
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
And have been confirmed in the spy files

455
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
Sun Tie is their instructor

456
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,400
That is to say

457
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,440
Sun Tie is probably a latent spy

458
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,920
Then say so

459
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
It's impossible for him

460
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,440
Was caught by our police

461
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,040
Several prisons in Peiping have my comrades in arms

462
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,200
I've inquired about it all

463
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,720
There is no one named Sun Tie among the prisoners

464
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,600
According to the present situation, ah

465
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,960
It is very likely that Sun Tie has left Peiping

466
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,040
I went to the south to go to the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

467
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,960
It is impossible

468
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
Iron egg can't be a spy

469
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,280
Jujube

470
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,040
Good

471
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Good

472
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
Good

473
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,280
Good good

474
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,360
Good good

475
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,840
Good good

476
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
It is impossible

477
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Absolutely impossible, sister

478
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,320
There is a saying I don't know when to say it properly

479
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
Say something quickly

480
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,560
Listen to this chief today

481
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,200
I do remember one thing

482
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
What's the matter? Say it

483
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,320
Sister, do you still remember

484
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,360
You were caught by Han Qingkui that day

485
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
Then I couldn't help it that day

486
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,520
I went to find Brother Iron Egg

487
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Brother Iron Egg will take us with him

488
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,800
Did you go to Han Fu to rob you

489
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,240
I didn't even intend to come back alive that day

490
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
I didn't expect Han Qingkui

491
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Let you go so easily

492
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,440
And

493
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,480
I remember when Brother Iron Egg

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,720
Han Qingkui was beaten up

495
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,960
Sister, don't forget

496
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,760
That Han has a gun in his hand

497
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,120
I don't think that's right, either

498
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,520
Then I asked Iron Egg

499
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
But he made a careless eye and passed away

500
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,800
Right

501
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,160
And the most important thing is

502
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,520
I remember Han Qingkui at that time

503
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Already pointed the gun at Brother Iron Egg

504
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,120
Just when Han Qingkui was about to shoot

505
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,520
Someone came out of this room

506
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,880
It should be his bookkeeper, sir

507
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
I came over and said a few words to him

508
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
Then Han Qingkui went back to the house

509
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,640
After Han Qingkui came out of the house in a short time,

510
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,480
Just tell his men to release people

511
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
No, this is too strange, sister

512
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,160
Sister, do you think it will be

513
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,040
What did someone in this room say to him

514
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Go quickly

515
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,640
Walk, walk

516
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,080
Walk

517
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,400
Go quickly

518
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Go quickly

519
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,240
Sister

520
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,840
What are you thinking

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,280
Dayong, you listen to me

522
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,520
All the iron eggs that Director Lin said today

523
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,200
You can't say a word out

524
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,680
Never let the neighbors know

525
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,680
Did you hear that

526
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,640
I heard you, sister

527
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
Don't worry

528
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
I will never tell

529
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
I haven't eaten your cooking for a long time

530
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,840
I was thinking about it

531
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,920
You said the iron egg suddenly disappeared at this time

532
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Is there anything to do with the assassination

533
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,200
I can't say

534
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
Jujube is too poor

535
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,560
The child has a strong temper

536
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,240
This iron egg is her childhood sweetheart again

537
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,560
At this time, I suddenly found iron eggs

538
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,400
Suspected of this spy

539
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,720
You said she was her temper

540
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Can she bear this psychology

541
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,680
Where's the little jujube

542
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,920
Although the work is very active,

543
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
The ability is also very strong

544
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,960
But after all, she is young and emotional

545
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
She is easy to go from this extreme

546
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,600
Jump to the other extreme

547
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,280
She's like a time bomb

548
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,200
Maybe it will blow up sometime

549
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,280
Again, the same sentence

550
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
You should stay at a respectful distance from her

551
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't listen to you in this matter

552
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,680
Now is the time when Xiaozao needs help most

553
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
If we just give up

554
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,120
She may well have sunk down

555
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
Such a good seedling

556
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
I can't leave it alone

557
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,360
You decide your work in the future

558
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
My job is my decision

559
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,480
See what I'm doing eating

560
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,960
What's the matter

561
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,000
Don't you think I'm ugly

562
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,040
If you think I'm ugly, find someone else

563
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,560
No

564
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,200
Do you know how to chat

565
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,440
Who thinks you are ugly

566
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,240
Besides, who else can I call?

567
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,120
Give it to me

568
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,200
Jujube sister

569
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,000
Zaojie Zaojie Zaojie

570
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
Practice, practice, practice

571
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,080
Sister Zao, did you find my master

572
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
You said my master

573
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,280
I didn't say hello. Where have you been? This is

574
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm here today to ask about your master

575
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,080
Ask me, Master. What did you say you asked

576
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
Recently, your master

577
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,600
Is there anything wrong with it

578
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,320
No, ah

579
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,800
Take us to practice before dawn every day

580
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
Rain or shine

581
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,120
Before the army entered the city,

582
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,840
Is there anything wrong with it

583
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Army march

584
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,480
You have to say so

585
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Before the liberation of Beiping

586
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,640
There were two or three days a week during that time

587
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Master didn't come

588
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,000
I know that

589
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,720
Iron egg told me

590
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
Said I went to other wrestling grounds some time ago

591
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,800
I went to find other wrestlers to study wrestling

592
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,600
My master told you so

593
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,320
That's what you told me

594
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,760
I also said that you went to pick other people's venues

595
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,240
He told me that he would never do it

596
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,280
Is to study wrestling and learn martial arts

597
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,920
It is impossible

598
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
My master is in high spirits

599
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,480
These wrestlers in Beiping are not in his eyes

600
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,200
Usually other wrestlers

601
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,760
Come here and play a game

602
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,520
Master has never been to another venue

603
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,680
No

604
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,760
What you said is true

605
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Jujube sister

606
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,040
Don't you know who my master is

607
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
To talk about wrestling

608
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,360
He didn't say that he was invincible when he fell all over Peiping

609
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
That's one of the best, isn't it

610
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,520
Does he deserve to learn from others

611
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Usually, Master is a thousand instructions

612
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,000
Tell us

613
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,320
It's a family who fell in Beiping

614
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,400
It's not easy for everyone to eat together

615
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,120
Don't let us make trouble in other people's wrestling grounds

616
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,840
Kicking field

617
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
What you said about meeting friends with military forces

618
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
What do you think he can do

619
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
What's the matter, Jujube

620
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,000
Nothing

621
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,840
You guys practice

622
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,320
Aunt and uncle

623
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
Here comes the jujube

624
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,040
Here comes the jujube

625
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,480
Come and sit here

626
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Come and sit here

627
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,280
What's the matter, Jujube

628
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,440
A drooping face

629
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,200
It's like who owes you 300 cranes

630
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,360
Iron egg has been missing for several days

631
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,200
I can't find it in any way

632
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm in a hurry

633
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,040
Urgent

634
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,840
What's the rush

635
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,000
He's so big

636
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,520
Another martial arts

637
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,200
He's okay. Don't worry

638
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,160
Not aunt

639
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,400
Your son hasn't been seen for several days

640
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
I can't find it at all

641
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,120
Are you in no hurry

642
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
The child

643
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,520
I thought I said

644
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,120
He's so big

645
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,320
He's okay. Don't worry

646
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
Wouldn't you be

647
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,680
Do you know where the iron eggs are

648
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
Jujube is not an outsider, just tell her

649
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,120
Iron egg left in a hurry that day

650
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,000
He told us that he would go out for a few days on business

651
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,600
Let's not worry

652
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
Did he tell you where he went

653
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
That's not true

654
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,600
He dropped a sentence when he left

655
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,040
That's right

656
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,440
He said let's not tell anyone

657
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,640
After that, he ran away like burning his ass

658
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,600
Did he take anything with him when he left

659
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,359
He doesn't live in the same room with us

660
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,839
Did he take anything with him when he left

661
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,160
How do I know

662
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,839
Since he left a message to do business,

663
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,200
Then I'm much more relieved

664
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,799
Since it's nothing, are you busy

665
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,799
I'm going back

666
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Jujube, let's go after dinner

667
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm not eating coals waiting for me

668
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,359
Jujube, don't worry

669
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,680
I'll ask Iron Egg to find you immediately when I come back.

670
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,040
You said that iron egg is a child

671
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,160
I don't tell anyone when I leave.

672
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,200
It makes people and children in such a hurry

673
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,280
This thing that is less than four or six

674
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,120
Bai Chang is so big

675
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,840
Dad

676
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,840
You are really blind

677
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,240
What apprentice did you teach

678
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,160
Iron egg, he is a spy, do you know

679
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Mother

680
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,880
You put your daughter's happiness in the next life

681
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
Are entrusted to this

682
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,400
Wolf-hearted dog spy

683
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,360
This lets the neighborhood know where my face is going

684
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,000
Comrade Sun Tie has worked hard

685
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,720
Not hard

686
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Team leader Wu Feng

687
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,600
It is my honor to work for the party

688
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,720
I would die

689
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,920
What is a few days in jail

690
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,320
Well said

691
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,720
Come and sit down

692
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,680
Let's sit down and talk

693
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,440
According to the information you provided,

694
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,800
The Social Affairs Department of the CPC Central Committee mobilized a large amount of information

695
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,640
Our investigation department has gone through various channels

696
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,240
Investigation and analysis were carried out

697
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,960
What we can be sure of at present is that

698
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,640
Several famous killers under Mao Renfeng

699
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,880
Two of them went to Taiwan with Chen Cheng

700
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,920
There are also two Mao Renfeng

701
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,560
Surveying Yunnan Wang Longyun in Southwest China

702
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,920
The rest of them

703
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,600
Has been active in big cities south of the Yangtze River

704
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
Among them is a famous killer

705
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,640
Appeared in Tianjin not long ago

706
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
But there was no trace of this person at the end of last month

707
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,280
According to the information you provided,

708
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
We speculate that this person is very likely

709
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,440
It was this assassination

710
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,560
The important killer among them

711
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,600
This instructor Sun can't bear it, can he

712
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,680
Why did he take so long

713
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,200
Don't give up my work at the training class any more

714
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
But fortunately, he didn't know

715
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,320
The mission we are here to perform this time

716
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,520
It's a big deal to prove it

717
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,720
I just went to spy training class

718
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,440
Big Brother

719
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,560
I was wrong I was wrong

720
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,600
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you

721
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,280
Brother, the day you were arraigned

722
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,760
Instructor Sun asked me

723
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,120
What are we doing in Peiping

724
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,880
I told him without holding my mouth

725
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,160
You bastard

726
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,200
Just your quick mouth, big brother

727
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,480
Just your quick mouth, big brother

728
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,880
Big brother, save me, big brother

729
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,240
Group

730
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,520
All right, all right, all right

731
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,440
I told him to say it

732
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,600
You're going to hit someone, aren't you

733
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,000
Come on, come on

734
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,880
Hit me

735
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,080
Instructor, you give me 10,000 bravery

736
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,760
I dare not start with you either

737
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,320
Besides

738
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,880
Isn't it death to fight with you

739
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,480
I can't beat it either

740
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,760
How can I be so unlucky

741
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,760
How did I get together with you two

742
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,720
I also asked the Communist Party to even the pot for me

743
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,120
If they really think of me as a killer,

744
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Do you say I am not wronged

745
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,760
What I'm most wronged about is that you two still don't tell me the truth

746
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,280
The smelly boy who should have said it would have told you before

747
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,520
Tell what

748
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,520
You two are wannabe at best

749
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,080
A scapegoat

750
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,680
Who is the real killer

751
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,160
Do you dare to tell me

752
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,560
I really dare not tell you my life

753
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,400
Row

754
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,600
Row

755
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,840
Just say this to you

756
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,000
You are better than him

757
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,200
Don't waste the cultivation of you by the party and the state

758
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,080
Instructor, forgive me

759
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,320
Luo Wenhui has been in town for several days

760
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,080
Instructor Sun

761
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,640
How did you know Luo Ye was here

762
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,640
Nonsense

763
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,760
You think the Secret Service sent you two here

764
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,200
What am I doing in a restaurant

765
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
Just to help you two get away

766
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,840
You are one of us

767
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,480
Join in this operation together

768
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,680
What do you say

769
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
Look at your big brother

770
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,240
I told you to grow some brains after that

771
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
You don't ask indiscriminately

772
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Give me a smelly beating, you say

773
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
Am I wronged or not wronged

774
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,480
Instructor is my eye-catching

775
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,920
You brought you into trouble to save us

776
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,760
And I'm hiding it from you

777
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
Okay, okay, okay, okay

778
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,320
Now is not the time to blame each other

779
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
Help each other in the same boat to go to the national disaster

780
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,720
Prepare to be benevolent

781
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
No way

782
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,520
Do we really have no way to live

783
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,080
You two didn't see it

784
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,760
Who are the people who have been tried in court these two days

785
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,240
They are all people involved in this assassination

786
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,840
This shows that the Communist Party

787
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,040
Has treated us like killers

788
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,200
How exactly did they know

789
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,240
I don't know

790
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,200
But there's no way they'll spare us

791
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,520
Now we can only pray that Chief Luo

792
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
Can successfully complete the task

793
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,320
We're dead

794
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,640
You can also be rewarded by the party and the state

795
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,840
Otherwise, we are really too wronged

796
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,720
You know what I fear most right now

797
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,200
I'm most afraid that Chief Luo's identity will be exposed

798
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Don't be caught by the Communist Party

799
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,920
It won't

800
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,000
Chief Luo's skill

801
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,840
Hiding and so hidden

802
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,040
The Communist Party can't catch him so easily

803
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,360
Concealment

804
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,880
The Communist Party is already in Peiping

805
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,520
Set up tight encirclement

806
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,560
Where is there a safe place?

807
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,480
Where Luo Ye hid

808
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,080
It is the most famous in Beiping

809
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
Slums and grocery places

810
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,600
The most miscellaneous and chaotic place
