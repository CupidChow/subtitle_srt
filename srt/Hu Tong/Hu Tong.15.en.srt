1
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,040
If I love you

2
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
It's never like a climbing trumpet creeper

3
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,480
Show off yourself by your tall branches

4
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
If I love you

5
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,360
Never learn from infatuated birds

6
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
Repeat monotonous songs for the shade

7
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,600
It's not just like a spring

8
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,160
Send cool comfort all the year round

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It's not just like a dangerous peak

10
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Increase your height

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,840
Set off your dignity

12
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
Even sunlight and even spring rain

13
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,680
No, these are not enough

14
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,040
I must be a kapok near you

15
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,160
Standing with you as the image of a tree

16
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,600
Roots clenched in the ground

17
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,720
Leaves touch each other in the clouds

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,640
This is the great love

19
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
Faithfulness is here

20
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Love

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,880
Not only love your mighty body

22
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,000
Love the position you insist on more

23
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,480
The land under the first step

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Thank you Xiaomin

25
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Bring us such beautiful poems

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,480
All right

27
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,760
Everyone knows that

28
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,520
Shu Ting Liang Xiaobin

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
River index finger Munk

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,600
Their poems are in a rebellious spirit

31
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
It breaks the principle that we create with realism

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,760
The situation of unifying poetry circles

33
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,680
It also brings new vitality to poetry

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,400
It is also literature in the new period

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,160
Bring about a far-reaching change

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
In their poems

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Thinking about Human Nature with Realistic Consciousness

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Affirm human self-worth and dignity

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
At the same time, pay attention to the creative subject

40
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
The expression of inner feelings

41
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,360
All right, I'm here for everyone

42
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,480
Read a new poem of mine

43
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,959
Weimin, read it quickly

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,080
We are all waiting to hear your masterpiece

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,079
Good good

46
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,520
Yes, Weimin, hurry up

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,560
Don't dare, don't dare

48
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
Poetry "Winter Night"

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,240
Is there a sound when the residual snow melts

50
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,640
Who has heard the sound of the old locust tree breathing

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Under the dim street lamp

52
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,960
A gecko with a broken tail jumped off the wall

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Scared away two ants

54
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Juanzi

55
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,480
Stick one with my brother

56
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
Who will post it with you

57
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
If you want to post it, find someone else to post it

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,400
Dong Zi

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,800
What for

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Let's stick one

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
Stick on it

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,360
The Japanese ship is full

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,200
You have to chase somebody else Juanzi

64
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,680
You don't pee and look at yourself

65
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Go and go

66
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
Who are you squeezing right

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Squeeze you right

68
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,560
As a brother, have you ever seen a girl robbed by a brother

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,240
I gave it to him

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,800
Dong Zi Dong Zi, he said hey

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
Juanzi was given to you by him

72
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll tell you where you get it

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
I really don't appreciate your affection

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
Don't come and come, Juanzi

75
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,280
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
Be careful I slap you with my big mouth

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
Smoke you with a big mouth

78
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,280
What's wrong? No way

79
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm telling you

80
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,040
You have to be your sixth brother here. I'll take care of you

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,560
Do you know

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,000
What's the matter

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
I'll give you a girl

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Come fat girl

85
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
Come on, come on, come on

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,240
Stick up with your brother Huo and walk

87
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
Good stick, good stick, good stick

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Well-matched, well-matched, well-matched

89
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,760
It's also comfortable

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,080
Jump well. Come on, jump

91
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,360
Comfortable

92
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,880
The wind blows willow leaves fragrant and comfortable

93
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
Xiaomin

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
When I was reading poetry just now,

95
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
You're looking somewhere else

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,640
Why didn't you listen to me

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Hear of it

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,800
Is it

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Maybe I write too many poems

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
I forgot to read it to you

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
Are you hungry

102
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Then I'll treat you to night snack

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,120
What do you want to eat

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Casually

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Casually

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Xinfeng Hefeng Xiaobailou High Steps

107
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
There are too many people

108
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,920
And the drinkers and punchers are too noisy

109
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
The side street in the back

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,160
There is a new food stall of that kind

111
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,760
It's quite quiet

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
Why don't we go there and try it

113
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,920
OK, let's go

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,400
Go

115
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,280
It's not far away

116
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,280
Six sons

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,960
Six sons

118
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,159
What to do

119
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Gap-gap

120
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm coming. It's killing people

121
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,760
Dong Zi, wait for me

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Don't go if you dare

123
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Come on

124
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,840
Fight

125
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,160
Don't run

126
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,960
How many stalls do you see here

127
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,840
This steamed stuffed bun is good

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
I've been very particular about eating

129
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Elder Brother

130
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Xiao Min Wei Min

131
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,920
You two

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
Why are you here

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,760
My brother and his daughter-in-law

134
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I thought I was going back to the city

135
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
There is no place to live at home

136
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
My mother and my grandfather

137
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
Just thinking about being in the courtyard

138
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Give them a small room

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
This is not a lack of money

140
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm off work

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't you set up a stall here

142
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Make some bricks and tiles

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
Then your factory doesn't care

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,480
I earn money by my own craft

145
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,600
I didn't delay my work

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Can they control it

147
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,440
Besides

148
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Now the factory is in recession

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,600
I can't even give out the bonus

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
Is it okay if I don't do this

151
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
OK, then fry two for me

152
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Get it

153
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
Eat here

154
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,520
How poor and dirty his sanitary conditions are

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
That's what I love to eat

156
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Does it hurt

157
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Nothing, nothing, just this little injury

158
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm telling you

159
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,600
Just now, I beat him less

160
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,080
Come out

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Dong Zi Tu Liuzi brought people back again

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,480
Come out

163
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Why are you afraid of knocking with them

164
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Why don't you scatter your girl

165
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
Go, go, go

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
Don't you go

167
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't run, stop, don't go

168
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,040
How does Xiaomin taste

169
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,080
Delicious

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
That's my grandfather. That's the chef

171
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,040
He passed on all my skills to me

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,280
Since Grandma Li left,

173
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,560
I never ate it again

174
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,960
Your grandfather's craftsmanship

175
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,920
Brother Erqiang, you can help me get a plate of garlic juice

176
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,080
You're eating

177
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,320
You said you were a little girl and you were in every family

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,960
Why do you eat so much garlic

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
How delicious it is

180
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,880
Are you old Beijing

181
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,280
Gap

182
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,320
Dong Zi

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,160
Be careful and go quickly

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
Huozi, go quickly

185
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,440
Stop, stop, Dong Zi, don't run

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
Gap, gap, gap

187
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Come on, come on, come on

188
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,400
Dong Zi

189
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,560
Stop and don't run

190
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,400
This Tuliuzi returned the carbine and killed it really quickly

191
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,600
I said Dong Zi

192
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Why do you think he's in such a short time

193
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,160
Call so many people over

194
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,120
I really underestimated him

195
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,880
I remember

196
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,560
When I was at school,

197
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,160
He is also one of our parts

198
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Rat ignorant man leader

199
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,960
I didn't expect to be mixed in the past two years

200
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,760
Dare to challenge me

201
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,120
Those who hand over their teeth break off and those who challenge shake it

202
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,760
Dongzi Plate Brick Service

203
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,560
I said Juanzi

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
You do it one by one

205
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,280
Why is it more ruffian than me

206
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,720
You two went from kindergarten

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,680
Primary and secondary schools

208
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,600
They are all in the same class and have never been separated

209
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,080
You two hang out every day

210
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
You said she was ruffian

211
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
Then she must have learned from you

212
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
What's this called

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,040
This is called black near Mexico

214
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
Don't talk nonsense about you there

215
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,280
Ren Xiaomin grew up with us since childhood

216
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,920
How can people be quiet

217
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,200
It's not at all ruffian

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,040
Dong Zi, then you have to say something you don't like to hear

219
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,320
You have to ask your brother Weimin about this

220
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,440
He is a great talent in our area

221
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,040
Graduated from the Chinese Department of the National People's Congress

222
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,600
Now it's that what

223
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
The editor of Spring Bud Monthly

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Decent literary youth

225
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,040
You said he walked around Xiaomin every day

226
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Then Xiaomin must have been edified by him

227
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,600
What's this called

228
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
This is called near Zhu Zhechi

229
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
You just stop talking nonsense there

230
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
As far as my brother is concerned, he also edifies others

231
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,080
You'd better be careful

232
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
Why am I careful

233
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm telling you

234
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,840
Don't let them get too close

235
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,720
My brother and Xiaomin can't

236
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
How is it impossible to know

237
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,480
Dong Zi

238
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,960
I let you run

239
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
There's no end to it

240
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,960
Walk, walk

241
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
Go, go, go

242
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
Don't run

243
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,640
Come on

244
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,360
Is it enough to eat, Xiaomin

245
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,400
Shall I bring you another plate

246
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,240
Enough already

247
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,720
I did get a message.

248
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,800
Say this tomorrow

249
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,840
The bookstore will sell a batch of world famous works

250
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,920
Really

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
What are the specific masterpieces

252
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,280
The specifics are not clear

253
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
There seems to be some Tolstoy

254
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,440
Hugo's Mo Bosang's

255
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
What Chekhov Hemingway Pushkin

256
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,760
Quite a lot anyway

257
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,520
That's great

258
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,920
I've always wanted to see it

259
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,920
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina

260
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,160
Mo Bosang's "Junyou"

261
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,080
And Hemingway's the Old Man and the Sea

262
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Selected Poems of Pushkin

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,760
I went to Beitu several times, and I didn't borrow it

264
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,280
I must buy it

265
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,520
The news

266
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,000
It is estimated that the 49 cities in Beijing have spread all over the world

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,000
You just want to

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,280
How many literary and artistic youths are holding back to buy it

269
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,120
I reckon the bookstore will open tomorrow

270
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
It's definitely a crazy rush

271
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,600
Let's go, then

272
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Where to go

273
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,560
Go in line

274
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,920
Yeah, too

275
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
If you want to go there tomorrow,

276
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
It is estimated that this book will not be grabbed

277
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Then walk, walk

278
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,600
Elder Brother

279
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,560
Come and settle accounts

280
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,800
It's not for any money

281
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
How much do you say

282
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,960
Isn't that enough

283
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,880
No, keep it

284
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
Yeah, yeah, take it

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Enough already

286
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,080
What do you want to eat later, sister

287
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,760
Come to brother's stall

288
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,560
I'll make it for you

289
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,120
All right

290
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,000
Go away

291
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,040
All right

292
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,560
Walk slowly

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,480
Go, brother

294
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,440
By the way, I'll call the old lady.

295
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,240
This night is not home

296
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm afraid she's worried about me

297
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
Let my aunt tell my mother, too

298
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,520
OK, I'll make a phone call

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,160
Fight

300
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
I said Dong Zi

301
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,599
This Tuliuzi won't touch here, will he

302
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,319
The soil turtle is as poor as a grandson

303
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,520
Eat steamed bread and sesame paste dipped in white sugar

304
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,640
It's all like Chinese New Year

305
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,719
I have to pooled my money to buy it

306
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,238
It's beautiful for him to come here to eat

307
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,640
Gap

308
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,120
You are the light of both of us

309
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
If it weren't for the two of us

310
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,479
Cigarette stalls in the second half of the night

311
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,839
You can do it every three or five times

312
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,679
Come here with us. Peanuts and garlic sausages are draft beer

313
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,920
I said Juanzi

314
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
You have no conscience to say this

315
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:35,280
Who helped you in front of the Friendship Store

316
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,240
Pretending to be a Hong Kong businessman for foreign exchange certificates

317
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm telling you this. Huozi is right

318
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,840
This boy didn't help us change foreign exchange certificates

319
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,960
Flush this

320
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Let me toast you

321
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,880
Come on, come on

322
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,960
You really don't say a gap

323
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,040
You really have those skills

324
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,360
How dare you

325
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,320
I carry a tape every day

326
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
Look at the lyrics and sing Cantonese songs

327
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,560
This song makes me practice

328
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,840
I can't bend my tongue now

329
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,720
Wait a minute, wait a minute

330
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,040
So when you go to school,

331
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
Why didn't I see you work so hard

332
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,760
That's not to help you pretend to be Hong Kong businessmen

333
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,440
Do you want to change foreign exchange certificates

334
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,200
Do you remember

335
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,800
The last time the three of us went to the Friendship Store

336
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,600
Just let people get rid of it

337
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Look at the Hong Kong businessman again

338
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,560
Not even with a block

339
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,680
I made up my mind from that moment on

340
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
Don't you just learn Cantonese

341
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,920
For me,

342
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,920
It's a piece of cake. This is

343
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
You just blow it. You just

344
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Wait a minute

345
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,440
When you were in the alley,

346
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,440
What did you say about Zhu Zhechi

347
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
That's what I mean by saying yes

348
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,720
This Xiaomin is with Brother Weimin every day

349
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,040
It must be the route of literary youth

350
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,200
Don't look at you

351
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,640
Pull Xiaomin every day

352
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
Hanging around with you and Juanzi

353
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,880
You are not the same people at all

354
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Get it

355
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
I remember

356
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
What did Xiaomin say to go with my brother today

357
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
What poetry club in Beihai

358
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
No, I have to find a pay phone

359
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,200
Call my mother and ask if my brother is back.

360
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,960
You eat first

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
I haven't finished my meal yet

362
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,480
Dong Zi

363
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,880
Where can you find a pay phone at night

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
Simpleton

365
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,680
You like Dong Zi

366
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,120
Dong Zi likes Xiaomin

367
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,920
But what about his brother

368
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,440
It is Xiaomin's idol again

369
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,440
If you want me to say it

370
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
You and Dong Zi are short enough

371
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
Eating won't stop your mouth

372
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,840
Aunt aunt aunt

373
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Aunt aunt

374
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,240
It's called mourning

375
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,120
It's not a phone. Use it

376
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
It's urgent at home

377
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
It's very urgent. People are killed

378
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,200
Use the telephone

379
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,000
Five hairs

380
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,880
No, no, don't you usually only have two cents

381
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
Two cents to fight somewhere else

382
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,360
You get five cents, don't you

383
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,160
Wumao Hangxing

384
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,640
Wait a minute

385
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Is it 50 cents

386
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
Thank you. Thank you

387
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,040
Xiaomin, do you want to go to our editorial department

388
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,160
What about going to work

389
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,480
I told our leader

390
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,200
Is it

391
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Yeah

392
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm in our editorial office

393
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
That's more or less a backbone

394
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,160
It carries weight to speak to our leaders

395
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,680
And then what

396
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
The leader listened to my recommendation and welcomed it

397
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,680
Really

398
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,840
Of course

399
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
But yeah

400
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
Come into our editorial office

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
He is principled

402
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
It doesn't mean you have to go to college

403
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,480
But at least you must have the same academic qualifications as this university

404
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,640
Don't worry about it

405
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I've got it all figured out for you

406
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,520
What do you think? I have no chance to go to college

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,360
How can there be no chance

408
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,480
You read so many books, don't you

409
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,920
Have such a good literary foundation

410
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,400
And in this poem

411
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
I also have a lot of my own opinions

412
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
It is not difficult for you to go to college

413
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,760
It's not like I haven't passed the exam before

414
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,200
Too bad at math

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,160
You are a partial subject

416
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,200
You make up for it

417
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
I can make up for it for you

418
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,040
Forget it. As soon as I look at those formula numbers,

419
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,040
My head hurts

420
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,080
Xiaomin, I have to talk about you

421
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,560
You can't back down when you encounter difficulties

422
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,080
How about this

423
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,840
You sign up for the night school

424
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,560
Night diploma

425
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,680
It can be regarded as the equivalent of a university

426
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
Leadership is sure to pass

427
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,120
You say you

428
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,840
A quiet little girl, isn't she

429
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,640
Have ideals and ambitions

430
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,480
With a literary dream

431
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,240
You have to find a way to finish it, don't you

432
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,120
You can't keep following my brother

433
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Those hutong strings are fooling around all day

434
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,720
I know you and my brother grew up

435
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,920
My classmates grew up in small pieces

436
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,640
He has nothing to do with pulling you to pour cigarettes and sell cigarettes

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
You can't grind your noodles, can you

438
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,240
In fact, from the bones,

439
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
You two are not the same people at all

440
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
Look at those people around him

441
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,560
What, Juanzi? Is that like a girl

442
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,680
A whole crazy girl

443
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
And don't mention the gap

444
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,240
I watched him get angry

445
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,200
You stop and don't like to hear it

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
OK, don't say it

447
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,160
Then you think about it. Okay

448
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
Let me know when you're ready

449
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
I'll sign you up

450
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,080
What's the matter

451
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
You drink slowly

452
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,160
Are you crazy

453
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,880
Run the bookstore in line to buy books at night

454
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,280
Isn't it sick

455
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,760
No

456
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,040
You said Brother Weimin and Xiaomin

457
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,480
I went to line up to buy books

458
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,320
My mom told me on the phone just now

459
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,160
That bookstore will have a batch of famous books tomorrow

460
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,800
These two people are like valve cores

461
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,360
Run to the bookstore to queue up to buy books at night

462
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,520
Do you think you are sick?

463
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
Dong Zi, it doesn't make sense for you to say this

464
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,160
You are only allowed to set up cigarette stalls in the middle of the night

465
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
No one is allowed to queue up for books

466
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
Can that be the same

467
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,880
No, I have to find them

468
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,720
Walk, walk

469
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,840
Walk, walk, walk, walk

470
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,400
Dong Zi

471
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
Walk faster

472
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,600
It's a mile in line, isn't it

473
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
Xiaomin came over at night

474
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
It's going to be tomorrow morning

475
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
You can't grab this

476
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,160
That's right

477
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,520
Here we are

478
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,400
Xiaomin, look at it

479
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,040
This is the power of knowledge

480
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,920
This is our generation of young people

481
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,520
A thirst for literature

482
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
With these people,

483
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,040
Our country is bound to be strong

484
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,680
Line up

485
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
Defender

486
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,360
Army building

487
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,600
Long time no see

488
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,440
Long time no see

489
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
This is Xiaomin

490
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,640
Hello, your good friend Jianjun

491
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,680
Sit and sit

492
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,000
Come on, is it appropriate for us to come out? Is it appropriate

493
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,080
What's wrong with it

494
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,760
Come on, come on, Xiaomin, Xiaomin

495
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,280
Army building

496
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,000
Hello, hello, hello

497
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Sit and sit

498
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,440
Hello, hello

499
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,320
First meeting

500
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,240
Dude

501
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
Long time no see

502
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,320
Come on

503
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Nietzsche's ghost has crossed the ocean

504
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,360
Wandering in Asia and ancient Chinese mainland

505
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
Nietzsche said that God is dead

506
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
Every day when I never danced

507
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,280
It's all a disappointment to life

508
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,600
If one knows what one should live for

509
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
He can put up with any kind of life

510
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,400
And

511
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,280
The higher we fly

512
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,720
In the eyes of those who can't fly

513
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,720
We're getting smaller, aren't we

514
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,960
But I still think Sartre's existentialism

515
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,360
It has more practical significance for us

516
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Existence precedes essence

517
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,520
Sartre divided existence into free existence

518
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,160
And self-made existence

519
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,560
What is the existence of oneself

520
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,800
Is the transcendence of self

521
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
If in life

522
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
We can't act according to our own will

523
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
Make a free choice

524
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
Then you lose your personality and self

525
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
It doesn't really exist

526
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,080
This one you two are talking about

527
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,280
Philosophy of Nietzsche and Sartre

528
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
Not as interesting as Freud's

529
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,040
Oh, my god

530
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,680
Why are there so many people

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you crazy

532
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Cut the crap

533
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,920
Find me Xiaomin quickly

534
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
Where is Dong Zi Xiaomin

535
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,400
You have good eyes

536
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,680
Quick, quick, quick

537
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm telling you, Jianjun

538
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,560
You haven't made any progress

539
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,320
You're still so shallow. I'm telling you

540
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,680
Tell me about Nietzsche

541
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,080
Make way

542
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,280
Why are you here if it's not you

543
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,640
The dew is so heavy this night

544
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,400
What should I do if I freeze myself again

545
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,360
Dong Zi, why are you here

546
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,560
I'll buy you a book

547
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,520
What books do you buy

548
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,120
This is a world famous book, not a picture book

549
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,880
You also buy books

550
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
You are allowed to be arty every day

551
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
It's okay to read one book in the east and one book in the west

552
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Cheat the hearts of young literary women

553
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,600
Don't allow me to have something elegant, do you

554
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,480
Lin Weimin

555
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,800
No

556
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,440
It's about you

557
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,280
Why do you talk like a hooligan

558
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,840
Stop

559
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,960
You see, it's so late

560
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Or you go home first

561
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
Let Juanzi go back with you

562
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll line you up here

563
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,600
Can't you come back tomorrow morning

564
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,240
Xiaomin, that's what I just thought

565
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,040
You go back

566
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll, I'll arrange for you

567
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,760
I'll arrange for you

568
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,680
Dui Xiaomin

569
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's go home

570
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,400
At least you can still take a nap

571
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,360
Let these smelly masters line up

572
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Dong Zi is broken

573
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,240
Dong Zi Run

574
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,280
What are you running for

575
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,080
Knocked with them

576
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,520
There it is, there it is, there it is

577
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,320
It's over. This boy is in trouble again

578
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,040
Lin Weimin, you start

579
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
It's none of your business

580
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,080
My brother is going to be beaten

581
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,040
My brother won't stretch out his hand

582
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,120
Am I still a human being

583
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,800
It's kind of interesting

584
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,680
Dong Zi

585
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,080
I'll see where you're going this time

586
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,520
Tu Liuzi, you and Dong Zi

587
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,880
They all grew up together in our alley

588
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,040
How much enmity can there be, isn't it

589
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,960
What kind of society is it now

590
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
You still shout and kill this

591
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,120
We have to talk about civilization

592
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Why is there any reason

593
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,840
There is no problem that cannot be solved, is there

594
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,880
Eldest brother is reasonable

595
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Look at my face. Your brother beat me up

596
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,360
What reason am I talking about? I

597
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,280
I'm telling you, big brother

598
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,440
Get out of my way

599
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,040
Move your hands. Don't hurt you later

600
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,360
I want to swallow this tone

601
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,560
Where else can I put my face?

602
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,160
Dong Zi, I'll spend you

603
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,240
How can I mix outside after my sixth son

604
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,880
Do you know

605
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Cut the crap. You come.

606
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
All right, guys

607
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,920
Give him to me and spend it

608
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,880
Shangshang

609
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute

610
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,480
Wait a minute

611
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,720
Retirement

612
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,360
Retreat

613
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,920
Xiaomin

614
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,360
Your old man is here

615
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,680
It's not Xiaomin

616
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,280
Little ancestor

617
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,600
Look at this. This is between me and Dong Zi

618
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
Can your old man leave it alone

619
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Got it

620
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,520
Understand all

621
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Withdraw

622
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,840
Fuck off

623
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,400
Walk, walk

624
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,280
You ask me who this is

625
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,040
This is the princess in our area

626
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,160
Is the dream lover of our bald boys

627
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,720
It's a quiet girl film

628
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,360
Brother, are you so afraid of her

629
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
Don't even get revenge

630
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Revenge. You still want revenge

631
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
You can take our part

632
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
Self-required ballast frame

633
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,360
The little aunt poked there

634
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,520
Regardless of the big frame and small frame

635
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,480
Just one word and

636
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,320
Really? It's so fantastic

637
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,320
That doesn't look like it

638
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
This is a hooligan in Beijing

639
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,120
You big brothers are so afraid of her

640
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,440
I'm really afraid.

641
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,680
If I dare to mess with her,

642
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,840
When I get home, my mother will have to chop me alive

643
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,880
Then my dad beat me up

644
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,960
If you can't play well, you have to kick me out of the house

645
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Big Brother

646
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,040
What's the matter between your father and your mother

647
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,560
What does it matter to my father and mother

648
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm telling you

649
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
Blow me out of the house. It's all light

650
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,840
Can't play well

651
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,080
Click to sever the father-son relationship

652
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,920
I don't even recognize my big son

653
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Brother, this is too exaggerated

654
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,920
How can I listen

655
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
It's like listening to a story

656
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,560
Who has time to make up stories with you in the middle of the night

657
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,880
Whoever dares to mess with her is eating and twisting

658
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,480
Don't want to live, you know

659
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,640
This time, I'm a fold (failure)

660
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Come on, this thing today

661
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,480
With her covering Dong Zi

662
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
Count Dong Zi, this boy dodged a bullet

663
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Let's just forget it

664
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,880
Big Brother Big Brother

665
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,840
Big brothers have been busy for half a night

666
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,920
I'm hungry now

667
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,200
Be hungry

668
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,840
I don't think you are good at it, do you know

669
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,160
Hangxiaobailou Fried Liver Steamed Bun

670
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:50,880
Get it

671
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
His treat

672
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,840
Good

673
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,240
All the big guys are scattered, are they scattered

674
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,120
Go back to your home and find your mother

675
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,360
Chicken thief you

676
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
The lines are scattered and scattered

677
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,120
Okay, okay, let's go, let's go, let's go

678
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
Xiaomin, you're not going home

679
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,480
You're in such a mess

680
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,000
How can I sleep when I go back

681
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,480
I'm getting bored now

682
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,520
It's so late

683
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
So many people lined up to buy this famous book

684
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,560
Is this famous book that good

685
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,680
What do you know

686
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,960
Do you know

687
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,040
I want to buy this book

688
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,520
I can skip meals for three days

689
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,320
Can you do it

690
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,640
You are not afraid of starving to death

691
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,560
Do you know what spiritual food is

692
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,040
Is it so fantastic

693
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
Is it so fantastic

694
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,400
You don't have eyes. You see for yourself

695
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
The end of the line is two miles away

696
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
Is there anything so evil

697
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,200
Don't sleep

698
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,120
Didn't sleep

699
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,160
You two hurry

700
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,560
Go back to your home and find your mother

701
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,400
Lend me as much money as you have at home

702
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,320
If it's not enough

703
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,840
Just find buddies and sisters to gather together

704
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,760
Anyway, how much money is there before dawn

705
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,800
How much money do you give me

706
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,360
Do you hear me

707
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
Dong Zi, are you taking the wrong medicine? You

708
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,080
Who are you? You borrow money from door to door

709
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,560
There is no rich money in the hands of ordinary people now

710
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,800
You can borrow it if you say so

711
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,800
Can someone lend it to you

712
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,640
What are you talking about? You hurry

713
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
Just say I borrowed it

714
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,520
Get it

715
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Walk

716
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Remember to push our scooter over

717
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
Xiaomin, why don't you ask me to borrow money

718
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:00,920
Xiaomin, why don't you ask me to borrow money

719
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,280
Don't ask

720
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,560
Dong Zi

721
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
You are so early in the morning

722
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,200
What do you need so much money for

723
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,479
Buy books

724
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,040
You can pull it down. You

725
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,639
You also buy books

726
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
The sun rises from the west

727
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
When did you read a book? You

728
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,200
Talk nonsense

729
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,480
Say something sarcastic

730
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,920
I don't care about you. It's interesting to borrow money

731
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
You ask me to borrow money

732
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,239
I don't have any money either

733
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,119
I just have enough money to buy books with Xiaomin

734
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,160
I don't have any spare cash

735
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,279
Brother Wei Min

736
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,279
I asked you to borrow the money

737
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:32,040
I'll pay it back

738
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,640
Not Xiaomin. I-I don't mean that

739
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,039
You don't have to pay us back. Look

740
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,680
To return

741
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,200
Cold and cold

742
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,799
Cold cold cold

743
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,319
How do you manage people to borrow money in the middle of the night

744
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
Everybody's asleep

745
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,839
How to borrow it

746
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,679
Knocking on doors from house to house

747
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,759
Knock on the door

748
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,640
Then you can't be beaten out yet

749
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,440
Look at you like that

750
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,360
These are all old neighborhoods that look up but don't look down

751
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Who will hit you

752
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,200
This Dong Zi thinks of coming out as soon as he comes out

753
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
You have to be scolded if you don't get beaten

754
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,040
Don't you talk about those useless things

755
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,160
Let's hurry

756
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,440
Dong Zi is still waiting

757
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,240
I found out

758
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,160
How come Dong Zi has a word

759
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,040
You are like an imperial edict

760
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Why listen to him so much

761
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,360
You're really right

762
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,240
I'd love to let Dong Zi let me die

763
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,000
You knock

764
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,240
I dare not

765
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,320
Don't sleep, Uncle Chang

766
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,320
Would you please wake up

767
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,600
Who is it

768
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm not dead in the middle of the night

769
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,880
What's the funeral

770
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,640
Grandpa, don't worry

771
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm Juanzi

772
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,000
Juanzi

773
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
These two midnight

774
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Why don't you talk about it tomorrow

775
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
Urgent matter

776
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
No matter how urgent it is

777
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,320
Wait till I wake up tomorrow morning

778
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,040
Xiaomin asked me to borrow some money from you

779
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
About Xiaomin

780
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,840
Wait

781
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,920
Ti Xiaomin really works

782
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,360
Don't worry, take your time

783
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
Walk, walk

784
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
One by one, one by one

785
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,520
Don't worry, take your time

786
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,600
Get in line

787
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
Come on, come on, come on

788
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,520
Step back and come one by one

789
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,080
Don't worry, don't worry

790
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,000
Dong Zi Dong Zi

791
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,120
Come on, come on

792
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,840
Hurry up, hurry up

793
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,920
Don't worry, don't worry

794
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
We're not late, are we

795
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,720
Qian Qian, hurry up

796
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,400
This knocks on doors from house to house to borrow money from others

797
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,360
This is the first time

798
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,200
We all borrowed it. It's all here

799
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,240
Xiaomin really has a face

800
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,400
When it comes to borrowing

801
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,600
Don't knock

802
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
How much money does the family have to pay out

803
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,320
That's if you don't look at our Xiaomin

804
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
What are you talking about

805
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,680
When did this Xiaomin become your family's

806
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,120
So what's the matter

807
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,000
It's not ours or yours

808
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm telling you

809
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,680
Xiaomin is my girlfriend

810
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,760
Of course it's our family

811
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,440
No, no, no

812
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,440
Aren't you two a family

813
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,880
My own brother

814
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,760
It's not Huozi. What can I do for you

815
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,960
What's wrong with you

816
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Dong Zi, let me tell you something

817
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,520
Xiaomin never promised to be your girlfriend

818
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,600
Don't be wishful thinking

819
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,440
That is

820
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,320
Let me tell you something

821
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
Xiaomin didn't say it

822
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
But I have me in my heart, understand

823
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,680
Stop your bullshit

824
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,720
Go away

825
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,560
Quick and quick

826
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,880
Walk, walk

827
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,240
Is that all right

828
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,360
Line line line

829
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,720
Hello, I want Anna Karenina.

830
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,000
Don't squeeze "The Old Man and the Sea" and "Junyou"

831
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Don't squeeze

832
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
Don't squeeze here

833
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,320
Mo Bosang's "handsome friends" are gone

834
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Comrades, comrades, Hugo's Les Miserables

835
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,800
Is there Stendhal's Red and Black

836
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,480
Yes, yes

837
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
Give me "Selected Poems of Pushkin" again

838
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,840
Good

839
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Don't squeeze

840
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,720
Give it to me give it to me

841
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
I'll pay the money

842
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,160
Come on, step aside, step aside

843
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,080
Come and make way

844
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,800
What about here? What about here

Don't move, don't move

847
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,960
But with this money

848
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,640
Give me two sets of each famous book

849
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:27,920
Good

850
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,240
What are you looking at

851
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,560
What's there to see

852
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,640
Haven't you seen a cultural youth who loves books like life

853
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,040
Cattle

854
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
Don't worry, don't worry

855
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,720
Don't worry

856
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,360
Come on, come on. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me

857
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,720
The last box

Good

859
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,760
Why don't you hurry home and go to bed

860
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,880
I haven't slept all night

861
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,560
Then what are you going to do

862
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,280
You don't care what I do

863
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,760
Go, go, go

864
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,600

Excuse me. Excuse me

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
Smelly boy plays mystery all day

868
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,200
I guess I didn't suppress any good things

869
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,400
Let's go

870
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,040
Let me hold it for you

871
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,800
Thank you, Brother Weimin

872
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,440
Not bad. It's fine today

873
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,520
It's good, it's good, it's good

What does Dong Zi mean

876
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,320
Fell asleep

877
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,920
Last night, our brothers waited for you half the night

878
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,040
Didn't show up

879
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,960
Yeah, Dong Zi

880
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,960
Every time this first stand should be yours

881
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,080
Don't ask

882
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,720
I must have dreamed of a beautiful woman last night

883
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,920
I didn't get up.

884
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,160
I haven't got up today

885
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
Guys

886
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,040
Don't gloat

887
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,560
Today, Brother Dong, I am kind

888
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,640
Let you guys

889
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,760
You said this is normal

890
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm always here

891
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,920
Business is the best

892
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,040
Every time I look at you

893
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,360
Do you charge it two or three hours later than me

894
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,640
I can't bear it in my heart

895
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
Fighting righteousness

896
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,960
This good experience will be more frequent in the future

897
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,960
No problem

898

Dong Zi

899
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,840
Why don't you practice smoking and books today

900
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,680
You said how vulgar it is to practice smoking

901
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,360
Spiritual food

902
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,920

903
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,280
