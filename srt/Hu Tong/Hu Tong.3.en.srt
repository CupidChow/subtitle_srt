1
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
After the peaceful liberation of Beiping,

2
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,000
The outstanding problems in public security are

3
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,840
More spies, more robbers

4
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,520
There are many stragglers and thieves

5
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,440
Lurking enemy agents and bandits are often found

6
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
Burying mines and shooting cold guns

7
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Carry out subversive and sabotage activities

8
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,240
Robbery, murder, poisoning and arson

9
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Malignant cases such as these occur frequently

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,280
The social order is very chaotic

11
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,920
The situation is very serious

12
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,640
Comrades

13
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
In a few months

14
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,480
Our founding ceremony is about to be held

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,080
The task given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao is

16
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Quickly rectify law and order

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,640
Eliminate enemy agents and wandering bandits

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,760
And all reactionary organizations such as reactionary secret societies

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,120
Ensure the smooth holding of founding ceremony

20
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
I know

21
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,040
New city

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
We are completely blind

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
It is difficult to carry out the work

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
But you have to remember

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,720
The people are our strong backing

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,320
We should mobilize the broad masses of the people

27
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,600
Into the torrent of revolution

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,320
Let the vast sea of the people

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,320
To annihilate all reactionaries

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Water can carry a boat

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,680
Just mobilize the masses

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
Our New China

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
I will be able to really stand up

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Why are you here so late

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,120
Why are you here so late

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Have you eaten

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,840
Not really

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,160
I knew you didn't eat

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,000
Send you some night snack

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,800
You said it's so late why don't you go to bed

41
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,600
Work is so busy

42
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,920
I don't have time to sleep

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,920
Pay attention to your health when you are busy with your work

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,400
You're not made of iron

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,600
You're talking about me

46
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Am I at least a big master

47
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,840
You should pay more attention to your health

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Eat it while it's hot

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,160
Let's go to my dormitory and eat together

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,160
I won't go at this late hour

51
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,120
You said it would be bad for them to see me again

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
What's the relationship between us

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Who doesn't know

54
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,320
What are you afraid of

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
What am I afraid of

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
What's there to be afraid of

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,880
Let's take a walk, then

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Director, director

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,560
Director

60
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,399
What's the matter

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
I knew it was here with Sister Red Tassel

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm sure I'll find you

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,399
Something happened

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
When did he die

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
According to the nurse on duty,

66
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,240
He was fine at dinner

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,840
He died when he changed his dressing at night

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
How did you die

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,440
Report to the Director

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
The exact cause of death is not yet clear

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
Awaiting a forensic autopsy

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,480
When will the forensic doctor arrive

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,520
On the way

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Inform Qin Defu to arrive at the scene immediately

75
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Yes

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Chief, you come with me

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
There's another one over here

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,000
And

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
The wheelchair slipped down the stairs

80
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
The wounded man hit his head

81
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,120
Bleeding excessively

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Is dead now

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
What's going on

84
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Was there no one around him at that time

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,880
I don't know

86
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Our hospital

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,560
Requisitioned by the People's Liberation Army as a hospital for the wounded

88
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,120
All the wounded in the siege of Tianjin battlefield

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Come to us for healing

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,400
We are already short-handed

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,240
I really can't see it

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
These soldiers were all wounded in battle

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
Is our hero

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Didn't die on the battlefield

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
Died in hospital

96
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
How do you want me to tell their troops

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
Parents and comrades confessed

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,440
Make a thorough investigation

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,760
The wounded man who fell to his death in a wheelchair

100
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Must have been pushed down

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,560
I think your conclusion is a bit too arbitrary

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,360
Is it possible that he accidentally fell

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
If he accidentally fell,

104
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,160
What about the wounded man who died in the ward

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
His injuries are very serious

106
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
It could be a heart attack

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,920
Or cause other emergencies

108
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,960
There are many reasons that can lead to death

109
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,280
Come on, come on, don't argue

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Wait for the autopsy report

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Report

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Advance

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,720
According to this autopsy report

114
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
The wounded in the hospital bed died of suffocation

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
There is no other cause

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,320
So now it's pretty certain that he was suffocated

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,960
That is to say, in our hospital

118
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,640
There are lurking agents doing assassinations

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
No way

120
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,360
After our hospital was requisitioned by the army,

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,840
Military control was carried out

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
People's Liberation Army stands guard everywhere

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
It is impossible for outsiders to come in

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
And this place is full of officers and men of the army

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
I have never treated foreign patients

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,360
Where did the spies come from

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
You're not suspecting

128
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,720
The staff of our hospital

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Is there a problem

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,320
You can't rule out this possibility

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
If there is a spy assassination,

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,280
I have a problem to report to the leader

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
You said

134
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,160
A wounded man died two days ago

135
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Because no problems were detected

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,440
We'll treat it as a normal death

137
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,720
Where is the body

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,320
Waiting for the families of the deceased to come from other places for autopsy

139
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,600
So the body is still in the morgue

140
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,720
Do an autopsy at once

141
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,400
My sister Chun Xi is to treat her mother

142
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
To sell myself here

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
She has made you a lot of money

144
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,720
Why would you let her brother not see her?

145
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,600
With what

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
Just because she's mine

147
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,240
I said let's see before we can see

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,040
I said you can't see if you don't let me see

149
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,440
This is a new society

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,320
The common people are the masters of the country

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,920
You won't let me see you again, will you

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
I'll ask the government to take care of you

153
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,640
You know about the government in this little girl film, you

154
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,160
My mother opens the door to do business

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
The government can't control me when it comes

156
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,200
You tell me again

157
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,880
What's the matter

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
Besides, the government can't control you

159
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm done. What do you think

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,080
You, you hurry

161
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Call out Sister Chunxi for me

162
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,679
We want to see Sister Chunxi

163
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,240
Sister Chun Xi

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
We want to see Sister Chunxi

165
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Come out

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
We want to see Sister Chunxi

167
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,720
Sister Chunxi

168
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
Coal core

169
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,040
Coal core sister

170
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,960
What to do

171
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,240
What are you doing

172
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,880
Upper

173
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,760
Elder sister

174
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Get off you for me

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Elder sister

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
Mom, I haven't seen my brother for half a year

177
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,000
Just be kind

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Let me have dinner with my brother

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
We'll be back as soon as we finish eating

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
It will never delay the business at night

181
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Walk back and forth

182
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,120
Elder sister

183
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,880
Coal core sister

184
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Jujube

185
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
Eat first

186
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
Have another plate later

187
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you, your uncle

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
Eat slowly and don't choke

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,080
Sister, you also eat

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm not hungry. Eat more

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
Coal core

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,960
I haven't seen your sister for so long

193
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't you talk to your sister a little longer

194
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,640
Spend on eating

195
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
Getting more and more distinguished

196
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
Sister Chunxi, don't say that

197
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,520
Coal core always talks about you. He misses you

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,480
Right

199
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,400
The coal core has grown taller and stronger

200
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
Jujube

201
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,840
Look at him now

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,120
I really don't know how to thank you

203
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,960
Elder sister

204
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
It would be too outlandish for you to say thank you to me

205
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,680
We grew up in the same alley

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
My parents left early

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
When I became an orphan,

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Aunt didn't help me less

209
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Aunt is ill

210
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
You want to raise money for her

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
I couldn't help but go to a place like that

212
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
Then the aunt left

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
Leave the coal core alone

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
I don't take care of him. Who takes care of him

215
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Our lives are too bitter

216
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,040
Yes

217
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
Our lives are very bitter

218
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,080
But it's different now

219
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,680
The Communist Party has been liberated

220
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
Sister, do you know

221
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
I recognized a sister in the Communist Party

222
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,120
What a nice person

223
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
That smelly pimp will bully you again in the future

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,320
I'll lead you to her

225
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,160
She's sure to help you

226
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
How about that

227
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,160
How about that

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
You eat too

229
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
You also eat some

230
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,280
It's not right

231
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Any problems

232
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,200
This kind of patient is in his body

233
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
How can there be aconitine residue

234
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,400
Aconitine. What's that

235
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
Aconitine is a highly toxic alkaloid

236
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,960
After the solution is injected into human body,

237
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Will be absorbed through digestive tract and mucosa

238
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,960
Will cause nerve endings and the central nervous system

239
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Excitement, then inhibition and paralysis

240
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,280
Finally, due to breathing asphyxia

241
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,640
Rapid death due to heart paralysis and heart failure

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
If you don't do an autopsy,

243
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,240
You won't find any traces

244
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,040
Then he was poisoned

245
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
It can be said that

246
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,920
Dean Qin

247
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,640
It is now certain that

248
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,680
The wounded were assassinated by secret agents

249
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
We're going to be right now

250
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,400
All the staff of the hospital

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,560
Conduct a screening

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,200
Find out the murderer

253
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,400
But

254
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
This matter is a top secret

255
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,520
Only a few people in our house know

256
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
Including this screening

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,680
It should also be done in secret

258
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,680
Never startle the snake

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,360
Understand

260
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
Let me see

261
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
Not completely unnoticed

262
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,440
Was there anyone at the scene

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you sure

264
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Have you observed them carefully

265
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,840
Is Aunt at home

266
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,120
Xiulan

267
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,160
Sister Xiulan

268
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,360
What did all these people do at noon

269
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,360
Out

270
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,640
Out

271
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
I knocked on the door

272
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Be thirsty

273
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,840
I said Suo Ye

274
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,880
Your ancestors are an out-and-out blue flag

275
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,000
That is a scholarly family and an official family

276
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,040
How did you get here

277
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,160
I don't have any rules.

278
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,160
Stop

279
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Don't tell me about my ancestors

280
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,480
I can't afford to lose that man

281
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,840
You also know how to have a face

282
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,960
Do you see how I have become down and out

283
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,520
There is no face

284
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,480
Rules, who are our brothers with whom?

285
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,840
If I tell you the rules,

286
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,960
Doesn't that reveal identity

287
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,240
What are you churning about

288
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,200
I haven't chewed the grain all morning

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,640
If you have anything to eat, make up for it for me

290
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Suo Ye

291
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,240
I've never seen anything like you before

292
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
Don't treat yourself as an outsider

293
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,400
I have eaten lunch this morning

294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,760
I didn't keep it for you

295
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Do you still have some melon seeds to eat

296
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,960
Give me that word

297
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,160
Have some melon seeds to make up for it

298
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
Can also

299
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,320
Up to the time of power generation

300
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,200
Most of the armies on our east road have crossed the south bank

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,240
The rest can be completed in 23 days

302
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
The enemy resistance is tenacious here

303
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,440
But on the afternoon of the 21st

304
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,480
In the fierce fighting all day on the afternoon of the 22nd,

305
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,480
Our army has annihilated and defeated all the enemies who resisted

306
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,360
Occupy Yangzhong Zhenjiang

307
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,040
The vast areas of Jiangyin counties

308
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,880
And control Jiangyin Fortress

309
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,440
Blockade the Yangtze River

310
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,040
I said old boy

311
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,480
You said that the Kuomintang couldn't help fighting

312
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
It's only been a few days

313
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,480
This natural barrier of the Yangtze River is over

314
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,359
Millions of heroes cross the great river like a broken bamboo

315
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,000
Suo Ye

316
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,599
Live here for a few days

317
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,800
Nanjing is about to be liberated

318
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,760
This Communist Party is also very powerful

319
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
It's fine.

320
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,520
Elder sister

321
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,760
Coal core

322
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,880
Elder sister

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Elder sister

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,560
Sister Chunxi, you'd better hurry back

325
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,280
Otherwise, the smelly pimp should bully you again

326
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,800
Listen to your sister Zao

327
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,000
Say goodbye to your sister

328
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,600
Don't feel bad about coal core

329
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll bring you back to see your sister later

330
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,600
How long

331
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
Just after a while

332
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,600
Can I take you shopping

333
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,080
And I have no money to buy something delicious

334
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,120
What's so exciting about shopping

335
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,120
You smelly coal core

336
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,160
I just ate my tripe and I'm hungry again

337
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,760
This hungry ghost

338
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,240
Then take me to see Brother Iron Egg practice wrestling

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,720
That line

340
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Just don't have to spend money

341
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,360
Go away

342
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
Cloud hand, cloud hand

343
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,520
Stand firm with one's feet

344
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,960
Come again, come again, come again

345
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,760
Small sleeve and large collar

346
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,600
Teacher Niang

347
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Teacher Niang Teacher Niang

348
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,800
What are you talking nonsense about

349
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,520
Call elder sister

350
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
Elder sister

351
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,440
That's about the same

352
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Jujube sister shows her hands

353
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,640
Just you guys

354
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,680
It's not enough for me to fall

355
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,240
Jujube sister and my master practice two hands

356
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
He is even less a man

357
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,600
Why are you blind?

358
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,840
You guys

359
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,360
Practice well with coal core

360
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Let me have a word with your jujube sister

361
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Jujube

362
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,040
I haven't seen you for a few days. What are you busy with

363
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,360
Busy with what, busy with business

364
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
What business can you do

365
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Smelly iron eggs look down on people, don't they

366
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm telling you

367
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,920
Now the street government of Sister Hong Ying

368
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Mass activists are being vigorously developed

369
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,400
Working for the government

370
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,160
Yeah

371
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,240
Those who stayed behind really couldn't use it

372
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,520
It's time for a change of people

373
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,560
It's not that I said this. You didn't understand

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
Understand what

375
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Iron egg

376
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
A young man of your age

377
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,440
I practice boxing and wrestling every day

378
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,960
Don't do something serious

379
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,520
Preaching, teaching and teaching apprentices well

380
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,120
This is the business

381
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
How can I say you

382
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,680
You have such a good skill

383
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
You should be like Yue Fei

384
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,880
Serve the country faithfully

385
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,360
What do you mean

386
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,520
Want me to work for the Communist Party

387
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,920
I finally heard it

388
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll tell you iron eggs

389
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,800
The Communist Party avenged me for killing my father

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,840
And I follow Sister Hongying every day these days

391
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,920
I look at these people

392
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,040
Is it really doing practical things for the people

393
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
So I decided

394
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,720
I want to join them

395
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
Be an activist

396
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,760
It's not just me

397
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
You have to join in

398
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Jujube

399
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,280
You think about it too easily

400
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,520
Then the Communist Party said that if you join, you can join

401
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,520
That can't be collected by individuals

402
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,280
Regardless of whether he accepts it or not

403
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,920
I'll fight for it anyway

404
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,240
You did fight for it

405
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,160
You follow people all day

406
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Red tassel sister turns behind her ass

407
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,360
Did they accept you

408
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,640
No

409
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
But I believe

410
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
Will accept me sooner or later

411
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,360
Yes, I believe you, too

412
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,480
So here's the deal

413
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,320
You can develop me when you join the party

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
It can really work. That's it

415
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
After all this time

416
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Our secret investigation of the hospital

417
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,320
Found an important clue

418
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,840
There is a female nurse named Zhou Ping

419
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,600
It appeared several times at the time of the crime

420
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,360
But she wasn't on duty at that time

421
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Director Lin relies on this clue

422
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,000
We can't be sure that she is a spy.

423
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
Old Qin, you are right

424
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
What about us now

425
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,560
Let's just say she's a suspect

426
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,680
At present, we have to do two things

427
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,360
A red tassel

428
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
According to our investigation

429
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,640
This Zhou Ping lives in

430
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
The alley of your segment

431
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,680
Your street government is going to provide us with

432
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,000
This household survey

433
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,120
All the details about Zhou Ping

434
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,760
Good

435
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,840
I'll pull up her information as soon as I get back

436
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,600
Dapeng starts from now on

437
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,880
A 24-hour visit to Zhou Ping

438
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,440
All-round surveillance

439
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,160
Where does she go every day

440
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,040
What contact do you have with someone

441
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,160
Be sure to find out

442
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
Never miss any clues

443
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes

444
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,800
In view of the present

445
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,200
The present situation is very complicated

446
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,480
Our surveillance of this Zhou Ping

447
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
It must be done in secret

448
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,080
So only a few of us know

449
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,360
It must not spread

450
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,480
Qin Kechang

451
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,120
Be sure to pay attention to organizational discipline

452
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,520
Secrecy

453
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,360
Director Lin, you don't have to remind me

454
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,480
I'm an old cop, too

455
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,080
I understand this discretion

456
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
This is all the household registration information of Zhou Ping

457
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,960
Old Qin Zhou Ping's household registration is Handan, Hebei Province

458
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
You work hard to make an external tune

459
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
What's the hard work

460
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I am now the head of the household registration department of the branch office

461
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,880
That's what I did

462
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,680
I'll pack up and start right away

463
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,760
The director followed Zhou Ping for less than half a month

464
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,120
Nothing unusual was found

465
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,520
This Zhou Ping either goes to work

466
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Eat out after work

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Go to the Rouge Shop

468
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,080
And made clothes twice

469
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,720
And I've heard three plays

470
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,120
She is alone

471
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,240
Live in a small miscellaneous hospital

472
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,600
One household

473
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,280
It's a rickshaw puller

474
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,440
There is also a small business

475
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,760
They didn't find anything unusual in Zhou Ping either

476
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Then during this time,

477
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,480
Who did she come into contact with

478
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,320
In addition to colleagues in the unit,

479
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,240
It is some running halls that I come into contact with in my life

480
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,080
There are shops and theaters

481
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,240
We looked into it

482
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,080
These people are all

483
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,840
Ordinary people who have lived here for a long time

484
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,800
It's not a suspicious person

485
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
How come you haven't recorded these three hours

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
Where did she go

487
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
I lost those three hours

488
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,280
Lost him

489
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,520
Dapeng

490
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,680
You are also an old scout

491
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,160
How can you lose track of someone

492
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,120
What are you doing to eat

493
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,320
Director

494
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,680
This Zhou Ping strolls around if he has nothing to do

495
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,120
There are many people and miscellaneous cars in this street

496
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,960
We've been following for so long

497
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,720
It's normal to lose once

498
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,080
Besides, the time is not long

499
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
Just three or four hours

500
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,840
Just three or four hours

501
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,440
Three or four hours

502
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,320
She could have made contact with her superiors

503
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,800
She could kill someone in three or four hours, you know

504
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
It's not that serious, is it

505
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,680
How did you lose it? Say it quickly

506
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,080
Let me see

507
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,160
Director Lin, I'm back

508
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,880
Hard work

509
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
It's not hard. This is what I should do

510
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,160
Director Lin

511
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
Provided by Comrade Li Hongying

512
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,800
Zhou Ping's household registration materials are wrong

513
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,560
I went to the local area to do a survey according to the household registration materials

514
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,640
The local government said

515
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,160
There is no such person at all

516
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,120
How do you say

517
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,160
It shows that this household registration material is fake

518
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Such a big spy murder case

519
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,080
Our superiors strictly ordered us to solve the case within a time limit

520
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
Now less than half a month is almost over

521
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
There is no clue at all

522
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,400
Even this household registration information is false

523
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,680
How do you say you do this job

524
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,800
I said Lin Zheng

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,440
Don't get mad at us

526
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,320
Household registration survey

527
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,960
It's your police station and our street government

528
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Carried out in one piece

529
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
To say there is responsibility

530
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
That's not the responsibility of our street government

531
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,360
Besides

532
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,560
When investigating,

533
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
That's what Zhou Ping said herself

534
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
We made the registration according to the materials provided by her

535
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,600
She doesn't tell the truth

536
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,280
We don't know whether it's true or not

537
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay

538
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,320
Now is not the time to pass the buck

539
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,000
In this way

540
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,600
Red tassel

541
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
You take people yourself

542
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,920
Visit the neighbors around Zhou Ping

543
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,360
Do another detailed investigation

544
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,360
But remember

545
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,160
Don't disturb Zhou Ping

546
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,640
This goal of our police is too big

547
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,760
So what about this matter

548
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,680
Give it to your street government

549
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,960
OK, let's leave it to us

550
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,800
The boss looks good

551
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,600
Xiulan

552
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,040
You work for your mother at home all day

553
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,760
Don't go to private school

554
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,560
Let me tell you something

555
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,560
As far as the old pedant in our private school is concerned

556
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,520
Then he will know how to shake his head all day

557
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
It's not interesting at all

558
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,600
I want to discuss it with my dad

559
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,360
Send me to a girls' school or something then

560
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Girls' school

561
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,560
What

562
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,360
What girls' school does every family go to?

563
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Just read some private schools and write

564
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,160
Forget it. Forget it. I won't tell you

565
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,360
It's nothing to tell you

566
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,320
Taste enough

567
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,520
Fourth Brother

568
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,640
Let me tell you something

569
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,240
You are so soft

570
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
That sounds really bad

571
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
You have one of that what

572
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,280
Liang Hongyu Rolls Drums and Fights Jinshan

573
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,960
This sounds great. You have one of these

574
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,720
All right

575
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,760
Boss

576
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,600
You mustn't listen to this smelly girl

577
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,000
What does she know about drama

578
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
Full of a wooden stick

579
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,680
This "drunken imperial concubine"

580
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,640
That's the boy boss's specialty

581
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,880
Authentic Erhuang small door opening

582
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
Liang Hongyu Rolls Drums and Fights Jinshan

583
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
That depends on Boss Shang

584
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
Besides

585
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,240
Boss Tong's job is Tsing Yi

586
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,560
Fighting Jinshan is Peking Opera blues's job

587
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,040
It's not a door

588
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,160
Do you understand

589
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,280
Upper eye

590
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,720
My goose bumps

591
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,800
Stop it, stop it

592
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,720
Come on, come on, come on

593
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
You are so deserted that you walk away from the board

594
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,400
Don't take me away

595
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,720
That can't

596
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,760
Jujube

597
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,680
They're all here

598
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Comrade Li

599
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,040
Red Tassel Sister

600
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
You came to our hospital today

601
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,160
I'm not coming to develop. I'm coming

602
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm telling you

603
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm all ready

604
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,880
You can enter the work at any time

605
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,480
Xiaozao, don't worry

606
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,240
Come today

607
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,920
Is looking for you old neighbors

608
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,200
Learn something

609
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,760
Know what you said

610
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Dapeng

611
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,920
You don't remember how you lost it

612
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,040
I remember

613
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,560
Zhou Ping seemed to have a rest and didn't go to work that day

614
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
She took to the streets after lunch

615
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,400
Then we followed her

616
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,360
She went out of the alley and onto a side street

617
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,600
We followed two steps closely

618
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,720
She's gone

619
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,840
What side street

620
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,880
Cigarette bag slant street

621
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
Director Lin, I know this street

622
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,080
There are shops on both sides

623
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
It's our piece

624
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,400
A very busy downtown street

625
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Go over and have a look

626
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes

627
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,760
Handan

628
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Zhou Ping is not from Handan

629
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
How do you know

630
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,040
She is from Jingxian County, Hengshui, Hebei Province

631
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,720
Don't talk nonsense, Jujube

632
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
Where is she from? Even the government doesn't know

633
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,120
How can you know

634
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,360
Aunt, you don't know

635
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,200
I was chatting with Sister Ping in the courtyard that day

636
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
A sparrow just shit on the top of his head

637
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
Pull it on her dress

638
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
Later, when Sister Ping was driving sparrows,

639
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
While calling the sparrow Lao Dang

640
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,120
Later, I said, "What does it mean to be old?"

641
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,280
Sister Ping said that in her hometown

642
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,040
If you call a sparrow, you will call it an old man

643
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,920
Then I asked her where your hometown is

644
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,000
She didn't say

645
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,080
Then I put this matter

646
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,440
Tell jokes to those children

647
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,240
When I talk about sparrows, they are old

648
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Dayong said

649
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,920
He also called this old sparrow in his hometown

650
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,560
Dayong's hometown is Jingxian County, Hengshui, Hebei Province

651
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,840
That's why I dare to say that Zhou Ping is from Jingxian County

652
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,640
Get it

653
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,560
Jujube

654
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,360
Scared me a lot

655
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,080
You really helped me a lot

656
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,200
I've been busy here for several days

657
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm almost desperate

658
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,120
This sentence of yours

659
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,720
Solved all my problems

660
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,080
That helps

661
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,320
Elder sister

662
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,520
There's a lot I can do for you

663
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,960
Can you develop me quickly

664
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,800
The child has his nose on his face

665
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
Not sister

666
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,520
What are you doing investigating Zhou Ping

667
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
So what happened a while ago

668
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,720
Isn't it a household check account

669
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,080
Right

670
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,760
Now the government is doing the household registration survey

671
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,040
It's not just Zhou Ping

672
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,840
There are several households in our area

673
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,200
Incomplete registration

674
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,160
Isn't this further verification

675
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,280
Chief, so many stores

676
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't know which one she went to

677
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Besides

678
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,840
You said that the scout of the ox

679
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,760
I have never encountered such complicated terrain

680
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,880
Dapeng, let me ask you something

681
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,040
After she turned into this street,

682
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,200
Have you been watching over her

683
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,520
I've been watching

684
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,440
She never showed up again

685
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
Then when you find her again,

686
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,599
Where is she

687
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
The man who stared at her house told me that she had gone home

688
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,360
Go back

689
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,559
This information provided by Tian Zao is very important

690
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,520
Old Qin

691
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,960
I have to trouble you to make another hard trip

692
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,079
Don't worry, Director Lin

693
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll leave early tomorrow morning

694
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,280
In addition, according to Dapeng

695
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,119
Secret surveillance of this Zhou Ping

696
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,840
Although we can't be sure now,

697
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,200
Zhou Ping is a spy

698
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
But she must be a suspect

699
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,200
Especially her

700
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,880
Three hours of mysterious disappearance

701
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,720
So I have a bold idea

702
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,800
In the shops on this cigarette bag street,

703
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,559
There must be a contact point for her

704
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,920
It's possible that she's on the line

705
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,960
It may also be her receiver

706
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,000
Cover her out of our sight

707
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,680
Director Lin, you mean these shops

708
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,560
There are secret passages or back doors or something like that

709
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,400
Where does Zhou Ping leave this time

710
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,680
I went to another place again

711
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
That's for sure

712
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,160
Otherwise, she must have entered from some shop

713
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,360
Which store will you come out of again

714
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
We've been guarding her

715
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,240
When I saw her again,

716
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,240
She's already home

717
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,440
So I think it is necessary for us now

718
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,400
Conduct a secret investigation of this shop

719
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,160
First, look at this shop

720
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,480
Is there anyone suspicious

721
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,920
The second is to look at this store

722
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,640
Is there a secret passage

723
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,400
Or the back door or something

724
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,960
But there's so much noise going door to door

725
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
You're not afraid to startle

726
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
So we have to think of one now

727
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,960
Justifiable reasons

728
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Director Lin, if you say so,

729
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I think fire investigation and fire prevention

730
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
This reason is the most legitimate

731
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Old Qin, you have a good idea

732
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
That's it

733
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,120
In the name of fire fighting

734
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,200
To this cigarette bag, every shop in the oblique street

735
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,480
Conduct a major fire safety inspection

736
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,560
Dapeng

737
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,280
You send someone to the fire brigade

738
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,200
Tell them to send someone

739
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,920
You are in their capacity

740
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,400
Conduct a fire inspection of this shop

741
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
Let's act tomorrow

742
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,280
Yes

743
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480
Another red tassel

744
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,640
Your street government will help us read it again

745
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
Household registration information

746
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,200
Check the identity background of the shop owner

747
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,120
See if they have any suspicious people

748
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,880
Good

749
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Check every place well

750
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,960
Two over here

751
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,640
This way

752
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,080
Please excuse me

753
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,040
Understanding understanding understanding understanding

754
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
Sir, you are lucky

755
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,360
Check fire control

756
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
You please you please

757
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,680
Everybody pay attention

758
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,000
Things here are precious

759
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,360
We can't afford to lose it if we touch it

760
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,680
Keep your hands down

761
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Yes yes

762
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,560
Thank you, sir.

763
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,760
On a hot day

764
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,440
You sit here and have a sip of water and rest your feet

765
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,160
Avoid

766
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,960
If you drink it from house to house,

767
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,200
When will you have to drink it?

768
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,240
You have worked hard

769
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,920
Boss

770
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,800
Trouble

771
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,360
You work hard, you work hard

772
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,680
Go to the next house, brothers

773
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:44,800
Go to the next house, brothers

774
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Sir, walk slowly

775
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,440
The captain didn't find a suspicious target

776
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,960
No

777
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,840
Captain, we didn't find anything here

778
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
Go over there and have a look

779
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,720
The boss has worked hard

780
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,560
Hard work, hard work

781
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,480
What's hard work? Hard luck

782
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,520
You mean this hot day

783
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,320
We still have to give you

784
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
These business jobs

785
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,640
Dry weather and dry things

786
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,200
Easy to cause fire

787
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,440
Understanding understanding

788
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,240
That's right

789
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,200
Some time ago, Luomashi Street

790
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,640
There is a fire in a shop

791
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,280
The whole street is burning

792
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,600
The connected shops have burned to the bottom

793
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,520
This is not an order from the superior

794
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,400
All regions must be strictly investigated

795
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:38,920
Check

796
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
By the way, you sit down

797
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,920
Sit and sit

798
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,600
The coming of a hot day

799
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,160
Have a cup of tea

800
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,760
Tea will be avoided

801
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,720
Tea will be avoided

802
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,920
Safety

803
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,800
Safety

804
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,720
Safety

805
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,880
Boss

806
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,640
You are quite complete

807
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,240
Suit, coat and cheongsam

808
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Have everything

809
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,720
Sir

810
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,480
You can't move here

811
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,280
What's the matter

812
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,920
What can't be touched here

813
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,960
This is tailor-made for our customers

814
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,360
They are all made of fine clothes

815
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,720
Gold is very expensive

816
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,160
If you get dirty,

817
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,600
How do you say we tell other people's customers

818
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,800
As for? Boss

819
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
Just a few clothes

820
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,280
I'd like to see what's valuable

821
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,960
This, this

822
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,640
Not bad

823
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,600
This craft is good

824
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,160
Thank you for your compliment

825
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,920
In the future, if you want to make clothes, come to me

826
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,200
That will give you the best material for sure

827
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,840
Get get

828
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,160
I can't afford your clothes

829
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,240
Excuse me, boss

830
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:14,800
Go

831
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,400
Walk slowly, walk slowly, walk slowly

832
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
Walk slowly

833
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,520
We checked for a few days

834
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,480
Check all the shops

835
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,840
I didn't find any clues

836
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,800
The spy is very cunning

837
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,560
Clues are not so easy to find

838
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,920
Just tell me which shop is suspicious

839
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,280
If you want to say suspicious, it is the ready-to-wear shop

840
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,960
Why is it suspicious

841
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,920
That ready-to-wear shop has a wall

842
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,160
They are all glass cabinets full of clothes

843
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,200
What's suspicious about this

844
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,840
Isn't it normal for the ready-to-wear shop to have a wardrobe

845
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,840
But that cabinet is too big

846
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,280
There are all kinds of things hanging inside

847
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,360
High-grade clothing

848
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,760
When I checked, the boss stopped me from checking

849
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,880
It is said that they are all custom-made clothes

850
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,920
I'm afraid I'll get dirty

851
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,960
But I kept it for days

852
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,360
I found that no one came to pick up the clothes at all

853
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,800
Customized clothes for customers

854
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,960
Why don't customers pick it up

855
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,520
I feel suspicious, too

856
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,480
It's really a little weird

857
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,800
I checked that locker, too

858
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,680
At that time, the boss was staring at it

859
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,760
Time is still tight

860
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,280
Didn't look too carefully

861
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,800
I didn't find any clues

862
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Why don't I check it out again

863
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,600
In the absence of certainty

864
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,960
Don't startle

865
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,160
Can you tell me something unusual about Zhou Ping

866
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,800
No

867
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,840
She's still the same

868
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,280
Go to work, eat out after work, go to the opera

869
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,360
Did she go to that pipe street

870
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,960
No

871
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,720
In this way

872
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,040
Instead of this blind tracking

873
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,560
It's better to wait for a rabbit

874
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,080
Let's adjust this strategy

875
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,200
In addition to sending someone to follow her,

876
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,680
You bring me someone yourself

877
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
Stick to the oblique street of tobacco bags

878
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,520
Then I don't know when she will go.

879
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,120
You don't care when she goes

880
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,360
She is sure to go

881
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,680
As soon as she shows up,

882
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,960
You'll be staring at me

883
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,320
See which store she went into

884
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,440
Understand

885
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,320
Red Tassel Sister

886
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,920
You see I helped you last time, didn't I

887
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,560
Am I not quite useful

888
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm so useful. Why don't you think about it again

889
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,160
Jujube, I know

890
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,960
You want to be a street activist

891
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
But you are too young now

892
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,480
In another two years

893
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,680
I'll definitely put you in division

894
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,880
I'm eighteen. I'm not young
