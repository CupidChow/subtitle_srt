1
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
You won't be sentenced to upbringing, will you

2
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
The sentence is light

3
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,800
Should be sentenced to heavy punishment

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,240
Sentence as good as you can

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,400
Let him learn his lesson well

6
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
Okay, okay, okay, okay

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,320
That's enough

8
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
That's enough

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,720
Me

10
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,680
I went there today

11
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,240
The old seven who was injured by your precious son

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Their home

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,160
I went to apologize to someone

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,920
That

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,440
What do the families of the victims say

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
This old seven is his father

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,920
He used to be a hooligan around Deshengmen

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
At first, I was adamant

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,600
Later, after knowing my identity,

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
The attitude is much better

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,720
After all, his son

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,000
First bully young women

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
First, move your hand

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,440
Plus I put this medical bill

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Mental damage compensation and this nutrition fee

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,800
It's all given to him

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,320
When people see that our attitude is so good,

28
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
Said not to pursue

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Then if the family members of the client

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,040
If you don't pursue it,

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
Then will our children be fine

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
You think beautifully

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
After all, our son was injured by someone

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,240
According to the law, it is possible to go up and down

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,960
You can either reeducation through labor or detention

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,520
So now there is an agreement

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
Plus our police station

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Adhering to the attitude of treating diseases and saving people

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Decided to give it to our son and the gap

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,440
Detain for fifteen days

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
Fifteen days

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
That child will suffer a lot, won't he

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,120
Then he deserved it

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,640
Juanzi, you are a troublemaker

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Xiaomin, are you still unreasonable

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,559
Dong Zi and Huo Zi went to the detention center because of you

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
You're not a troublemaker. Who is it

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,080
Good

49
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm a troublemaker

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
You're a princess

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
I can't compare with you

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,320
But Sun Xiaomin is not qualified to educate me

53
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
If it weren't for Dong Zi Huozi being caught in

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm too lazy to talk to you

55
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Because of Dong Zi

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Good

57
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
Sun Xiaomin, let me ask you something

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,640
Dong Zi and I share joys and sorrows

59
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,040
Our big night

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Where were you when you set up the cigarette stand

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
We're just starting business

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,720
Riding a scooter at one or two in the middle of the night

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Go to Million Village to pull vegetables and watermelons

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
When I came back to sell in the alley,

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Where are you

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Every time Dong Zi fights and causes trouble,

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
I was there for him

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,160
Because I like him

69
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
What do I Juanzi do for him

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,440
I will never say anything. I will

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,400
You are willing. You are willing

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
What are you saying to me

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm just saying this to you

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
I will

75
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,720
But Dongzi didn't want to

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,080
His heart is full of you

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,640
He's lost his soul when you're gone

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,120
When he sees you, his face is full of sunshine

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,440
Do you know Sun Xiaomin

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,120
I looked at the way he looked at you

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
I watched him see you

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,280
The appearance of smiling all over his face

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,840
My heart hurts

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm in terrible pain

85
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,600
But did I say anything

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
Sun Xiaomin

87
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,080
Everyone has the right to accuse me and scold me

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,640
Only you didn't

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,080
They're all here

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
Dong Zi, you didn't get bullied in there, did you

91
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
They dare to bully me

92
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,280
You're out of your mind

93
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,600
Who is Dong Zi's father

94
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,160
Who dares to bully him to die? No

95
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't you talk about him

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
I'm all covered with it

97
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
The little life here is comfortable

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
Smelly boy

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,160
Comfortable. You go in and don't come out

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Go back again

101
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
Then I won't go

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
Uncle Lin of Dong Zi and Aunt Hong Ying

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Come on, don't say it

104
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
It's a good thing my dad didn't come

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,280
My dad's bad temper

106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,400
He wants to see me like this

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
He must not scold me to death

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
You know how to scold you

109
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Is that your mother and your father scold you less

110
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
No, aunt, I didn't recruit you

111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
What do you think I'm doing

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,840
What else are you gonna do

113
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,720
Recruit big hair you

114
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,000
It's still beautiful. When is it still beautiful?

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,160
How good are you

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
They all came to the detention center

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
Say what to do with you

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,040
Aunt Zao, I was beaten

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm the victim

120
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Line line line

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Listen to me, everybody

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Starting tomorrow

123
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
Go to the neighborhood Committee every morning

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Give me a thought report

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
Reflect on the crimes you have committed

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Good aunt

127
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
No, no problem, no problem

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,840
Introspection, affirmation and introspection

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
See you tomorrow, Aunt Jujube

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Aunt Jujube, you can rest assured

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
I'm sure I'll ask for instructions early and report late

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,560
But now I have to

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,320
I have to take a bath

134
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Go to this bad luck

135
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,840
Walk, walk

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
Blue flag, blue flag, you

137
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
You said his father was still waiting for him

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,000
He does

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Would you please stop being angry

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Not bad for me this time

142
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,559
Don't you go

143
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,439
Can you not walk easily

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,200
You are hopeless

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
I have nothing to say to you

146
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,240
Look at that

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
Juanzi and Huozi are our two children

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
That Juanzi was bullied

149
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,640
Can I not be in a hurry

150
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,480
That gap is for Juanzi

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
That end has been spent by others

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,120
Can I not shoot

153
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,840
That's not what I'm talking about

154
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
That's not what you're talking about

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
Then what are you talking about

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,800
Dong Zi

157
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
You're in your twenties

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you want to hang out like this for the rest of your life

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Look what you are now

160
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,920
You can do it all

161
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,760
Go on, don't stop, go on

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,280
I don't want to say

163
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,720
Row

164
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
You don't want to say it. I'll say it for you

165
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
Don't you just think I'm like a loafer

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
A local ruffian and hooligan

167
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,120
An alley string, right

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,920
I didn't say you said that

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
You didn't say

170
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
But that's what you think in your heart

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Sun Xiaomin, I know you look down on me

172
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
You are a person who has ideals and pursuits

173
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
An aspiring young man

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,440
You go to college at night, you read poetry

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,520
You read poetry

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,360
You aspire to be

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
Literary youth like my brother

178
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
Then you go to him

179
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Why did you pick me up at the detention center

180
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
Lin Weidong

181
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
You're so muddy. You

182
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
I'm so happy

183
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
Don't come to me in your life if you have the ability

184
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Juanzi

185
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,280
You're going to bleed today

186
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,160
What do you know about Huozi

187
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,160
When the piano hit me,

188
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,800
I can't believe you rushed to me

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Get in my way like that

190
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,120
Today's meal is on me

191
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,760
It's really buddy. It's really brave

192
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
No matter how much blood I give, I will

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,640
Come

194
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,560
Then you know that I

195
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,360
Why did you do that at that time

196
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Juanzi

197
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,480
I've always liked you since I was a kid

198
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,680
Stop it

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,840
Really

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I swear

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Present and future

202
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,160
Until forever

203
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,480
I like you Juanzi alone

204
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,280
Gap me

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,440
Don't say anything, please

206
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,480
I know it all

207
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,040
In fact, you have always despised me

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
The person you like is Dongzi

209
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,440
But I also know that

210
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,960
One person likes another person

211
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,560
And another person has it in his heart

212
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
When another person is there

213
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
This bitterness

214
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
I understand

215
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,160
You must understand, too

216
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,160
Gap

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,800
Xiaomin came to see me two days ago

218
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,240
She said Dong Zi went in with you because of me

219
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,680
I had a quarrel with her

220
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,160
You broke up with Xiaomin

221
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,800
I argued with her just to tell her

222
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,120
Dong Zi is not a passer-by with her

223
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,480
Really should be with Dong Zi

224
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,800
It's me, not her

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
But don't be sad either

226
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,160
I know

227
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
Dong Zi and I will never be able to

228
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,160
Do you remember

229
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,160
When we were in high school,

230
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,480
The day Dong Zi was first taken away by the police

231
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
I probably remember

232
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,920
That seems to be because

233
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,600
A senior student bullied Xiaomin

234
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Then Dong Zi called him

235
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,560
The police came directly

236
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,800
He took it away in handcuffs

237
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Then do you remember

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
When Dong Zi was taken away by the police,

239
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,800
Did you say anything

240
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,680
I don't care about that

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
I-I really don't know Juanzi

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't know. I know

243
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,760
I was by his side at that time

244
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,280
When he was taken away by the police,

245
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,920
Turned around and said a word to Xiaomin

246
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,440
He told Xiaomin

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,920
Sun Xiaomin

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,520
In my life, Lin Weidong

249
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm gonna marry you

250
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,920
I knew it then

251
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
It's impossible for me and him in my life

252
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,600
Sun Xiaomin is the only one in Lin Weidong's heart

253
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,800
So you

254
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Then why do you always like Dong Zi

255
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm stupid

256
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,200
Eat vegetables

257
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
Come out Xiaomin

258
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,600
Dong Zi

259
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,920
Dong Zi

260
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,079
Dong Zi

261
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,640
Sun Xiaomin, I will marry you in my life

262
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,559
It's Sun Xiaomin

263
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Wei Dong likes Sun Xiaomin

264
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,320
Come on, come on, stop wandering around here

265
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,240
It makes me dizzy

266
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,200
Would you sit down for a while

267
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
Jujube, call me

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,760
Said she took Dong Zi out this afternoon

269
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
How come you haven't come back till now

270
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,040
It's better that he doesn't come back

271
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,720
I'll beat him out when I get back

272
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
How dare you

273
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,040
If you touch his finger,

274
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,320
Your son has fallen to what he is now

275
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
It's all your habit

276
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,760
Why is it my habit

277
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,280
When children go to school,

278
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,800
Another earthquake

279
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,560
Smashing the Gang of Four again

280
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
How busy the work is

281
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,320
How can I have time for my children to study

282
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Aren't you the same

283
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,960
When children lay the foundation,

284
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
I let the sheep go

285
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,440
Dongzicheng is like this today

286
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
You should also be responsible

287
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay

288
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,000
Talk from wheels

289
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
Here we go again

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
I won't talk to you about him today

291
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,520
Your son

292
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,040
I can't control it anymore

293
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,040
I want to have this ability

294
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,480
I'll give him a few more years

295
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
Let the government educate him well

296
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,080
Right

297
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Really high consciousness

298
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Put righteousness above family loyalty

299
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,800
If you can really do this,

300
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,840
You won't run to

301
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Where the victims' families are

302
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,760
Apologize again

303
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Losing money again

304
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
After all, it's my son

305
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,040
Can I leave it alone

306
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,840
Are you a simpleton

307
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,240
Protect Juanzi

308
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,840
Let people spend their heads

309
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
What do you think of you

310
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,080
Son

311
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
Does your head still hurt

312
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
Have you got stitches yet

313
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,120
It's okay, mom

314
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
I just made a small hole

315
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,120
You can rest assured

316
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,120
How is your son's skin

317
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
It's early

318
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
You are healed. The scar forgot the pain

319
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,440
How many times did you say you fought for Juanzi

320
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,240
It's good this time

321
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
He went straight to the detention center

322
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
I will

323
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
How dare you talk back

324
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
You think I'm too old to beat you, don't you

325
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Old man, old man

326
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,680
What are you doing

327
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,440
Put on your shoes

328
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,400
Look at you

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
You still think our blue flag

330
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,600
It's not enough to eat and suffer

331
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,360
What are you doing

332
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,800
Mom

333
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,560
Or are you good to me

334
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,600
This is a fascist

335
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,760
If I were a fascist,

336
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,600
I'll pull you out and cut you right away

337
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,640
I'm telling you

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,120
Starting today

339
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,520
You stay at home honestly

340
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,040
No more fooling around with Dong Zi and Juanzi

341
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,600
You know, right

342
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,680
Why go

343
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
Urgent mama

344
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,960
I have a rush to urinate

345
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,680
Go and come back quickly

346
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Look at that virtue

347
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,760
Quickly

348
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,320
Hurry up

349
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
Why are you here

350
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,680
Dong Zi, why don't you go home at night

351
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,480
It's back

352
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,000
My parents are yelling about me.

353
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,840
Me

354
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,880
Take the money and run out

355
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
What's the matter, Dong Zi

356
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,200
Brush at night

357
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
How can I stay at home

358
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,680
My dad must give me a beating for his temper

359
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,960
My mother must have stopped it, right

360
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,800
Boy

361
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,560
Because of this

362
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,840
The old couple fought again

363
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,960
My mom's having another heart attack

364
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,480
Then I have a great sin

365
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,640
Then what do you mean

366
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
I've already figured it out

367
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,160
Where's my eldest brother

368
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
Practice stalls in Xidan

369
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,560
He will go to Guangzhou to buy goods tomorrow

370
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going with him

371
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,040
The first is to stroll around and relax

372
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,080
Second, I'll see what business I can do

373
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,840
What's the matter

374
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
You also want to go to Guangzhou to purchase goods

375
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,600
Then go to Xidan to practice stalls

376
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,720
You don't know

377
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,480
In front of Xidan Clothing Building

378
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,480
There are a lot of practice stalls

379
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,120
They all sell wide goods

380
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,160
Business is getting old

381
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,800
I've been thinking about it for a long time

382
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,400
Pour out some clothes, frog mirror

383
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,480
Lighter or something

384
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,480
It's much better than getting up early and practicing cigarette stalls

385
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Isn't it

386
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,120
That's true

387
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,360
Dong Zi

388
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,600
I'll go with you in Guangzhou

389
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
I'll go too

390
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,760
Can you two just stop heckling

391
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,080
What do you mean heckling

392
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,880
Since you started selling vegetables,

393
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,840
Sell mutton skewers

394
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
Sell candied haws

395
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,120
Then practice cigarette stalls later

396
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,920
Huozi and I have been following you all the time

397
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
You went to Xidan to practice clothing stalls

398
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
You won't take us to play

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,480
Is

400
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,640
Is that what I mean

401
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
Am I the one

402
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,000
Then I don't care

403
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm going with you

404
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,240
And me

405
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,560
Dong Zi, I've already figured it out

406
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
I'll do what you do

407
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Well, let's do it then

408
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
What about you two? Go back first tonight

409
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm telling you

410
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,040
Remember

411
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't leak air

412
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,680
See you at the railway station tomorrow morning

413
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,200
So reassuring

414
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,720
Go back early

415
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,440
Dong Zi

416
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Where are you going to brush this big night

417
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,480
I'll go find my big brother

418
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,640
Just talk to him about how to practice this clothing stall

419
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,960
OK, see you tomorrow

420
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,320
Why do you talk so much

421
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,480
Bye bye

422
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,840
Go away

423
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Jujube

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,120
Jujube

425
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Sister has something to do early in the morning

426
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Dong Zi didn't come home all night last night

427
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,160
I can't believe it

428
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
I brought him back from detention yesterday

429
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,360
Xiaomin went with him

430
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,000
What about Xiaomin

431
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,320
Xiaomin came back late last night

432
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
I don't think she is very happy

433
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,200
I seem to have cried

434
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,400
I also asked her if she had quarreled with Dong Zi

435
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,800
Ignoring me

436
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,720
Go back to the house and go to sleep

437
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,760
Then you should wake her up quickly

438
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,040
I'll ask what's going on

439
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
Xiaomin

440
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,120
Xiaomin

441
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,880
Xiaomin

442
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
What's wrong with Mom

443
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Aunt Hong Ying asked you about Dong Zi

444
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,200
Xiaomin

445
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,840
Was Dong Zi with you last night

446
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,680
So when did you split up

447
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
Where did he go after the separation

448
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,680
I don't know

449
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,640
How could you not know

450
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Aunt Red Tassel

451
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
I broke up with Wei Dong

452
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,080
Don't ask me about him in the future

453
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
Xiaomin

454
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,360
Look at this child

455
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,560
Jujube sister

456
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
Jujube sister

457
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,440
This Juanzi is too outrageous

458
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Come together in the morning

459
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
Keep such a note

460
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
Run away

461
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,640
Mom, me and Dong Zi

462
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,520
I went to Guangzhou to play with Huozi

463
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,520
I'll be back in a couple of days

464
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
Don't worry

465
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,360
Getting bolder and bolder

466
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,440
Jujube

467
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,480
I really can't control this

468
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
You said the blue flag just came out yesterday

469
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,920
It disappeared this morning

470
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
And stole a lot of my money

471
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Went to Guangzhou

472
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,880
This is not the three of them. Look

473
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,240
I went to Guangzhou

474
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,720
This is not what I just said. This Juanzi wrote it

475
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
This little bastard

476
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
That and that

477
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,560
So many socks

478
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,120
So many models

479
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,800
Look at so many styles

480
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,040
Here we are, here we are

481
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
This is Ali's shop. It's here. It's here

482
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,680
Xiaoli

483
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:21,920
Xiaoli

484
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,480
Big Brother, you're here

485
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,000
Dong Zi, let me introduce you

486
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,280
This is the owner of this shop

487
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,600
We all call her Xiaoli

488
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,080
Hello, Sister Xiaoli

489
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,000
Handsome boy, I am twenty-one

490
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,720
How old are you

491
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,640
I, I

492
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,040
We're about the same

493
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm a little older than you

494
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,040
That's great

495
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,880
You can be my brother from now on

496
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,080
This is where to go

497
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll call my brother

498
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,800
This woman is really surfing

499
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,680
I'm from Guangdong

500
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
It's more open

501
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,000
Go

502
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,920
Dong Zi, don't look at Xiaoli's youth

503
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
From the reform and opening up to the present

504
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
Has been doing business in this street

505
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
Make it very big

506
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,960
If you need anything in

507
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
This little sister helps you

508
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
There is nothing wrong with it

509
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,760
Sounds great

510
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,080
I have to ask you to help me more after that

511
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,800
You're my brother now

512
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,720
Can I not help you

513
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
Say what you want to buy

514
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,560
I don't really understand either

515
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,520
Anyway, you can enter whatever you want to sell

516
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
I'm telling you

517
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,120
You are like this Gaudi Street in Guangzhou now

518
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,360
Beijing Street

519
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,320
Thirteen lines and nine up and down

520
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,240
These commercial streets

521
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,600
You northerners come here everywhere to buy goods

522
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,760
You look like this one in my shop

523
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,240
Graphite blue jeans

524
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,120
Batmobile shirt T-shirt frog mirror

525
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,760
Playboy banana shirt

526
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,760
It's not that banana shirt. What is it

527
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,320
It's Monte Banana's T-shirt

528
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
That's right

529
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,960
And this leather shoe with the head of the three-A old man

530
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,960
Satchi's bag

531
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,160
These are all good goods

532
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Too many

533
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,040
I'd better focus on clothes

534
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,160
Do as you please

535
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,600
So this is it

536
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,960
You just take some of those jeans

537
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,760
Batmobile shirt and T-shirt

538
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,280
By the way, the frog mirror and the electronic watch

539
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,000
Take them all with you

540
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,520
These are very easy to walk in your Beijing

541
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
Cheng Cheng Cheng

542
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,240
Anyway, just watch and help me match it

543
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,000
Weighing and matching

544
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,280
What do you mean

545
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,320
Is to let you help stock up

546
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,360
Right, right, right

547
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,880
Your Beijing dialect is really interesting

548
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,000
Is it

549
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
It's still successful

550
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Lailai elder brother

551
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Come on, come on

552
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,600
This metapenaeus ensis is delicious

553
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,880
You can't get tired of eating it

554
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,160
If it's delicious, eat more

555
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Juanzi, don't always patronize eating that metapenaeus ensis

556
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,320
Try this

557
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Fried crab with onion and ginger

558
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,680
Yebi stick

559
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,240
Row

560
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,400
By the way, brother

561
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,280
I thought I told you to invite Xiaoli over

562
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,720
Why isn't she here

563
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,560
We will go back to Beijing tomorrow

564
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,280
She's stocking us up tonight

565
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,760
Xiaoli asked me to tell you

566
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,880
She will invite you to dinner next time in Guangzhou

567
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,000
How embarrassed I am

568
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Dong Zi

569
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,920
We've got all the goods, too

570
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,520
We will go back to Beijing tomorrow

571
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,520
What's the matter

572
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Are you really going to practice stalls in Xidan

573
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,800
Really plan to fuck brother

574
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,520
And thank you very much for your help this time

575
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,040
Nothing to say

576
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,360
Who told you to be my brother

577
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,200
Who will help you if I don't help you

578
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,000
Fortunately, this Xidan clothing building

579
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
The open space ahead

580
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,960
There are not many people practicing stalls now

581
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
You will go now. There must be your place

582
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
In a few months

583
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,600
You're going to set up a stall there

584
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,920
You'll have no place

585
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,440
Are you two listening

586
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
With big brother's help,

587
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,720
We must practice well in this booth

588
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,280
Necessary

589
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
Come brother come

590
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,440
To you

591
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,120
Brother Lai

592
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,000
Come on, come on

593
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,640

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,440
Take a look and have a look.

Take a look and have a look

603
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,639
Let's count it one by one

604
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,280
Don't miss passing by

605
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,520

Take a look and have a look

608

Juanzi

614
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
How much do you earn today

615
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,280
Net profit of 200 gross

616
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
That's fifty more than yesterday

617
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,680
Are you watching

618
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,720
Our wide range of goods is like no money

619
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,320
Customers don't even ask for the price

620
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
As much as we say is as much as we say

621
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,400
Yes

622
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,640
Dong Zi

623
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,640
Our incoming goods

624
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
It's almost sold

625
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,680
Do you have to kill Guangzhou again these two days

626
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,200
Have to kill

627
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
But a trip for three days and two nights

628
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,840
Come back for three days and two nights

629
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,040
It's all delayed on the way

630
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,080
No

631
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,080
How many do you mean

632
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,880
What can I do without delay

633
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,480
I plan to go by plane

634
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Aircraft

635
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,440
That's for people of high rank

636
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,320
And you have to go to work to buy a plane ticket

637
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,920
What about opening a letter of introduction and stamping an official seal

638
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,960
Keep your voice down

639
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm telling you

640
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,360
I would have inquired about it a long time ago

641
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
It's not so strict now

642
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,080
Just have money

643
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,240
Then this plane is much more expensive than the train

644
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,720
Yeah

645
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,560
Look, you haven't seen the world

646
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,920
You know what

647
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,520
There is a popular saying in Shenzhen now

648
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,000
Time is money

649
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,120
Efficiency is life

650
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,040
Do you want to

651
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,440
I can fly back and forth once a day

652
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,640
It takes seven days to take the train

653
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,960
How much less do we have to sell

654
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,200
How much less money do you earn

655
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,960
It's really such a reason

656
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,440
That has to

657
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,160
Division approved you

658
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,960
Buy air tickets tomorrow

659
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,200
Go to Guangzhou for loading

660
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
Okay, no problem

661
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,040
Thank you, organization

662
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,440
Dong Zi

663
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,240
You see

664
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
We have been busy selling goods this week

665
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Do you think about it, too

666
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
Treat us both

667
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,920
Approved

668
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,600
You two eat and drink open

669
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,320
The money goes off the account

670
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,360
But

671
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
I won't accompany you tonight

672
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,480
Hold it for me

673
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,840
Bye, I'll jump first

674
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,680
Why are you going

675
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,360
Go, go, go

676
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,120
Hard work

677
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,480
You don't have to ask

678
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,960
The valve core has gone to watch the wind again

679
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,040
The valve core has gone to watch the wind again

680
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,000
Loading

681
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,480
Quickly

682
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,080
Xiaomin

683
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,640
Brother Wei Min

684
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,000
Didn't I tell you

685
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,160
Don't come and pick me up

686
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Why are you still here

687
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,920
I don't feel at ease when you go home alone at night

688
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,480
You always come to pick me up like this

689
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,600
At school

690
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,280
Being seen has a bad influence

691
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
What's there?

692
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,040
I'll take my girlfriend home

693
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
Who can say anything else

694
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
Brother Weimin, how many times have I told you

695
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,200
I'm not your girlfriend

696
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,480
You see, you're in a hurry. Okay, okay

697
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,600
Can the brother pick up his sister and go back

698
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,400
Suit yourself

699
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,240
Wait for me

700
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,200
Spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee

701
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,480
And specific documents

702
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,760
Everyone has studied it

703
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,480
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee

704
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,640
Break the two whatevers

705
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,320
Time is the only criterion for testing truth

706
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,800
And formulated the policy of reform and opening up

707
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Economic reform carried out in rural areas

708
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,400
Achieve great success

709
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,400
Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee

710
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
Is to make the rural reform successful

711
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,840
Experience and methods

712
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,880
Vigorously popularize it in urban reform

713
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,160
Intensify reform and opening up

714
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,680
Stimulate the reform vitality of urban economy

715
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,560
Is the focus of our current work

716
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,960
How good is the party's policy

717
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,640
Is to do practical things

718
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,080
Comrades

719
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
Now the individual economy of the whole society

720
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,400
Has flourished

721
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,720
In order to further promote the reform,

722
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,200
Invigorate the economy

723
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,480
Facilitate the masses

724
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,840
The municipal government decided to go to the urban area of Beijing

725
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,400
Try several night markets

726
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,760
Chief, this is a good thing

727
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,160
Did you say where to do it?

728
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
What we know now is that

729
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
East section of Donganmen Street

730
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,240
Hongqiao industrial products market

731
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,680
Luomashi Street

732
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,040
There are also squares in front of Xidan Clothing Building

733
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,200
That is to say

734
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,400
Dongcheng Xicheng Chongwen Xuanwu has it

735
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,160
Yes

736
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,080
Yes yes yes

737
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,160
Yes, that's good. Good

738
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
What about developing the individual economy

739
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,600
1

740
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,520
It is to further deepen reform and opening up

741
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,400
Principles of invigorating the economy

742
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,160
Second, it is to alleviate

743
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,960
Educated youth and unemployed youth returning to the city

744
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,200
Employment problem

745
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,240
So our street office

746
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,040
And various street neighborhood committees

747
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,920
We must take concrete actions

748
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,200
To serve these self-employed people

749
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,640
Assist them in handling

750
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,680
At the same time of self-employed license

751
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
They should also be educated politically and ideologically

752
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,200
Let them do it practically

753
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,880
Serve the general public

754
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,640
I don't think you remember a word today

755
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,240
Drink water

756
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,920
You know that

757
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,960
My pen leader doesn't have a good brain yet

758
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,800
Elder sister

759
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,000
You said we used to talk every day

760
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,400
Cut the tail of capitalism

761
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,840
Now we should advocate invigorating the economy

762
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,880
Call on those unemployed youths

763
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,280
Go and do small business

764
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,440
I just can't figure it out

765
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Jujube

766
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,600
It has been so many years since the reform and opening up

767
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,520
This thought hasn't turned around yet

768
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,000
Not here

769
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,000
This bend is too big

770
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,560
I can't turn around a little

771
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,640
Society is developing

772
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,480
The country is also making progress

773
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,720
You

774
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,320
Look at the essence through phenomena

775
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,000
I want to ask you

776
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,400
These self-employed people

777
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,120
Let them earn their own living

778
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,040
Get economic benefits through one's own hands

779
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
At the same time, it can enrich the people in Beijing

780
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Demand for material

781
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,640
I'm all ears

782
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,000
Is this the best of both worlds

783
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,520
Yes and a good thing

784
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,600
But you said

785
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,600
So many unemployed young people go to the streets to set up stalls

786
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,120
Streets and alleys

787
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,800
How chaotic Beijing is

788
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,760
Jujube

789
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
Fifties

790
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
Our Party Establishes New China

791
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,120
It is to let the people live a good life

792
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,920
Eighties

793
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,080
We carry out the policy of reform and opening up

794
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,400
Its purpose is also to let the people live a good life

795
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,560
You can't figure it out

796
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,920
Don't mention it

797
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,240
Just go and have a look

798
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,040
Those residents of your segment

799
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,680
Their lives are not improving

800
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,040
In the hands of ordinary people

801
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,320
Are you getting rich slowly
