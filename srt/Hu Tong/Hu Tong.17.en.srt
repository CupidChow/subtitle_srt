1
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,920
You once said to me

2
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,400
You love me forever

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,320
I understand this thing about love

4
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,039
But always what

5
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,040
Girl, don't cry

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,920
We're still together

7
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,960
The Joy of the Day

8
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,640
Will be an eternal memory of tomorrow

9
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:45,120
La la la la la la la

10
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,120
The Joy of the Day

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Will be an eternal memory of tomorrow

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Anything can be discarded

13
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,840
You can't forget anything

14
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Now all you say is your courage

15
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,120
The wind blows in spring

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,680
It rains in autumn

17
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,160
How many vows of eternal love go away with the wind in spring breeze and autumn rain

18
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:38,240
La la la la la la la

19
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
What you said today

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,640
It's just your courage

21
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Come and watch it

22
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,040
Long Arrow Short Wan Hilton Good Friend

23
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Plus black mole

24
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
Come and see. Come and buy it.

25
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
I said Dong Zi

26
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Don't you shout, what are you doing with this

27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
It's almost noon

28
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,800
Why doesn't Xiaomin come yet

29
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,160
That's right

30
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
My big brother is back

31
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,320
Now the whole hospital

32
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,480
They are helping to demolish the kitchen and build a house

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,880
I guess Xiaomin is there, too

34
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
Collected, collected, collected

35
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Collecting and spreading

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,920
Accepted

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Dong Zi

39
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,560
The last batch of cigarettes we entered

40
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,840
That's all that's left

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,680
I thought you said

42
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,520
Said to sell out this batch of cigarettes quickly

43
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,840
Take the money

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,680
Will you smoke outside Desheng Gate tomorrow morning

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
It doesn't matter if you sell one day early and one day late

47
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
Didn't you hear Juanzi say her big brother is back

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,519
The whole hospital is helping to build the house

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
We can't reach out our hands

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
No need

51
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
My mom, Uncle Suo, the whole hospital is here

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,320
This is not necessary

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
There are enough people

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,600
It's not wrong to say that you lack a string in your brain

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,360
Think about how old they are, aunt jujube

56
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
How old are you

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,880
You have the heart to let them do this dirty work

58
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
Ah ah

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Yeah, my dad's here, too

60
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
Hurry up and collect the stalls

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Quick, quick, quick

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Walk, walk

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:49,920
Quick and quick

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,680
Watch your hands

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
Go, go, go, go

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,840
Xiaomin, you fine-skinned and tender

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,080
Not the people who do this job

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Leave it alone and go back to the house and read

69
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,840
Aunt, I can do it

70
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Just let her move

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
You should exercise yourself

72
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,840
Jujube menstruation

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,440
I said the old guys

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,840
How old are you still doing this job

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Isn't it just building a house

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Leave it to me

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll come, I'll come, I'll come

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,560
Let's do it

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Let these young people do it

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,280
They have the strength

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Go for tea

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Dong Zi

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,120
You work slowly

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Aunt Xiulan, you can rest assured

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
That's all the work

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm telling you that back then

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,400
I didn't do less of the chaff-beating and blanking work

88
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
You never cut in line

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
What kind of work have you done

90
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,400
You forgot

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
When I dug the air-raid shelter,

92
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,920
Your brother and I are strong laborers

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
What kind of work haven't we done

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
Not you. Help you help Xiaomin.

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,840
I'm working on it

96
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,440
You do something for her

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,760
Look, look, look, look

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,000
No, I can prove that Dong Zi works

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,040
At that time, one top two did not hesitate to do anything

100
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
Or does my aunt understand me

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,080
I remember that

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,120
You gave me a certificate of merit that year

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Say what I am

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
Labor activists

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,800
Right, right, right

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm telling you, aunt

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
That certificate of merit I have until now

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,400
And hang it on the wall at home with a photo frame

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,200
Look at your glorious

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't knock yourself

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
Or this is enjoyable

112
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,280
Brother Gangzi

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,640
It's not our brother who said you

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
How did you marry a man

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
The rustic rural daughter-in-law came back

116
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,520
Huozi, can you talk

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,680
How come my sister-in-law is so dirty

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,680
Two hadrons two hadrons

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,600
Huozi said this for my own good

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,120
Brothers

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
How can I tell you

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,080
Let's put it this way

123
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,760
In those days

124
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I feel that I will stay in the countryside in my life

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,200
Really

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
Local fellow villagers are also kind

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
It didn't take long to talk to our educated youth

128
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,240
Mingled together

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Just say the village party secretary in our village

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,080
Think I'm not bad

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,800
Begging for nothing, he insisted on marrying his daughter to me

132
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,840
This thought of mine

133
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
Horizontal is also a knot, vertical is also a knot

134
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,200
I didn't care about my mother's objection

135
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,200
Get married and get married

136
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,280
Brother Gangzi, I take the liberty of asking

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,000
You said you said

138
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,400
This is between you and your sister-in-law

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
Is there love

140
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,960
Love

141
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
Love

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,360
This word is too much for us people

143
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
How do you say

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,120
My wife is extravagant

145
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Yes, it's too extravagant

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,320
Our marriage is called helping to live

147
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,120
Nothing else

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,320
Come on, come on, come on

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Brother Gangzi, I didn't say that just now

150
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,360
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,160
Aunt, you cooked this meal

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,960
It's much better than my mother's

153
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,560
Your mother and your father are busy at work

154
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
I eat the canteen all the year round

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She can't cook

156
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
I am old in these two years

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
Down the kitchen

158
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,760
Smelly boy

159
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
Your parents spent half their lives

160
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,960
Are busy for the people

161
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,680
Not easy

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,760
Of course, I really lost your brothers

163
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,080
Don't complain, don't complain

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
How can you complain if you don't complain

165
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
The Communist Party works for the common people

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
That's what they should be

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
Give up your family and take care of everyone

168
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,680
This is their duty

169
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,360
Look at this consciousness

170
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,040
Dong Zi

171
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,880
You can really speak vernacular with this mouth

172
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,800
Is it all right

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
If I can't speak vernacular

174
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,960
Can the business at my cigarette stand be that good

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,120
Dong Zi, I have to ask you this

176
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,440
Aunt, don't say it first

177
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,520
You let me say

178
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,560
You said

179
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
I assure Chairman Mao

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Xiaomin didn't practice cigarette stalls with us

181
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Really not

182
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,840
Really didn't go

183
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,200
Do you want to

184
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
Who is this Xiaomin

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,720
That dozen small

186
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Is a flower in our children

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,640
This can't be said to be the snow lotus in Tianshan Mountains

188
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,560
That is also the Chimonanthus praecox with proud snow at the peak

189
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Aloof and elegant temperament

190
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
You said someone like this

191
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,360
How can you talk to us profiteers

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
It's colluding with each other, isn't it

193
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
Aunt Zaoyi, do you think so

194
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,560
It's an insult to her

195
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Look at this mouth, this poor man

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
It is also an insult

197
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Where is it? This is all

198
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,320
No, I'm telling the truth.

199
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Truth

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,600
Then you tell me

201
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,200
Did Xiaomin go to your cigarette stand

202
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
I've gone

203
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Don't tell me you told her to go

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I really didn't ask her to go

205
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
She went alone

206
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,160
Lin Weidong

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Comrade Xiao Min

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,400
I know

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,200
The reason why you took the initiative to find me at the cigarette stall

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
Then you are afraid of me, Lin Weidong

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
Don't change old habits and make trouble

212
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Fight and make trouble with customers

213
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,880
And then you're afraid of me

214
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,640
Brought Juanzi and the gap to the bad

215
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,800
That's why you took out your precious time

216
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Go to the cigarette stall to supervise and advise me

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
This, this, this is enough to prove it

218
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,000
Your two old girls have a very high ideological consciousness

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
That also proves that

220
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
Xiaomin told us young people

221
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,520
A piece of love

222
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,720
Aunt, I haven't finished yet

223
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm telling you

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,080
I told you that

225
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,080
It's all from the bottom of my heart

226
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
It is precisely because of Comrade Xiaomin that

227
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,760
Love for me during this time

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
So

229
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,200
I actively implement and respond to the party and the country

230
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
The Spirit of Five Lectures, Four Beauties and Three Loves Advocated

231
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
Serve customers wholeheartedly

232
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,400
Haven't quarreled with anyone

233
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,200
I haven't touched anyone

234
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,360
So today

235
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,960
I want to be in front of your parents

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Comrade Xiaomin

237
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,280
I hope Comrade Xiaomin will make persistent efforts

238
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,600
Continue to be open to me. Juanzi still has a gap

239
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Supervise and instruct

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
And correct us

241
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
In the process of practicing cigarette stalls,

242
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
All the bad tendencies that appear

243
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,920
You, you, sit down

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,520
I haven't said anything yet

245
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
Look at his big theories

246
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,560
So I don't know how to praise you

247
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Or should I scold you

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,760
Scold

249
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,160
Scold hard

250
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm telling you I won't grow up without being scolded

251
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,880
I am Lin Weidong, who is in my father and mother

252
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,640
Jujube aunt Xiaomin

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
And, of course, Uncle Iron Egg

254
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,280
Can you thrive in the midst of bristle

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,680
Dong Zi

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,040
Don't you talk nonsense with me here

257
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
You said you haven't had a fight lately

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
The face of Tu Liuzi a few days ago

259
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
Who called

260
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
He also chased you people with people

261
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
Chasing like a wave duck

262
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,800
Tell Aunt Jujube about this

263
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,640
Jujube aunt

264
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,920
I was just about to tell you about it

265
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,800
What about that day

266
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,120
Let's go to the disco and dance

267
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,720
And then it was because Comrade Xiaomin

268
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,200
Didn't supervise and advise me in time

269
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Therefore, in this ideological consciousness,

270
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,000
There is a little slack

271
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,160
That's why it led to such serious consequences

272
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,400
Comrade Xiao Min

273
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
I have to criticize you for this.

274
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,160
Why don't you look at me

275
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I asked you to go disco dancing with me

276
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,080
You're not going

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,400
You have to go to some poetry meeting with my brother

278
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm telling you

279
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,480
You can't do this again in the future

280
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
If you want to let me go like this again,

281
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,320
How can you live up to Aunt Jujube

282
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
How can I live up to my parents

283
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Uncle Suo and Aunt Suo

284
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,280
And Aunt Xiulan's ardent hope for you

285
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,720
Fuck off

286
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Aunt, I, I, I have finished saying everything I should say

287
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm full of food, too

288
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,920
And then we'll talk about it later

289
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,720
Bye-bye, Uncle Tiedan. How about you

290
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,800
Smelly boy

291
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Tell me about it quickly

292
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Almost catch up with his mother

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Give us a report. That's the theoretical level

294
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,840
Better than his mother

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
It's a fight with his father

296
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Flower

297
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
This will be our house in the future

298
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,040
Gangzi

299
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,640
I feel humbled

300
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,400
What's the matter

301
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,520
The city is not like ours

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,040
There are many people in the city, which is not as spacious as ours

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,240
It's not like yours

304
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,440
Then walk out of two miles

305
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
I can't even see a personal shadow

306
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Nothing

307
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,400
We get used to living

308
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,560
Xiaomin

309
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,360
Why are you here? I've been waiting for you for a long time

310
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,520
Why do you want me if you don't go to work

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
I told our unit

312
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,120
Go talk to the author about the manuscript

313
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Isn't this coming to you

314
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,280
Then look for me at my house

315
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,520
Why did you ask me here

316
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,600
Fuck your family's eyes

317
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Besides, Aunt Zao has to talk for a long time when she sees me

318
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
Isn't it nice here

319
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,200
How picturesque and romantic it is

320
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,480
Have something to say

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,440
I don't have time for romance with you here

322
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,320
Look, it's urgent for you

323
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
Admission Notice of Night University

324
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
I have already signed up for you

325
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,960
School starts in two days

326
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,080
I thought you said that the other day

327
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,600
I didn't expect to really sign up for me

328
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
Your business is bigger than the sky with me

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
Do I dare not hurry up

330
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you, Brother Weimin

331
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,280
Come and take it

332
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,760
This is a book for studying at night university

333
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,680
This pen

334
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
The whole set is ready for you

335
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,880
Xiaomin

336
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,600
Although this night is not as big as the university,

337
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
But they all come from various universities

338
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,120
A transferred teacher

339
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440
The teaching quality is quite high

340
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
What about this night? It's mainly

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,800
It's looser than the university management

342
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Learning depends on self-awareness

343
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,440
But your self-conscious enthusiasm for learning

344
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm not worried

345
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,720
But your character

346
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,880
A little lonely and doesn't like to communicate with others

347
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,240
So what are your problems with your studies

348
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,760
You should learn to communicate with teachers more

349
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Only in this way can you do a good job in this study

350
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,440
Get the diploma smoothly, right

351
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,400
I know

352
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,320
Xiaomin

353
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,440
As long as you get your diploma

354
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm sure to get you into our magazine

355
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,440
By then, we will be

356
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,880
Colleague relationship

357
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,320
Can help each other and make progress together

358
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,000
The main reason is that you have finished one of your own

359
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Literary dream

360
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,359
I said Dong Zi

361
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,680
Why are you like a cucumber with fallen seedlings

362
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,520
Withered

363
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,320
The sun is too big to be exposed

364
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,160
Come on, you're not basking in it

365
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,560
You are because these days

366
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,719
Xiaomin didn't come to our cigarette stall to chat with you

367
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,760
Annoying

368
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,840
Dong Zi seems that day

369
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,360
Your vernacular with Aunt Zaoyi didn't work

370
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,120
Who is my aunt jujube

371
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
That's the director of the neighborhood Committee

372
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
Let him talk nonsense

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,600
You can be taken in by him

374
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,760
Think beautifully

375
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
It's not that you two waste any words

376
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
Do you still practice the stall

377
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,960
Hurry and shout

378
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Good

379
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,360
A long arrow is short, Hilton's good friend

380
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,240
Black mole

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
How do you sell cigarettes

382
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,720
It's moldy

383
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,720
What are you yelling at me about

384
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,760
The cigarettes you sell are moldy

385
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,880
Why are you profiteers so dark

386
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,000
I told you not to talk nonsense to me here

387
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
Your shouting here is affecting my business

388
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm in a hurry with you

389
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
You're in a hurry with me. I'm not in a hurry yet

390
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
Cut the crap and refund the money

391
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,760
Refund money

392
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
Old

393
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,520
The cigarettes you sold me are moldy

394
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
Why don't you give me a refund

395
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,200
Who can prove that I sold you this cigarette

396
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,120
I just bought cigarettes from you

397
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,400
It's not ten minutes before and after

398
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,160
What's the matter? I don't recognize it now, do I

399
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
It's true that you bought cigarettes from me

400
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,040
But you're gone

401
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,520
This will take one

402
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,760
The mildewed and damp smoke came back to me

403
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,640
I'm telling you

404
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,400
I've seen a lot of people like you

405
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,640
It's okay to get a box of broken cigarettes

406
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,280
Fuck me and cheat money

407
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,400
There is no door either

408
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I deceived my money

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,280
Why are you talking about people? You

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,560
I sprayed you today. What's the matter

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
Hurry up and get out of here with your broken smoke

412
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,600
I'll slap you no more

413
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,360
Forget it

414
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,200
What's wrong with you

415
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,560
OK, I can't make your business today

416
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
Don't don't don't

417
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,920
Don't fight, don't fight

418
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Don't fight

419
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,840
Don't fight

420
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Don't fight, don't fight

421
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,160
What to do

422
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
It's not over, is it

423
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
It's you vendors again

424
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,040
Make trouble here at two ends for three days

425
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,200
Give me the things to collect

426
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

427
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,720
It was they who fought

428
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,160
What are you doing with our booth

429
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,320
Why do you talk so much nonsense

430
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm telling you

431
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
Just you profiteers

432
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
One counts as one

433
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,640
There is not a good thing

434
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,120
Copied it for me and took it with me

435
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,680
No

436
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Close

437
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,040
Juanzi Run

438
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
Make way

439
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,120
This is my cigarette. My cigarette

440
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
Don't move, don't move

441
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
My cigarette

442
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
It costs money

443
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
No, no, no, don't do it. Don't fight. Don't fight

444
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,920
Xiaomin is not good. Something big has happened

445
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,320
You don't practice smoking at the Dong Zi stall

446
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,640
What are you doing here

447
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Dong Zi and Huozi

448
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
They were all arrested by the joint defense team

449
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm really sorry

450
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm causing you trouble.

451
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
This is said again, Director Tian

452
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
If you hadn't come here to vouch for them today,

453
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
I really can't let them go easily

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,760
Not later

455
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,880
I told you we weren't fighting, were we

456
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,000
We are persuaded to fight

457
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,160
Why are you arresting us

458
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
And copied our cigarettes

459
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
You have a reason

460
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,960
Of course I have a point

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,720
Without approval

462
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,960
You set up stalls everywhere

463
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Just you profiteers

464
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,640
Make trouble everywhere

465
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Cause extremely bad influence on society

466
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,440
It's not us making trouble. What

467
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
Which eye did you see us making trouble

468
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm fighting. How many times have I told you

469
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,080
Come on

470
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,960
Look, look, look

471
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,560
This attitude

472
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Captain, our neighborhood Committee will go back

473
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
They must be strictly disciplined

474
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
No more trouble for the government

475
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
It's high time for education

476
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,520
It's not the way you see his little man succeed

477
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,640
What's so good about him

478
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Say something bad

479
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,840
Isn't it the captain of a broken joint defense

480
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
My mother is his immediate superior

481
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm going to tell him who my mother is

482
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,000
Does he dare to treat me like this

483
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,240
Don't give your mother away here

484
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
Jujube aunt jujube aunt hurry for a walk

485
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,960
Aunt Jujube, where are our cigarettes

486
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
Come on, don't give Aunt Zao any trouble

487
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,200
That cigarette should be sent to them

488
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,800
Walk, walk, don't walk, ancestors

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,080
I didn't look at the almanac when I went out

490
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,080
Go quickly

491
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,240
You can fight with people by selling a cigarette

492
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
And let the joint defense copy it

493
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,880
Dad, let me correct you

494
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm not the one fighting. I'm the one fighting

495
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,360
No, no, no, you

496
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,240
Let me tell you something

497
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,120
You put me and your mother's face

498
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,280
It's all lost

499
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Dad, I'll correct you again

500
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm dead in the defense team

501
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,160
I didn't say my last name was Lin

502
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,520
I didn't say you were my dad either

503
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,920
I didn't even say my mother was my mother

504
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,360
So the faces of your parents are still there

505
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,880
To say disgrace

506
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,560
That's just to embarrass me Lin Weidong

507
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
You heard me, didn't you

508
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,200
This is your precious son

509
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,080
I can't control it anymore

510
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,200
Take care of it

511
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,120
You take care of him

512
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
You stand still

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Dong Zi

514
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
You're a big old man, too

515
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,760
All day

516
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,160
You're like a headless fly

517
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,560
Wander around this street

518
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
Pour east and west

519
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,880
When will it end?

520
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Mom, what will I do if I don't turn my back?

521
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
I have to eat too, don't I

522
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,080
You can't go on like this

523
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,360
Your mother and I

524
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,680
All right, your mother, I

525
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,320
I'll pull this old face off in a big deal

526
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,760
I'll ask for help

527
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
I'll find you a job

528
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,120
Mom

529
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,160
Save it, please

530
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,680
So many people have no jobs now

531
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,680
This is the job you asked someone to find a relationship for me

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,480
You are not afraid of being poked in your spine

533
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,920
You still take this opportunity

534
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,840
Leave it to the vast number of outstanding young people

535
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,400
Besides

536
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,880
The money I earned at this cigarette booth for one night

537
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
It almost catches up with their monthly salary

538
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,280
You're letting me pout my ass now

539
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Work hard in the big sun for a month

540
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,600
I just earned that little piece of eighty cents

541
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
I can't do this job

542
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,480
I really can't do it

543
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,040
What do you want to do

544
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,480
Then wander around the street

545
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,920
Anyway

546
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Anyway, the cigarette stall can't work now

547
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
I also saved some money

548
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll play for two days first

549
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,160
Mom, please don't be angry, will you

550
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
Take a moment

551
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,480
Jujube sister

552
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
Shirley Bar

553
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,640
You're here. Sit down quickly

554
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,520
Sit down quickly

555
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,360
Sit and sit

556
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,840
That's enough

557
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Let me get you a glass of water

558
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,200
You are welcome

559
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,480
Come and I'll compare it to you

560
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,240
Nothing

561
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,320
Something happened

562
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,840
It's no big deal

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
It's just that my heart is blocked

564
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,320
I want to talk to you

565
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:21,960
Come

566
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,320
You two talk. I'll talk to Suo Ye for a while

567
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Xiaomin is not here

568
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
Don't you think it's time to start school at night

569
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,560
Go to school

570
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,160
Or is your family Xiaomin promising

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,720
What's your promise

572
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,040
I can only go to college last night if I fail to pass the college entrance examination

573
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,320
At the very least, Xiaomin loves to learn

574
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,200
Demand progress

575
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,400
Don't talk about her

576
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,520
What's the traffic jam that's causing you to panic

577
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,920
What else can I do

578
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,680
This Gangzi has been young for two months since he returned to the city

579
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
There's nothing to do all day

580
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,600
In addition to sweeping the yard and doing some home work,

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,360
Is to sit in the house with his daughter-in-law in a daze

582
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,560
It's going to go on like this

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,080
That child can't suppress his illness yet

584
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,800
What did the office say

585
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
You should know this better than me

586
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,360
This Gangzi goes to the office every week

587
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,240
The threshold of the office

588
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,680
He's almost stepping through it

589
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
But people just don't solve it

590
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
It's not that you don't solve it

591
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Look at the educated youth who returned to the city in 1979

592
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
Most of them have not been arranged

593
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,920
Plus, there are so many unemployed youths now

594
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,440
The country really can't arrange so many people

595
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,200
So I can't help it

596
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
To ask you for help

597
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,320
Elder sister

598
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,720
Gangzi grew up watching you

599
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,480
When I gave birth to him

600
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,560
Or did you hold him and take me out of the hospital

601
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,640
You can't leave Gangzi alone

602
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,960
Can't leave you alone. Don't worry

603
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,320
I keep it in mind

604
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,680
Or my sister

605
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,360
Come

606
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,280
Say something slowly

607
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,920
I also said what I should say, Director Lin Da

608
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Don't call me that

609
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,080
I can't stand it

610
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,520
How do you call it Lao Lin

611
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,760
This is OK

612
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,560
It's not Lao Lin

613
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
You said this Gangzi's father Dapeng

614
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,360
I've been following you since liberation

615
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,040
Under your guidance

616
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
Don't work hard, do you

617
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Then you have to say it

618
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,240
I picked him up by hand

619
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,720
That's a good cop

620
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,360
Yeah, you said

621
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,360
He was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution

622
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,520
Leaving Xiulan as an orphan and widowed mother

623
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,520
Although after the downfall of the Gang of Four,

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,880
Rehabilitated by Zhao Xue

625
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,320
The government also takes care of them

626
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,280
That is

627
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
The government still takes good care of us

628
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
This Dapeng died

629
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,480
Actually, I feel the worst

630
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
He is my good brother

631
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Then you said that era

632
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,680
Many good comrades died without cause

633
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,120
All right, now the Gang of Four has been smashed

634
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
I think those spirits can rest in peace, too

635
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,680
Can't rest in peace

636
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,960
Don't say that, Jujube

637
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
I didn't say

638
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
You said Gangzi was the third generation

639
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,920
It takes ten years to cut in line in northern Shaanxi

640
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,560
Now I'm finally back in town

641
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,600
As a result, I didn't even have a job

642
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
Do you think this roc can rest in peace

643
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
I know about Gangzi

644
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,720
But in front of him

645
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,520
There are so many educated youths waiting in line to return to the city like him

646
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
None of them have been solved

647
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,520
You said our neighborhood office

648
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,560
Didn't my sister tell you about this today

649
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,920
I told Lao Lin about this today

650
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
What do you want with me

651
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,400
Returning educated youth to the city to arrange employment

652
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
That's a neighborhood office thing

653
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
What does it have to do with our public security bureau

654
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,760
Why doesn't it matter

655
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,800
Now in society,

656
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,600
There are not many enterprises and institutions

657
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,600
The children of those retired workers

658
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Can you replace it

659
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,120
Is Dapeng your police officer

660
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,640
Or an excellent model police officer

661
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,040
He was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution

662
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
Is a martyr

663
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
Is Gangzi his son

664
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,640
You should go to your police station

665
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,320
Be a cop or something

666
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,240
You can't ignore this anyway

667
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,920
You

668
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,720
This roc died

669
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,760
It's a problem left over from history, right

670
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,320
That Dapeng is my good brother and comrade-in-arms

671
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,280
I have to give him a hand in any way

672
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,320
But now

673
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,360
The public security team recruits new people

674
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,280
That requires a diploma

675
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,360
Gangzi diploma is low

676
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,360
It will definitely not meet the requirements of the country

677
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,080
Then we police officers

678
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
There are no children to replace this saying

679
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,120
So you said let me

680
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
What do I do

681
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,720
That Gangzi diploma is low

682
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,680
It's not his personal reason either

683
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,560
When the child should go to school to study

684
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,480
Didn't you go to repair the earth

685
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,760
How can I have time to learn to read

686
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,520
Jujube

687
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
Don't worry yet

688
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
Can you not be in a hurry

689
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,080
You said our street office couldn't solve it

690
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,480
Their unit has regulations and can't do it

691
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
So you said such a big person

692
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,000
With his daughter-in-law

693
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Staring at each other all day

694
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
Can I not be in a hurry

695
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,360
About Gangzi

696
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,360
It should really be taken care of by the government

697
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,920
But now all enterprises and units

698
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,360
The number of places recruited is particularly small

699
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
Didn't I just say that

700
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,160
Returned educated youth unemployed youth

701
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
A lot of them are waiting in line

702
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,520
Xiulan

703
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,360
Don't be sad

704
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
What about this? I wrote it down

705
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,720
I will find a way as soon as possible

706
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,760
Try to arrange a job for Gangzi as soon as possible

707
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
The Red Tassel Sister

708
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm here to thank you for the baby

709
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,800
You're welcome

710
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll try my best to find a way

711
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,080
Gangzi

712
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,400
Today, your aunt jujube

713
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,880
Take me to Director Hongying's house to talk about you

714
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,080
Director Hongying promised

715
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,160
Say try your best to find a way for you

716
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,320
Then what did my aunt Hong Ying say

717
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,000
When can I go to work

718
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,360
Not that fast

719
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,760
You go to the office every once in a while

720
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,760
In line in front of you like you

721
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Waiting to be arranged

722
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,440
You don't know better than I do

723
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,400
The somebody else red tassel director ah promise me

724
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
Take care of you as much as possible

725
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,920
Give priority to your work

726
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,600
It's been very difficult

727
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,600
Son

728
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,280
Just wait

729
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,280
All right

730
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Me and my daughter-in-law

731
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,240
I finally got back to the city

732
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
But I never thought

733
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,080
Home is back

734
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,200
But now I can't even find a job

735
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,520
The strength of my body

736
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,200
Just cat at home every day

737
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,560
What's it called

738
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,720
Don't deceive you

739
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,760
I'm too embarrassed to open my mouth when I eat now

740
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,520
Son, don't say that

741
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,400
I'm your real mother

742
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,080
No matter how old you are, you are my own son

743
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,080
You can rest assured

744
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,920
As long as there is a bite of mom to eat

745
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,040
I will never let you and your wife go hungry

746
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,560
Mom, I didn't mean that

747
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,000
You see

748
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,560
Gangzi

749
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,920
Why don't you do it like this

750
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,920
Your brother gets off work every night

751
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Everyone goes to the stall to sell enemas

752
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,480
If you really have nothing to do

753
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,920
You give him a hand

754
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,520
Right

755
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Grandpa

756
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,680
He learned the cooking skills from you when he was a child

757
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,520
What can I do? I can't do anything

758
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,720
Nothing, brother

759
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
Just come and give me a hand

760
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,280
Do me a favor

761
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,640
Look at me at ordinary times

762
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,200
Except for selling enemas

763
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,840
What else can I sell, a wallet, a fire or something

764
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Right, isn't it

765
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,560
You go and do Hadron a favor

766
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
Come on

767
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,240
This person who eats fried liver steamed buns and stews

768
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
That's a lot

769
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080
That is

770
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Yao Ji Fried Liver is famous in Beijing

771
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
Can there be not many of these people

772
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,920
It's too tired to eat all the time, isn't it

773
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,800
Thank you for your treat

774
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,440
It cost you money

775
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
As long as you are happy

776
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,120
Dong Zi

777
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
I forgot to say

778
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,640
I met the old seven of Deshengmen that day

779
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,880
He asked me to ask you out

780
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,400
Go to Bayi Lake ballast piano tomorrow

781
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,320
Returning stubble

782
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,240
This has lost us several times

783
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Why don't you have a long memory

784
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah I'm wondering too

785
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,720
You said

786
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,640
Back-back stubble back-back transportation

787
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,480
Whoever loses will treat him to dinner

788
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Please have three or four meals this month

789
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,160
Almost

790
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,360
You said he lost every time

791
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,960
And then invite us to dinner every time

792
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,040
What does he want

793
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,960
What do you care about his plans

794
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,280
Anyway, we'll go when we have an appointment

795
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,560
Fresh air high step

796
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,480
This meal must be inevitable

797
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,400
Don't eat for nothing

798
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,080
Juan, do you think we should go

799
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,280
I don't think old seven is a good person

800
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Every time he looks at people, I feel scared.

801
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,280
Then let's not go

802
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,040
Don't, Dong Zi

803
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,080
It's all agreed that whoever loses will treat

804
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,320
You are missing this meal. You

805
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
It's not about a meal.

806
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,080
Shall we go

807
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Old seven can definitely disperse in four or nine cities

808
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,840
It's not just my face that will fall when the time comes

809
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Your Dong Zi's noodles are gone

810
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,720
Don't go

811
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,920
Who is afraid of who will go to Dong Zi

812
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,880
Since he is a bitch

813
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,040
Let's teach him a good lesson

814
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,120
Win

815
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,720
Blossoms in spring and winds in autumn

816
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,480
And the sunset in winter

817
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,480
The night in the military port is quiet

818
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,720
The waves rocked the warship gently

819
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Young friends come to meet today

820
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,480
Swing the boat and the warm wind blows gently

821
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,279
Send a comrade-in-arms

822
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:26,359
Step on a journey

823
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:30,720
Silent tears

824
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,359
Camel bells rang in my ears

825
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,798
There is no partner to resist

826
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,240
Have no happy mood

827
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,560
Have no qualifications for hobbies

828
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,439
No wings to fly

829
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,278
There is no hope in your life like this

830
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,799
Our depressed workers all know you

831
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,200
Just a good dream will ruin your life

832
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,120
Assi Assi

833
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,839
Assi Assi

834
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,480
Assi Assi

835
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Assi

836
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,920
Assi

837
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,560
OK, Weidong has gone up in the market

838
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
I'm singing Japanese songs

839
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,600
What's the matter? If you don't accept it, you can also have one

840
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,720
I'll serve your uncle

841
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,360
Listen

842
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,360
Laura, why are you

843
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
Roller

844
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,760
Trembling in front of me like that

845
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,080
What can save you now

846
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,600
What can save you now

847
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Just me in front of you

848
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,920
I will put this life

849
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:11,040
This heart and this love are dedicated to you

850
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,600
Roller

851
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,400
Roller

852
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
Roller

853
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Roller

854
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Old seven old seven old seven

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,120
Stop singing, stop singing

856
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,480
I'll choke you back

857
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,360
Gap

858
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
What do you know? You

859
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,920
Hideki Nishicheng sings like this

860
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,600
It's called a roar, you know

861
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,280
Roar

862
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,360
Old seven, stop making fun of it

863
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,640
You really don't call this a roar

864
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,760
You, you call it pinching the chicken's neck and barking

865
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,600
Xicheng Hideki's old man's house

866
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,880
If I hear you sing like this

867
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm telling you

868
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,720
He has to be furious

869
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,840
Dong Zi, who are you squeezing right

870
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,960
Seven, I squeezed you right

871
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,640
What's the matter

872
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,720
Dong Zi, you people in Shichahai are afraid of you

873
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,520
We are not afraid of you in Deshengmen

874
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
Don't challenge me yet

875
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
Refuse to accept single practice

876
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,720
Practice as you practice

877
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,760
Can I give you an arm

878
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Also challenge

879
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,360
Come on, stop arguing

880
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,560
How did you change the ballast frame when you ballast the piano

881
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,320
Juanzi

882
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,760
Today, your seventh brother will give you face and cut him some slack

883
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,560
But you have to promise your brother one thing

884
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
Go dancing with my brother in the evening

885
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,960
Dance with you and dream with you

886
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,840
Seven, don't get tired of me here

887
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,880
Juanzi told you clearly

888
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,840
The reason why I have asked Dong Zi ballast piano for three transgressions and five times

889
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,760
It's all for you

890
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,000
Sister

891
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,280
My brother hasn't missed you for a day or two

892
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,080
If you nod your head,

893
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,600
I promise to let you live

894
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
They are all popular and spicy

895
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,920
Old Seven

896
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,120
You don't pee and see who you are

897
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,680
Eat melon seeds and get a bedbug

898
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,120
Who are you? You

899
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't deserve it

900
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,120
I'll show you today if I deserve it

901
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
My sister goes with my brother

902
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,720
My brother bought you a flower skirt Dacron

903
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,280
You smelly rascal, you

904
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,080
Good boy

905
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,960
Smelly girl film dares to hit me

906
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Juanzi

907
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,840
Gap, gap, gap, I'll go

908
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,560
Wei Dong

909
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,880
Are you all right

910
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,120
Dare to hit me

911
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,240
Dong Zi

912
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,000
Dong Zi

913
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,520
What are you doing stopping

914
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,760
Dong Zi, stop it

915
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,800
Stop

916
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,160
Name

917
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,240
Wei Dong

918
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,880
Your last name is Wei

919
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,440
My last name is not Wei. My last name is Liu. You

920
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,240
Home address

921
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
Don't know

922
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,120
You don't even know where you live

923
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,000
I forgot not to know

924
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,720
Wei, this is the police station

925
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,600
You'd better be honest with me

926
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,840
What happened to the police station

927
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,080
I've seen a lot of cops. Who are you scaring? You

928
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
Listen to your words, old bubble

929
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,720
There is no shortage of police stations

930
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,320
I want you to take care of it

931
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
I'll take care of you today. I

932
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,640
What are you going to do

933
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,120
I told you to touch me

934
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Be careful to make you miserable

935
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,040
I'm still so crazy when I get to the police station

936
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,160
I really haven't seen it

937
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,200
I'd like to see it today

938
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,080
Why are you making me miserable

939
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
Then you touch me and try you

940
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,240
Director, you are just in time

941
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,880
This boy is too rampant

942
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,280
Come out with me for a minute

943
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
Director, he's going to hit me. He

944
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
You stay here and reflect on me

945
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,440
I'll take care of you when I come back

946
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
Director, what do you want me to do

947
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,800
Did you hit him just now

948
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,720
It can't be

949
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,000
Our police are disciplined

950
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
You can't extort a confession by torture

951
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm just trying to scare him

952
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,640
It's a good thing you didn't hit him

953
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,760
Do you know who he is

954
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,680
Who is it

955
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,760
He is the son of Deputy Director Lin Zheng

956
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,560
His name is Lin Weidong

957
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
The son of the forest bureau

958
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,480
I said, why is he so arrogant

959
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,520
What the hell did he do

960
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,320
You've got him

961
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,520
That's true

962
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
We are patrolling near Bayi Lake

963
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,600
Receive reports from the masses

964
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,040
Say it's near Bayi Lake

965
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,080
A gang of children are fighting

966
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,080
We'll be over there

967
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,200
Take a good look

968
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
One arm was twisted

969
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
All the others have hung up

970
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,360
It's very heavy to shoot

971
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,680
Do you have a clear understanding of the situation

972
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,840
I basically understand it

973
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,600
The one whose arm is broken

974
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,560
Nicknamed Lao Qi

975
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,840
Originally, he was with this

976
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
A group of children named Lin Weidong ballast the piano

977
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,200
As a result, in the process of ballast,

978
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,920
Seven flirted with that

979
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,640
A girl named Juanzi who came with Lin Weidong

980
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
When the two groups of people clashed, they started to fight

981
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,360
Who moved the hand first

982
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,440
Old Seven started it first

983
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,920
You have made the situation clear

984
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,920
Get a confession

985
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,440
When I finish reporting to the forestry bureau,

986
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Let's see how to deal with it above

987
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,520
OK

988
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,360
Forestry Bureau

989
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,960
Here's the situation

990
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
It's the old seven. They moved their hands first

991
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,640
Lin Weidong shot too hard when fighting back

992
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,560
Twisted the arm of the old seven

993
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,400
Caused a fracture in the right arm

994
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm still in the hospital

995
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,560
This bastard

996
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,280
Gathering people to fight and hurt people

997
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,600
That's it

998
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,280
Let me make a statement first

999
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,920
Don't care that he is my son

1000
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,640
Everyone is equal before the law

1001
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,200
Do what you have to do

1002
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
This matter, ah

1003
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,440
It is the old seven who flirts with the young women

1004
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,240
And hit people first

1005
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
Lin Weidong is also fighting injustice

1006
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,360
I did it to protect my companions

1007
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,280
But your son is a heavy hand

1008
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,240
Caused harm to the other party

1009
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
This is according to the current law

1010
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,720
It can be cultivated

1011
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,800
How to judge how to judge

1012
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,880
You can't be soft

1013
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,800
After all, the Forestry Bureau has a reason

1014
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,360
If we can do it well

1015
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Work of victims' families

1016
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,960
As long as the other party doesn't pursue it

1017
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,600
We can follow the principle of treating diseases and saving people

1018
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Lin Weidong was given a lighter treatment

1019
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,600
He was sentenced to fifteen days' administrative detention

1020
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,520
As a sign of punishment

1021
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,600
It's too cheap for this boy, isn't it

1022
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,640
If you are really given reeducation through labor,

1023
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,880
The child's future will be ruined

1024
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,360
That

1025
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,360
Do you have the address of the victim's family

1026
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,520
Wait a minute. You can write it down

1027
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,120
Just a moment

1028
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
You said

1029
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,760
Lao Lin

1030
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,400
Lao Lin

1031
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,080
How is it

1032
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,600
What can I do

1033
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,520
Your son broke a man's arm

1034
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,720
It took a few more

1035
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,120
What do you say you can do

1036
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,960
You won't be sentenced to upbringing, will you

1037
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,360
The sentence is light

1038
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Should be sentenced to heavy punishment
