1
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,200
Did Tiedan see Luo Wenhui

2
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,000
No

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,080
No one came out

4
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,320
Go

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,480
Go

6
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,600
Lao Wu

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Section chief

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
Luo Wenhui ran away from here

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
I've already sent someone to chase it

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,880
This Luo Wenhui is too cunning

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,600
Arrange the back road for yourself early

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Chase

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,120
Go

14
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Where did the man run

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,480
I have no idea

16
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,320
Chief, when we came after him

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,160
I looked around

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,680
No trace of Luo Wenhui was found

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
This Luo Wenhui is too cunning

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,720
Elder sister

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,560
Elder sister

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,600
In the middle of the night

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Why are you looking for me in a hurry

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,600
Brother Iron Egg didn't leave

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
He still sells vegetables over the overpass

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,440
Who told you

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,440
Today, Xiaofeng and I went to Kongsan Wrestling Ground

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
I gave it to him as a trustee

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,240
Fool those wrestlers to throw money at him

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,440
It doesn't matter

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,840
The point is

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
So Kong San is happy today

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,680
He invited us brothers to drink

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
While drinking

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,920
This Kong San also asked me to be his apprentice with him

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,200
Sister, can we promise this

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
I said at the time

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,320
To be an apprentice is also to be Brother Iron Egg

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
I also squeezed Kong San and said

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,240
He is the defeated man of Brother Iron Egg

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,920
As a result, his apprentice said not to mention Brother Iron Egg

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
Said Brother Iron Egg is now mixed up in

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,160
Take the burden and sell vegetables on the streets of Tianqiao

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
I'll just say he's talking nonsense

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,080
How is that possible

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,800
But Kong San said it

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,480
He saw it really during the day today

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Is Brother Iron Egg

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
Still carrying a dish

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
Selling vegetables over the overpass

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
What you said is true, isn't it

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
Sister, can I still lie to you

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
I put down my glass and came to you

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Go

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,320
Walking sister

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
Tomorrow is the celebration

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
If you can't catch Luo Wenhui,

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
We are sinners of the country

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
What

60
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
See the iron egg

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
It's just over the overpass

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,120
Said he is carrying the burden to sell vegetables now

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Sell vegetables

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,120
Elder sister

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I doubt that iron egg

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,880
You can't be doing something there, can you

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,600
Jujube

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
This clue you provided is too important

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Go and report to your brother Lin

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,880
I'm not going

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm going to go to your own place

72
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,800
What's wrong with you

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,519
He reused the bad man

74
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,320
I'm not happy to go anyway

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Tian Zao, what time is it

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Come with me. Come on

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Go

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,760
The child

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,200
Iron eggs appear on the overpass

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
And disguised as a vegetable seller

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Jujube, this is terrible

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,080
Why

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
The celebration will begin tomorrow

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,240
Xiannongtan has this celebration

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
Tianqiao is the leader

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,640
The only place to go to Xiannongtan

87
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
Iron egg suspected of being a major spy

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
Appeared in the flyover area at this time

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
I have to report to my superior immediately

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
This situation is too serious

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Chief, we have turned around several times

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,880
This Luo Wenhui doesn't even have a picture

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,360
This Luo Wenhui is like a fox

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,640
Be very cunning

95
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
He should already know we're after him

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
He will never show up again before he acts

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,960
If you want to catch him before he moves,

98
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,160
It's so hard

99
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,360
There are so many streets along the way

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
Such a big place

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,120
Where will Luo Wenhui start

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,840
How could I forget this crop

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,960
What's the matter, Chief

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,360
Immediately arraign Liang Liqun

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,120
Yes

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,840
The surname Liang

107
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
You give me an account right now

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
Celebration day

109
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,280
Where were you ordered to do it

110
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,720
Sir, why can't I understand

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
What are you talking about

112
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,480
Don't play dumb for me here

113
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
You are the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
A spy sent by Mao Renfeng

115
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Sneaked into Peiping to cooperate with Luo Wenhui

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,120
Assassinate the leader of our party

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,520
Your mission is to create chaos

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,360
Cooperate with Luo Wenhui to complete the task

119
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
What Tam Fai

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
What assassination

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,360
I don't know

122
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm not a spy either

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
You've got the wrong guy

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,960
There is only one dead end to stubborn resistance

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,280
You think you don't say

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,400
We don't know, do we

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
I told you the last name is Liang

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,720
We have already found out all the details of you

129
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,480
Carry it, right

130
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,800
I'd like to see how long you carry it

131
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,000
Instructor Sun, why are you here

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,200
Guqing, since I'm already sitting here,

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
I told you clearly

134
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm an undercover agent sent by the Communist Party

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,840
Do I have to go on

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Instructor Sun

137
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
I don't want to die

138
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Please, please, please help me

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,800
Get up, get up

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
You listen now

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,640
You're the only one who can save you

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
As long as you answer my question

143
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
You still have a chance

144
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
Let me ask you something

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,880
The Secrecy Bureau instructed you and Liang

146
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,320
Where to start on the day of the Communist Party celebration

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,400
I said I would say anything

148
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,240
I said

149
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
I told you

150
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Comrades

151
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,960
We know for sure now

152
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,760
Luo Wenhui's hands-on area

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,440
Tomorrow is when we arrest Luo Wenhui

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
Last chance

155
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Our superiors gave us a dead order

156
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,960
Killing pistols can be pulled out

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,400
But never let his bullets come out

158
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Comrades

159
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
If his bullets come out

160
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,400
You know what this means

161
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,559
Defend the Party Central Committee to the Death

162
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,800
Defend the Party Central Committee to the Death

163
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,319
Defend the Party Central Committee to the Death

164
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,960
Defend the Party Central Committee to the Death

165
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,200
Jujube

166
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,120
How's the chief

167
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,320
I have reported to this superior leader

168
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
What about the superior leaders

169
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,720
Attach great importance to this clue

170
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,480
But catching this assassination leader

171
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
What about the spy case

172
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,880
Under the responsibility of the Central Ministry of Social Affairs

173
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
Our public security bureau is just helping

174
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,120
Do some screening work

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,680
What about the specific situation

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
The city bureau leaders are not very clear either

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
They have reported it to the relevant departments

178
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,600
Jujube in this field

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,880
You go home first

180
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll let you know if there is any news

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Chief, if this iron egg is really

182
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,000
A spy who assassinated important leaders

183
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,400
I can't live

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,760
Xiaozao, don't worry

185
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
It's no use worrying

186
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,880
No

187
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
I have to keep looking for it

188
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
It's getting dark on this day

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,320
Where are you going to find it

190
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
I have plenty of people

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
I can start the children to find it together

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,520
I won't find it tonight

193
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
I'll go to Tianqiao Street tomorrow and look for it

194
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
You can rest assured that once I find him,

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm sure he'll get it back

196
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Jujube

197
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,760
Jujube

198
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,160
Forget it

199
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,480
You can't stop it if you want to

200
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,120
But what Xiaozao said may be a good way

201
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,640
She and her kids know Iron Egg

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,040
It is possible to provide clues as soon as possible

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
How's it going? Did you find it

204
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,320
No

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,720
Keep looking

206
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,400
Elder sister

207
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,880
Stop looking

208
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Go home

209
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,880
Sister Iron Egg sells vegetables during the day

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Where can I find him this big night

211
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,280
Looking for

212
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
If you can't find it, you won't go back today

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Have you seen Liang Liqun and them

214
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
I didn't see it

215
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,520
Leave them alone

216
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Remember, be smart

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
The motorcade is coming soon

218
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Everybody split up

219
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
See the unkempt and bearded

220
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,080
Whether it's Luo Wenhui or not

221
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's control it first

222
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,720
Quickly

223
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes

224
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes

225
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,560
Go

226
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,520
Iron egg over

227
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,600
Excuse me

228
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,480
Excuse me

229
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,240
Excuse me

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,480
This comrade

231
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
You wait a minute

232
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,600
Jujube

233
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,520
Why are you here

234
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,280
Why am I here

235
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Catch him. He is Luo Wenhui

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,280
Quickly

237
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,560
Jujube

238
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,120
Take away

239
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Take away

240
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,080
Let go of me

241
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,800
Go

242
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,000
I said sister

243
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
What's going on here?

244
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,560
You ask me and I'll ask who will go

245
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,320
Make way, make way, make way

246
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,920
Where are the iron eggs

247
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,640
Chase

248
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Go

249
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Long live the Communist Party

250
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,680
Long live the Communist Party

251
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,480
Long live the Communist Party

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
Long live the Communist Party

253
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,160
What about Big Brother

254
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,240
Long live the Communist Party

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,480
Withdraw

256
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
Long live the Communist Party

257
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,560
Long live the Communist Party

258
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,520
Long live the Communist Party

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,080
Long live Chairman Mao

260
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,920
Long live the Communist Party

261
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
Long live the Communist Party

262
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,200
Long live Chairman Mao

263
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,920
Long live the Communist Party

264
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Long live the Communist Party

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,240
Long live Chairman Mao

266
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Long live the Communist Party

267
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
Long live the Communist Party

268
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,240
Long live the Communist Party

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,320
Long live the Communist Party

270
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,000
Long live Chairman Mao

271
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,480
Don't move

272
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,960
Don't move

273
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,040
Take away

274
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,000
Lao Wu

275
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,680
Wait a minute

276
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,040
What to do

277
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Lin Zheng of our branch office

278
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,960
Which one of you

279
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,640
The Ministry of Social Affairs performs official duties

280
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:25,920
Go away

281
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,760
Go away

282
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,640
Go

283
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,000
1947

284
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Comrade Sun Tie

285
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,320
By the Urban Industry Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

286
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,160
Development of underground party organizations in Beiping

287
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,480
Join the revolutionary ranks

288
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,560
What about 1948

289
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,560
Appointed by the underground party in Beiping

290
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
With the characteristics of his martial arts,

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Sneaked into the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

292
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,520
The spy training agency set up in Peiping

293
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,160
Serve as an instructor

294
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,200
And trusted by the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

295
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,120
Stayed in Peiping as a latent spy

296
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,760
In this assassination of Kuomintang spies,

297
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,600
Comrade Sun Tie has completed

298
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
The undercover task given to him by the party

299
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,840
Acquired the number one killer of the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

300
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
Important information of Luo Wenhui

301
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
So let's take it at a critical time

302
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,480
Uncovered the assassination case of Kuomintang spies

303
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,120
And captured Luo Wenhui alive

304
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
In this operation,

305
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
It is fully proved that

306
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,840
Comrade Sun Tie is a loyal revolutionary fighter of our party

307
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
Because Comrade Sun Tie has a special status

308
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
He was directly affected by

309
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,360
Leadership of the Social Department of the CPC Central Committee

310
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,160
So I didn't inform the local government

311
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
What about at work

312
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
Bring a lot of trouble to everyone

313
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Please also ask the comrades in the sub-bureau to understand more

314
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Understanding

315
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
This is completely understood

316
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,640
But I really didn't expect this comrade Sun Tie

317
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,240
There is such a strange experience

318
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,080
That's great

319
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,840
Jujube knows that he must be overjoyed

320
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
This is the whole situation

321
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,440
Jujube

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,960
I am a hero who has made great contributions to the party

323
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,960
You can't scold me this time, can you

324
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,920
You are a complete bastard

325
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,560
Not dates

326
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,720
What are you, what are you crazy about

327
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm I'm crazy

328
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,280
I was driven crazy by you bastard

329
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm telling you, you can't fool around

330
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,640
I am a revolutionary fighter now

331
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm a Communist

332
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,880
The surname Sun

333
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm telling you

334
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,560
From now on

335
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,120
I will never see you again

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,640
You should be your Communist Party

337
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,240
Jujube

338
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,680
Jujube

339
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,000
Jujube

340
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,600
Jujube

341
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
What's going on here

342
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,640
Jujube, listen to me

343
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,880
Comrade Tiedan is a soldier on the hidden front

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,640
He is carrying out the special task assigned to him by the party

345
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,680
The Party has iron discipline

346
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,160
There is nothing wrong with him doing so

347
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,640
He's not wrong

348
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
Then I was wrong

349
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,840
No, sister, you give me a reason.

350
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,120
I grew up with that Sun

351
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Childhood sweetheart

352
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,640
He is my father's apprentice

353
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
My parents entrusted me to him when they left

354
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,000
He can say that in this world

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,960
With the people I'm closest to

356
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,800
He is an underground party

357
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,480
I was not informed of such an important matter

358
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,920
One deception is two years

359
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
What does he take my dates for

360
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
Be an enemy

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,440
What is more exasperating

362
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
What is even more exasperating is that

363
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,320
I did it for him

364
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,680
Be anxious to get angry and have a high fever

365
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I almost died

366
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,560
What about him

367
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,400
Go on a mission

368
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,760
I also made contributions and became a hero

369
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Hippie smiling and telling me in front of me

370
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
Said I scolded him wrong

371
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,880
Sister, do you know what my mood was at that time

372
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,000
I just feel like I'm a simpleton and a big fool

373
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,760
Okay, okay, don't get excited

374
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,320
Jujube, as I said just now

375
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,000
Iron Egg did this as a last resort

376
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
The party has a confidentiality discipline

377
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
What discipline

378
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
I don't know what discipline is

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,960
All I know is that

380
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,560
The Communist Party is also a human being and should talk about human feelings

381
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,080
You can't deny your six relatives, can you

382
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,040
Jujube, aren't you making trouble without reason

383
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,280
Be reasonable in life

384
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,280
Elder sister

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,080
You have your reasons

386
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,120
My field jujube has the reason of my field jujube

387
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
I don't know the rest

388
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,880
I only know one thing

389
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
His surname Sun doesn't have me in his heart

390
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
He broke my Tian Zao's heart

391
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,320
The child

392
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,000
Jujube iron eggs have been waiting for you for a long time

393
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,840
Jujube

394
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm here to make amends. I'm here

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
The fault was mine

396
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
Don't be mad at me

397
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,000
Not leaving, right? You're not leaving, are you

398
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,320
You boy, are you not leaving

399
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,640
What's the matter? Don't hit people

400
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,120
What's going on, Jujube

401
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,920
Don't fight, don't fight

402
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Are you all right, iron egg

403
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,600
Jujube

404
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,640
Look at this child

405
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,640
What's going on here

406
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,440
Yeah

407
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,640
Why do you think you laid such a heavy hand?

408
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,560
You said this kid

409
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,960
Brother Tiedan, how did you offend my sister Zao

410
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,960
Are you all right

411
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,920
Iron egg

412
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,520
You came to me to complain

413
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,080
Red Tassel Sister

414
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,760
I thought

415
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,560
She knows that I am an underground party

416
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,040
Can jump with joy

417
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,320
But I never thought

418
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,920
I can't believe she turned against me

419
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,800
Even if she hits me, forget it

420
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,040
She also said

421
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,040
She also said never to see her again

422
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
I just didn't tell her the truth

423
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,400
Coco, I have to obey the party discipline, too

424
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,680
I can't even tell my father and mother

425
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,760
Iron egg

426
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
Such a fierce reaction to jujube

427
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
I didn't understand it at first

428
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
Later, after a conversation with her,

429
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,560
I think instead

430
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
If she hadn't reacted so much

431
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
She wouldn't be Tian Zao

432
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
Why do you say that

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Look at that

434
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
Xiao Zao is a person. She is very kind

435
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Dare to love and hate

436
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,560
Is an extremely simple girl

437
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
What about doing things? One track-minded

438
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,080
According to one's own likes and dislikes

439
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,400
But Jujube, she can't read big characters

440
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
Uneducated flat-headed people

441
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,720
So for these principles,

442
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
And the discipline of our party

443
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,800
That's completely confusing

444
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
It's impossible to understand

445
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
But in Xiaozao's heart,

446
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,240
You are the closest person to her

447
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
She put the happiness of her life

448
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,760
It's all entrusted to you

449
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Never expected

450
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,360
You lied to her

451
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,680
This is something she can't accept under any circumstances

452
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,360
I talked with Xiaozao for a long time

453
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,720
But she won't listen at all

454
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
When he left,

455
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Give me a word back

456
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,480
What did she say

457
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
She said

458
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,720
Iron egg doesn't have me at all

459
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,400
And said you broke her heart

460
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,760
Listen to a word from my sister

461
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,360
Don't go looking for her for a while

462
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
She is angry now

463
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,280
You go find her

464
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,680
On the contrary, it backfires and intensifies contradictions

465
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,680
Let her think calmly for herself

466
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,520
I'll do her ideological work again

467
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
When she figured it out for herself one day

468
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,000
You may make up as before

469
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,960
Red Tassel Sister

470
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,120
Jujube hates me so much now

471
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,080
Trying to get her to forgive me

472
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,600
It's really hard

473
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
Luo Wenhui

474
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
The number one killer of the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

475
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,040
I've heard a lot about it

476
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920
You're welcome

477
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,160
Tell me about it

478
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,640
Who did you meet with when you came to Peiping

479
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,720
Who is responsible for arranging your hiding place

480
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
This officer

481
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,840
Do you think

482
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Will I answer the questions you ask

483
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,600
Luo Wenhui

484
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,440
Come here

485
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,040
You still don't tell me your problems honestly

486
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I've never lost my hand in Luo Wenhui

487
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,160
This time in the hands of your Communist Party

488
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I admit to planting

489
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't know much

490
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,640
You arrested me in the street

491
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
Those colleagues who cooperated with my action

492
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,000
Has long been a frightened bird

493
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,720
Even if I tell you who they are

494
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,320
You'll never catch them again

495
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,960
It's our business whether we can catch it or not

496
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
It's your business to say it or not

497
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,720
But I still hope you have a good attitude

498
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
Have meritorious service

499
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,680
Strive for leniency from the government

500
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,560
It's late

501
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,560
My hands

502
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,160
Stained with too much blood of your Communists

503
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,880
No matter what I do now

504
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
It's all a dead end

505
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
But

506
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
Before you shoot me

507
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,720
I have a request

508
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,120
What request

509
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,040
I want to meet someone

510
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,520
Meet someone

511
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,120
That's the one on the street

512
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
The man who identified me

513
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,440
Why do you want to see him

514
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,000
As for why

515
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,520
I'll talk about it when I see him

516
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
There are so many people in the street

517
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
How did you recognize me

518
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,240
Because you have a streak

519
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,080
The stink of not taking a bath for several days

520
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,400
The condition of the flyover is really poor

521
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,120
I dare not go to the bathhouse to take a bath

522
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,960
It's hard to wash your face

523
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,320
Careless

524
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,200
Even if you wash it clean,

525
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Skynet is slow but not leaking

526
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,800
You can't escape the palms of the people

527
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
One last question

528
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,880
What's your name

529
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,760
Sun Tie

530
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Powerful

531
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
You can shoot me now

532
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,600
People's Republic of China

533
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Central People's government

534
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,680
Established today

535
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,200
Neighbors

536
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Listen to us all

537
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,960
Our street government will be elected soon

538
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,320
Street activists

539
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,560
I hope everyone will participate enthusiastically

540
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,640
To our candidate

541
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,600
Go to the polls

542
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Sign up and vote enthusiastically

543
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Li government

544
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,760
What kind of official is this street activist

545
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,880
What kind of official is this street activist

546
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,640
Uncles and aunts

547
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,240
This street activist is not an official

548
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,560
All the candidates

549
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,760
They are all our ordinary people

550
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,800
Choose them out

551
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
Is to serve everyone

552
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,520
That's right

553
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,480
On the list of candidates announced

554
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,440
It's all written

555
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,560
These people live in this neighborhood

556
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,160
It's not a jujube. She's on this list.

557
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,520
She is also a candidate

558
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a candidate, too

559
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,640
Dear uncles, aunts and aunts

560
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,400
If you can trust me, Tian Zao

561
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,680
Just give me a vote

562
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,360
I will definitely give my life to do things for everyone

563
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
Good

564
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,520
We believe in you, we believe in you

565
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,240
Tian Zao, we believe you, we believe

566
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,920
Wait, wait

567
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Tomorrow, the street government polling station will vote

568
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
The one who is divided by head

569
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,960
Anyone over sixteen can vote

570
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,320
Cast my field jujube

571
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
Good

572
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,840
Definitely vote

573
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
Listen to me, aunts and grandfathers

574
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,920
Definitely vote, definitely vote, definitely vote

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
It doesn't matter if you can't write your name

576
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,920
Just sign up at the front

577
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,160
It's ok to say the first name to you

578
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,840
All in line

579
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,200
Have you seen it all

580
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,520
This is me

581
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You're done, aren't you

582
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,480
What is your name

583
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,960
Star

584
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Good star

585
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Come

586
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Just vote here

587
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,400
Thank you

588
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,800
Write here. You write for me

589
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,040
You have to line up when you come in

590
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,240
This row

591
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,840
Come

592
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,120
This way

593
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,600
Just write it here

594
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,120
OK

595
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,880
This is me

596
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,880
I cast Tian Zao

597
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
You can't write it, can you

598
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,320
Can't write

599
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,880
Vote for you

600
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,800
Aunt, what's your name

601
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,960
My name is Huang Meihua

602
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,880
Jujube has been tired all day

603
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,400
Sit down

604
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,320
I'll pour you a glass of water to drink

605
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,600
Sister, I'll do it. I'll do it

606
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,320
No need

607
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,960
I'll do it

608
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Look at your child

609
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
New China was founded

610
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,080
I can't finish my energy.

611
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Sit down, sit down

612
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,480
Jujube

613
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,120
I really didn't expect it

614
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
The neighbors like you so much

615
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,960
That's not true

616
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,600
I was an orphan and grew up eating a hundred meals

617
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,680
All the neighbors in this neighborhood are my grandparents

618
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
Uncle, aunt, big brother and big sister

619
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
They are all very kind to me

620
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,600
Elder sister

621
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,920
Street activists in this election

622
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,640
You have to have my share anyway

623
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
You have such a good mass base

624
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,640
I guess it will be difficult for you not to be elected

625
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,600
That's great

626
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Then I can finally give it to my neighbors

627
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,320
Do something practical

628
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,120
I also hope you can join in

629
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
So I don't just have a good sister

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
You can also have a good helper

631
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
Sister, you can rest assured

632
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,440
I may have done it

633
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,360
Don't boast about yourself so much

634
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,960
You must learn to be modest

635
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,400
To modesty

636
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,080
Jujube, have you contacted Comrade Tiedan recently

637
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,280
Not sister

638
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,160
How are you? Why do you mention him?

639
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,640
I don't want to know the current situation of Comrade Tiedan

640
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,640
Don't want to know

641
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,240
Good

642
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
You don't want to know this

643
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,560
I have to tell you, too

644
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,920
The former Ministry of Social Affairs where Comrade Tiedan was located

645
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Has been merged into the Ministry of Public Security

646
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,600
Because of his excellent completion

647
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,840
The task assigned to him by the party

648
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,320
Has entered the second division of the city security department

649
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,400
Became a police officer

650
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,000
Became a police officer

651
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,160
He can be whatever he wants to be

652
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,360
It has nothing to do with me

653
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,120
Comrade Xiaozao has a hard mouth of ducks

654
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,080
You're cracking your teeth

655
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,600
According to Liang Liqun in custody,

656
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,600
Since he and Gu Qing sneaked into Beijing,

657
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,480
Mainly connected with them

658
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,920
It's the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau

659
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,880
Important person in charge of Beijing Railway Station

660
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,240
Code name Night Wolf

661
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,640
After Luo Wenhui was arrested,

662
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,640
Enemy spy organizations launched one after another

663
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,480
The activities that sabotaged my founding ceremony

664
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,760
They were all cracked by our public security system one by one

665
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,960
In this way

666
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,120
To the enemy spy organization lurking in Beijing

667
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,360
With a heavy blow

668
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,800
So far

669
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,480
Some Kuomintang spies including night wolves

670
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,160
They are all dormant

671
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,040
Comrades

672
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,800
Although the arrogance of the enemy

673
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,240
We suppressed it

674
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,680
But at present, we in Beijing

675
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,080
Latent underground radio station

676
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,440
Activities are still very frequent

677
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,200
They keep changing passwords

678
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,040
To our police surveillance department

679
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,520
Cause great difficulties

680
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,120
And we are looking for radio equipment here now

681
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,120
Still very backward

682
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,240
So our work is progressing very slowly

683
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,520
Fortunately

684
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,080
Our local governments

685
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,480
Has been stepped up to improve

686
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,120
Establish grass-roots mass organizations

687
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,240
Again, the same sentence

688
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Mobilize the masses and rely on the masses

689
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,560
Fight this national war well

690
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,080
Those lurking spies

691
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,120
It will surface sooner or later

692
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,320
Come back

693
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,720
Jujube sister

694
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
Have you eaten yet

695
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,720
No

696
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,080
Just in time, there are fish today

697
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,280
Just leave it at our house

698
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,720
That's nice

699
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,280
I'll help you choose

700
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,080
Come on, come on, come on

701
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,920
Zaojie chose street activists this time

702
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,560
Then we all voted for you

703
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
Thank you, Sister Shirley

704
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,800
When did you say polite words to us

705
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,600
It's not like you

706
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Sister Hongying said it

707
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,080
People should know how to be modest

708
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,520
Zaoxing also knows that modesty is not easy

709
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,600
Why don't you say it? Follow our Communist Party

710
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,640
Really make progress

711
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,960
Uncle, I still have a long way to go

712
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
We have to learn more

713
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,720
Sister Zao, can you be elected this time

714
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,280
Can you get rid of the word "can"

715
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,720
Sister Hongying said it all

716
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,680
Neighbors like me so much

717
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,280
It's hard for me to be a jujube without wanting to be it

718
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,040
It's really hard

719
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
This means that you are fat and you can catch your breath

720
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,600
Who spoke modestly just now

721
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,160
Who is it

722
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,160
Right, forget

723
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Jujube

724
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,600
You become a street activist

725
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
Work for the government

726
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,680
That's a good thing

727
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,480
Finally, you have a wish

728
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah

729
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,120
But when did you

730
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,440
I gave my aunt's wish

731
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,560
Aunt, what do you wish for

732
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,160
You forgot

733
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,679
What you told me

734
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,120
You made a deal with Iron Egg

735
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,159
You two got married as soon as New China was founded

736
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,798
This is now the founding of New China

737
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,959
It's good for you two

738
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,080
So that no one can see anyone

739
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,160
Make it look like an enemy

740
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,159
Don't you tell me about him

741
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,600
Why can't you mention it

742
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:27,759
I just mentioned

743
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,400
What a big deal

744
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,520
Besides

745
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,560
I think people did the right thing with iron eggs

746
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,359
You are too small-minded

747
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,679
I think your aunt is right

748
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,960
Jujube is just your big heart with a big needle nose

749
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,278
How can I work for my neighbors after that

750
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,720
You just listen to your uncle

751
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,119
Make up with Iron Egg

752
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,919
The marriage was done in a slippery way

753
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,440
Do you think so

754
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm not going to look for him

755
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,798
You know what, Jujube

756
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,119
What if you're embarrassed to tell Brother Iron Egg

757
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,318
Then I'll help you say it

758
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,920
Don't go looking for him

759
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
You go find him. I'm in a hurry with you

760
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,720
The child pays back endlessly

761
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,520
Aren't you afraid of iron eggs falling in love with others

762
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,720
When the time comes, if the iron egg ignores you,

763
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,720
You should be in a hurry

764
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,880
He'd better leave me alone forever

765
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,840
Hurry to like others

766
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,880
Who wants it

767
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,400
I said you child

768
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,320
I think you belong to ducks

769
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,080
Hard mouth

770
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,280
Why do you say I belong to ducks

771
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,440
What a coincidence? Isn't this

772
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,240
Heartless and heartless

773
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,560
I can still laugh

774
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Good director, good director

775
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Lao Lin

776
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,520
Red tassel

777
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,040
It's getting cold and it's autumn

778
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,280
Why don't you come in and find me

779
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,480
I'm always looking for you for fear of bad influence

780
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,240
Red tassel

781
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,800
Tell you a good news

782
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,680
What news

783
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,920
Our marriage application

784
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,880
Organizationally approved

785
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,560
Really

786
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
I will have a wife in the future

787
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,480
I can be with you honestly

788
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Finally waiting for this day

789
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll discuss it with you

790
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
We'll get this certificate in a couple of days

791
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,560
Call all the comrades in arms

792
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
Let's get the marriage done

793
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,360
What's the rush

794
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm organizing the streets right now

795
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,080
Election activists

796
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,440
When this paragraph is finished,

797
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,880
The election results came out

798
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,480
It's not too late for us to get married

799
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,720
All right, listen to you

800
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,680
That's right

801
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Jujube is very likely to be selected this time

802
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,600
Don't be too happy

803
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,240
Even if this jujube is chosen,

804
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,720
It may not be good for you

805
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,800
You said you

806
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,120
I said, why do you despise Ueda jujube so much

807
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,040
This girl is too wild

808
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,160
And no culture

809
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,600
I don't know anything about politics

810
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,560
You say people like this

811
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,760
How can it be absorbed

812
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,520
From the revolutionary organizations

813
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,640
But she has a mass base

814
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,520
Have great enthusiasm for work and outstanding ability

815
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,360
Have infinite love for the party

816
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
We don't absorb such people into the organization

817
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,360
Reuse

818
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,840
Then what kind of people should we use

819
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,160
OK, I won't argue with you

820
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Let's wait and see

821
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,840
Let's go

822
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
Today is the organization approving us

823
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,440
A good wedding day

824
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
Find a place to celebrate

825
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,880
Go

826
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,280
Good

827
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't touch it. You can't afford it.

828
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,120
I'll do it myself

829
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,840
What are you doing, you stinking shabby you

830
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,280
Don't you dare flirt with girls here if you have no money

831
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,840
No

832
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
And you crawled in through the back window

833
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
You have grown your skill, you ask for three

834
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,640
Walk

835
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,240
Brother Suo

836
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,760
Walk aside and go

837
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,480
I also posted that you should be shameless.

838
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,920
No beating in New China

839
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,120
What happened to New China

840
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
I care about my own daughter

841
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,440
Does it work

842
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,880
I bah

843
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,760
Who is your daughter

844
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,520
I bah

845
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,800
How is she not my daughter

846
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
She sold her to me

847
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
She is my daughter

848
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,280
Suo San

849
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,600
You have to look distressed

850
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,640
Redeem it

851
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
Dogs see people low

852
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,560
You wait

853
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,480
Sooner or later, I will redeem her

854
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,360
I really don't look down on you, Suo San

855
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
Just like you

856
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,040
You want to redeem Chunxi

857
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,880
Old

858
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,440
Fuck off

859
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,040
Walk, walk

860
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,640
Brother Suo, go back early

861
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,320
Waiting for brother

862
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,840
Waiting for my brother to redeem you

863
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,600
Fuck off

864
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm waiting for you

865
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,280
Don't you want to know the latest situation of Iron Egg

866
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
Don't want to know

867
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,480
You don't want to know this

868
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,400
I have to tell you, too

869
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,720
The former Ministry of Social Affairs where Comrade Tiedan was located

870
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,320
Has been merged into the Ministry of Public Security

871
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
Because of his outstanding accomplishment of the party's tasks,

872
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,320
Has entered the second division of the city security department

873
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,400
Became a police officer

874
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
He can be whatever he wants to be

875
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,000
It has nothing to do with me

876
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,800
Comrade Xiaozao has a hard mouth of ducks

877
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,640
I think people did the right thing with iron eggs

878
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,480
You are too small-minded

879
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,440
As far as you are concerned, you have a big needle nose

880
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,760
How can I work for my neighbors after that

881
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,280
You just listen to your uncle

882
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,680
Make up with Iron Egg

883
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,280
The marriage was done in a slippery way

884
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,440
What if you're embarrassed to tell Brother Iron Egg

885
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,680
Then I'll help you say it

886
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
Don't go looking for him

887
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,400
You go find him. I'm in a hurry with you

888
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,080
The child is endless.

889
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
Aren't you afraid of iron eggs falling in love with others

890
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,040
When the time comes, if the iron egg ignores you,

891
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,000
You should be in a hurry

892
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,880
Smelly iron egg

893
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,360
You don't really like someone else, do you

894
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,840
Jujube

895
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,360
When will you ever forgive me

896
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,320
Is that your iron egg brother in coal core

897
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,200
Yes, brother iron egg, why doesn't he go in

898
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,800
He left when he saw us

899
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,800
You said that this iron egg and your jujube sister

900
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,120
These two people are very interesting

901
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,360
These two people are so wasted

902
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,800
See who consumes who

903
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,960
Go

904
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,320
Sister, I'm back

905
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,960
Come back

906
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Wash up and sleep

907
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,200
I saw Brother Iron Egg outside

908
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,000
I really saw it

909
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,640
Then I can still read it wrong

910
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,480
Elder sister, brother iron egg, he has

911
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,920
You smelly coal core

912
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,280
There's no one out there

913
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
There is no iron egg brother

914
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,280
My master and I really saw Brother Iron Egg

915
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,800
He's under your window and his hair is stunned

916
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,440
But as soon as he saw us coming, he turned and ran away

917
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,120
I haven't finished talking to you yet

918
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
You just went out

919
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,000
No

920
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,240
He came and came

921
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,240
What are you running for

922
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,480
I don't know

923
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,400
But my master said

924
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,840
What did your master say

925
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,160
My master said

926
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,120
You two are really interesting

927
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,120
And said let you two just waste it

928
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
See who can consume more energy than who

929
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,880
Don't believe me, Suo Qian can't earn money

930
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,720
Chun Xi

931
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
I have to redeem you

932
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,880
Don't you ask for it

933
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Gong Er Ge Liu San Di

934
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,960
Suo Ye Suo Ye

935
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,160
Why are you two
