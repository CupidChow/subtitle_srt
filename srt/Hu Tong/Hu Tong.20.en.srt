1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,400
This woman likes Dongzi 100%

2
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,400
Why else would she come all the way to Beijing

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
You don't even know how close they are

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,720
I like her as much as I do.

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Not to mention those smelly men

6
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
Sister, if you don't think of a way about this

7
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,960
Lin Weidong really became someone else's

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,440
Wei Dong

9
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,240
Would you

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
Xiaomin, why did you come back

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,960
What's wrong with Aunt Lan

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,920
Your dad had a stroke

13
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,760
He is being rescued in the hospital now

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,920
Mom

15
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,880
How is my dad

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
Your dad this morning

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,040
When you take your apprentice to practice wrestling,

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
I got my head stuck on the ground

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
He was sent to the hospital

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
When we get here,

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
He's already in the O.R.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
You said the Iron Egg Brothers

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,680
Practice martial arts all your life

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
How can such a good body suddenly

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Why don't you say a few words less

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Mom, it's okay

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
It's gonna be all right

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
That

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,400
You're here

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Go back to rest early

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,840
I'll withdraw first

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Dong Ge

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
I will go back to Guangzhou tomorrow

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,120
Tonight is my last day in Beijing

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,840
Why don't you just leave

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Xiaoli

37
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,920
It's like this

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,480
It's my pleasure that you like me.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Thank you

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,520
But I already have someone I like in my heart

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
You have someone you like

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,440
Right

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,600
Who is it

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Is a

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,600
Someone who makes me worth loving all my life

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,240
Juanzi, you really said it

47
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,680
Dong Zi is really here

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,320
What about that? What about that

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,560
Hurry up, Dong Zi

50
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
What are you two doing here

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,120
What's the matter

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Dong Zi Xiaomin's father suffered a stroke

53
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,560
In the hospital for rescue

54
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's go. Let's go

55
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,440
Quickly

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Quick pedal

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,560
Xiaomin

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,720
Jujube aunt

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,000
Jujube aunt

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,600
How's Uncle Iron Egg

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,360
How is it

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,440
I don't know this old thing

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
Can you get through this

64
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,040
Mom

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,000
It's okay

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,880
My Uncle Iron Egg is a good man

67
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
God will take care of him

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,240
Right

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
The lights went out

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,880
Mom

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,200
Doctor, how is my dad

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,200
Fortunately, it was delivered in time

73
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
The patient was rescued

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
But it is not out of danger yet

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
Need hospitalization for observation

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
What disease does he have

77
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,480
Acute thrombosis

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,640
What about the surgery

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,280
The condition has been alleviated

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Fortunately, the patient's physical quality is better

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,480
As long as you make it through tonight

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
You can get out of danger

83
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,080
As for whether there will be sequelae in the future

84
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
It depends on the later treatment

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
And the patient's recovery

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,880
Finish

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,440
This is not good. You have to play Killer for the rest of your life

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,160
Right

89
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,400
If you don't talk, you can be sold as dumb

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,480
Sister Zao, don't worry

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
Brother Iron Egg will survive

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Thank you, Doctor

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Thank you, thank you

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Thank you thank you

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Chun Xi and Xiulan

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm cooking soup for the iron egg brothers

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,680
Yes

98
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
Zaotiedan brothers are lucky

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Even if this level is broken through,

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
Don't worry about hospital care

101
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
There are so many neighbors

102
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,200
We all take turns

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Hadron and Gangzi are now in the hospital

105
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,720
I came back to pack my things

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,680
I'll cover for them when it's over

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
You've been busy all night

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Hurry back to the house and rest

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
Uncle Suo

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,880
I've worked hard for you

111
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,760
Thank you

112
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,520
Mom

113
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,800
The doctor said

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
Dad, this disease

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
If you don't want to be disabled,

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
It is best to use bezoar pills

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,960
Heda Huoluo Dan

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I know it's a life-saving medicine

119
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,040
It is especially useful for patients with cerebral thrombosis

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
But this medicine is very expensive

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,720
The unit can't report the sales

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,920
You know your father's pension

123
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I also rely on the street subsidy for my living expenses

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,400
Your father is a man

125
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
There are so many apprentices

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,160
Whoever is in trouble will reach out to help without answering

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,280
Right now, you're getting up at night again

128
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
You have to buy study materials

129
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Our family hasn't saved any money for so many years

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,120
You have to buy it, too

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
It's really impossible

132
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,200
Let's borrow some from our neighbors

133
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,520
Big deal

134
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,880
I went to find a job and earn money

135
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,320
None of the neighbors are rich

136
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
And

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,720
Mom's whole life

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,240
I have never borrowed money from anyone in my life

139
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,960
Jujube aunt

140
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,000
Jujube Aunt Dong Zi

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Take the money

142
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,400
Dong Zi

143
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,480
What are you doing

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
Don't you say anything

145
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,160
Take the money

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
Buy the best medicine for my uncle

147
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Take your money away

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Xiaomin

149
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,760
This money is my sweat. Eight petals

150
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Hard money earned

151
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,120
It's all clean

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,320
Lin Weidong

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
I tell you to take the money, you take it

154
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
What are you doing if it's not Xiaomin

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,880
What time is it

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,360
You still tell me these things, some things and no things

157
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,600
This is life-saving money for your father

158
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,720
I can't afford it

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't ask you to pay it back

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,720
Lin Weidong

161
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
Are you feeling sorry for me

162
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,160
I don't need

163
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Sun Xiaomin

164
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
It's all about this time

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
You're still here to save face

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,880
Live high, don't you

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,080
OK, don't you take me Lin Weidong as an outsider

168
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm telling you

169
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,840
You keep the money for me

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
Starting tomorrow

171
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
You go to the night market and I stand

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
Give me a job and pay me back

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,560
What are you talking about

174
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
I told you to work for me tomorrow

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
Pay back your dad's life-saving money

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm leaving, aunt

177
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Orchid seed

178
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Chun Xi

179
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Porridge for Brother Iron Egg

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,720
Right

181
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,120
Brother Tiedan has just been discharged from hospital

182
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,160
The doctor told me to eat more liquid food

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,040
Yeah

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,760
Brother Tiedan is sick

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
You can't eat too greasy

186
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
You have to eat nutritious food

187
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,480
Our old suo

188
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Wash back two yellow croaker

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm going to stew it for Brother Iron Egg

190
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Yellow croaker is good. Yellow croaker is nutritious

191
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,680
Yes

192
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
What are you doing

193
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,160
You have to get up

194
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,000
Sit up, right

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Sit down

196
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,680
Okay, okay, okay, okay

197
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
Don't try so hard

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
You want to exercise again, don't you

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,880
You have just been discharged from hospital

200
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,120
You have to take your time.

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
Don't worry, you know

202
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
Shirley cooked for you

203
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll send it to you later

204
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm going to the neighborhood Committee now

205
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,840
It's a little urgent

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,080
I'll go back quickly

207
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
You have something to do

208
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
You just ring this bell

209
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,880
Xiaomin is studying in the house and reading

210
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,920
She can hear

211
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
Got it, didn't you

212
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
I'm going to go back quickly

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,080
Brother Iron Egg

214
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,480
You pad two porridge first

215
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Chunxi is stewing fish for you

216
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Thank you

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,640
Aunt Lan, let me do it

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,120
Xiaomin, you can do it

219
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,920
You feed your dad

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,040
Na Xiaomin

221
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,680
Then you call me if you have something to do

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
Dad has eaten

223
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,080
Minko

224
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm suffering you

225
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
What is Dad talking nonsense about

226
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,200
No matter how hard and tired I am, I am happy

227
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
Don't talk nonsense and think about something useless

228
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
Come to dinner

229
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Good

230
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Eat

231
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Come

232
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,760
Eat more and get better quickly

233
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Hello, Sister Min

234
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,800
Hello, Sister Min

235
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,760
Here comes Sister Min

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,520
Hello, Sister Min

237
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,200
Hello, Sister Min

238
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,560
Sister Min

239
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,360
Good

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,240
Hello, Sister Min

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,600
Good

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,280
Here comes Sister Min

243
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,440
Sure

244
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,800
Xiaomin is here

245
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,480
Look at it, look at it

246
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,960
Hello, Sister Min

247
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,480
This Xiaomin is the focus wherever she goes

248
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,280
Coming

249
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,400
Everyone said hello to her

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,440
Sister Xiaomin

251
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,560
That is

252
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,560
Don't you forget

253
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,600
This Xiaomin

254
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
But the princess in the hearts of our brothers and sisters

255
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Xiaomin

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
How come you have time today

257
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,320
Come to our land

258
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,800
I spread things and pick them at will

259
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Do your job

260
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,160
Hello, Sister Min

261
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,480
Good evening good evening

262
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,280
Sister Min is good. Sister Min is good

263
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,400
Xiaomin

264
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,520
What's the matter

265
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
I officially took up my post today

266
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,920
Juanzi

267
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,880
Where can I hang this dress

268
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,240
Come on, come on, let me teach you

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
You can hang it here

270
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
Just put it with them and put the clothes down for me

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,160
Why are you leaving

272
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Lin Weidong, what do you mean

273
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
Today is Tuesday

274
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,280
It's the day when you grow up at night

275
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,040
Sun Xiaomin, I'm telling you

276
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,280
In the future, you will go to school well for me in 246

277
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Come and work for me on other days

278
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,080
Leave

279
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,320
Start and open

280
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,160
Start, start, start, start

281
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,560
Start, start, start

282
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
Sister Xiao Min Min

283
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Xiao

284
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,120
Work

285
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,560
Good

286
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,360
Xiaomin

287
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time

288
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
What can I do for you

289
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,080
I'll meet you at Dong Zi's stall

290
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
He said you came to school

291
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,120
I came after you

292
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,360
What's the matter

293
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,040
I heard that you are going to Dongzi

294
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,440
Help him practice stalls and pay back the money

295
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,200
This boy is so angry

296
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,040
My mom, my dad and me

297
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,720
Give Dong Zi a bad scolding

298
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,080
He insisted that you promised

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
It is natural to pay back debts

300
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,200
Not Xiaomin

301
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,680
Can you ignore him

302
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Isn't that all the money

303
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll return it for you

304
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,520
You, what are you taking back

305
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,760
I

306
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,200
Leave my business alone

307
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,280
I went to class

308
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,480
Xiao Xiaomin

309
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
This Dong Zi

310
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,520
It's outrageous

311
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,240
Come on, you

312
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,680
It's not easy for people in Dong Zi

313
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,360
Can take out all the money you earn

314
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,720
Buy medicine for iron eggs

315
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,600
What does this mean

316
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,000
It means a kind child. Good child

317
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
It is this child who plays little kindness

318
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,800
I also have feelings with you and your wife

319
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,800
But it would have been a good thing

320
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,719
Why did he force Xiaomin again

321
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,560
Accompany him to practice stalls and pay back the money

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,560
Let me tell you something

323
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,120
I didn't realize it at first

324
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,919
I've been figuring out some flavors recently

325
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,600
What do you mean

326
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,280
The two children grew up together

327
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,000
Dong Zi likes Xiaomin

328
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,160
Xiaomin also means that

329
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,439
You said the two enemies

330
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,479
Good is good

331
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,959
Partial non

332
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,280
It's nothing to amuse

333
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Quarrel and make trouble

334
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,280
I don't know why

335
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,000
The two of them turned against each other

336
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,160
It's a year younger

337
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,880
No one cares about anyone here

338
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,200
It's over. I'm in front of Xiaomin

339
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,280
I want to mention Dong Zi a little

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,120
Be in a hurry at that time

341
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,000
Right, right, right

342
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,080
If I had mentioned Xiaomin in front of Dong Zi,

343
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,520
He turned against me, too

344
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,160
Right

345
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,640
You said these two enemies

346
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,360
Yeah

347
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,800
The two of them got into this

348
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,520
Then why did Dong Zi let Xiaomin again

349
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,280
Go to his booth and practice booth

350
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,600
Pay back the money when you are finished

351
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Why

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
What do you mean

353
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,760
That's all about Dong Zi

354
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,000
Want Xiaomin to come back to him

355
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
That's what I think

356
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,760
Why don't you say Xiaomin's little temper

357
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,280
That strength

358
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,400
Her whole life

359
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
She won't pull her face down either

360
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Lean to Dong Zi

361
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,160
In this way

362
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,240
That's it

363
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,400
Stall-out and stall-out

364
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
You have to be together every day

365
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,040
This comes and goes

366
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,560
Dong Zi's move is high

367
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,480
This little cleverness is here

368
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,200
So

369
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,240
You said you ran to me like this

370
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Still come to make amends, not come

371
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Are you idle? You

372
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,760
Who says I'm sorry to you

373
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
I have something serious to tell you

374
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,560
What are the instructions in the district

375
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,400
Say as you walk

376
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,240
Look at it

377
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,680
A frog mirror

378
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,920
The latest frog mirror

379
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,360

Come and have a look. Have a look

A frog mirror

384
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,080
The latest frog mirror

385
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,000
The latest frog mirror

386
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,400
It's beautiful

387
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Would you please have a look

388
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,000
The latest frog mirror

389

The latest frog mirror

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Come on

391
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't miss passing by

392
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,400
Thank you for having a look

393
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
No problem no problem

394
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll see you later

395
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,000
Thank you, thank you

396
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,600
Don't miss it

397
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
Don't miss passing by

398
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,920
Take a look and have a look

399
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,880
Twenty dollars, you see

400
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,360
It's as ugly as that mosquito

401
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,000
Stop shouting

402
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,600
Don't miss passing by

403
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,840
Towel shirts imported from Hong Kong

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,240
It's twenty yuan each

405
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,680
Come on, come on

406
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
Let's take a look

407
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,600
That's enough

408
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,000
Authentic Apple Graphite Blue Jeans

409
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,520
Straight legs, flared legs, small legs, all of them

410
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
Come and have a look, everyone

411
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,800
Complete size

412
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,440
Let's take a look

413
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,720
Walk by

414
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
Come here, come here, come here

415
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,680
You come here, come here

416
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,440
What for

417
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,640
Take a walk and have a look

418
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,920
All right, all right, stop

419
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,080
What are you doing

420
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,600
This, this, this is not your job

421
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
If they can do it, I can do it

422
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
Why can't I do it

423
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm the boss. I'm in charge

424
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
I said you can't do it, but you can't do it

425
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,240
Then what do you want me to do

426
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,480
What's the matter

427
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,360
You leave it alone

428
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
Collect money

429
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,920
Yeah, Xiaomin

430
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,240
Dong Zi is right

431
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,720
I get dizzy from collecting money every day

432
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,920
Your brain is faster than mine

433
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
You will be in charge of collecting money in the future

434
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah, Xiaomin

435
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,440
That's all the money

436
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
This Juanzi settles accounts every day until midnight

437
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,640
We're worried to death

438
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,200
Simply

439
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,360
The matter of settling accounts will be left to you in the future

440
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
Come on, come on

441
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,680
Have a look at it

442
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
The latest towel shirt

443
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,880
The latest Hong Kong stamps

444
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
The latest towel shirt

445
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,520
Don't miss it when you pass by

446
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,280
The latest model

447
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,960
Have a look at it

448
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,560
Jeans, right

449
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Would you like to have a look at the latest model

450
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
Right, right, right

451
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,920
Come and have a look

452
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,560
Is it good-looking

453
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,560
How much is this twenty-three fifteen

454
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,200
Come on, come on

455
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,120
Do you want to find it

456
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,960
Come on, this, this

457
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,960
Come on, take it. Come on

458
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,600
Xiaomin, help me reach that T-shirt

459
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Good good

460
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,280
Come on, come on, money, money

461
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,320
Do you want to find it

462
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,320
I'll come, I'll come, I'll come

463
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,800
The latest model

464
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,560
You want to see it, too

465
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,400
It's collected. It's collected

466
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,200
Thank you

467
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,080
Find a box of bags

468
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,760
Okay, okay, okay

469
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,720
Glasses

470
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,400
Come

471
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I'll come, I'll come, I'll come

472
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,080
You come out, you come out

473
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,640
I'll do it. I'll do it

474
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,160
Come and see the glasses

475
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,960
On the bag on the bag

476
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,000
The account is calculated, you little

477
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Xiaomin

478
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
It's finished so soon

479
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,400
I see

480
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
Sure

481
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,080
Your account is much clearer than mine

482
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,160
College students who go to college at night

483
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
Can you compare your straw head with others

484
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,040
Who are you squeezing right

485
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,520
No, no, no, no

486
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,200
When I say this,

487
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,080
You two are done with your work

488
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,360
It's done

489
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,960
Boss, you little money

490
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,640
First of all

491
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
I don't need to order your money

492
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
And don't you call me boss

493
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
I don't like to listen

494
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,160
Can I call you Lin Weidong after that

495
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,120
Juanzi casually

496
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Have a look, have a look, have a look

497
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,480
Who is this? This is

498
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Xiaomin

499
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Can you come to our night market to practice stalls

500
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,040
That is to add luster to our night market

501
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,440
Yes, sister Min

502
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,760
You come and practice with us

503
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,440
We big guys are so happy

504
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Isn't Sister Min exhausted

505
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,040
Do you have anything to do with our buddies and sisters in the future

506
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Say it all

507
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Let's give a hand, too

508
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,480
OK, thank you. You're welcome.

509
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,200
I also learned to be polite to us

510
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
Let me tell you something

511
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
Our Shichahai gang are small

512
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,600
It has been decided

513
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,320
Please have a night snack tonight

514
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,240
Formally celebrate Comrade Sun Xiaomin

515
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,360
Enter the ranks of profiteers

516
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,400
Good

517
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

518
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,200
Sister Min

519
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,520
This supper must be on me tonight

520
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,840
Order whatever you want to eat

521
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,560
Can be made by strength

522
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,600
Don't rob me tonight

523
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,360
It was agreed that this meal tonight would be on me

524
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,640
I invited my sister Min

525
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,480
Line line line

526
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
You two are too high without drinking

527
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,600
This meal tonight is mine

528
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,360
Do you know

529
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,920
Others want to ask Xiaomin to line up behind

530
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,720
When's your turn

531
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
Don't I have money to pay

532
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,360
What's the rush

533
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,760
Give me a little while

534
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
You are always anxious, you are

535
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,760
Shut up

536
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,920
Six sons

537
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,640
Today is my first day at the night market

538
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,800
Since you all welcome me so warmly,

539
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Then I ate this meal today

540
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
But if you please

541
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,520
You invite me together

542
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,160
Row

543
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,920
I'll eat this once

544
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,600
Row

545
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,480
Let's go, Sister Min. No problem

546
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,320
Come on, get in the car

547
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,120
Come and get in the car. Get in the car

548
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,520
Let's go

549
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,920
Still in a hurry

550
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,960
Guys, let's go

551
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,040
Let's go, let's go

552
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
What are you doing

553
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
Chase

554
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,760
Don't go

555
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,200
Run in front of me. Come on

556
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,920
Give it a push

557
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,360
Get on the bus, get on the bus

558
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Let's go

559
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's go

560
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I'll walk there

561
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,920
Let's go. Let's go

562
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
How's the food? Is it okay

563
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,320
Sister Lai Min

564
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,800
I'll get you a piece of donkey meat

565
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,920
Come and taste it. Taste it

566
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,000
Move chopsticks move chopsticks move chopsticks

567
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
Thank you

568
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,120
Taste

569
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Come and eat vegetables, eat vegetables, eat vegetables

570
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,160
Let me get you a piece of meat

571
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
Let me say a few words about this

572
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
Today is ours

573
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
Comrade Sun Xiaomin

574
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,360
Officially joined the ranks of profiteers

575
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,520
In order to warmly celebrate this important moment,

576
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's respect Xiaomin

577
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,800
To

578
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,680
Come on, come on

579
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Jing Xiaomin

580
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,720
Come and touch one

581
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,640
I won't say thank you.

582
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,960
Oh my God

583
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
Xiaomin, slow down

584
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,440
Slow down

585
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,600
Good

586
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,240
Good good

587
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,840
This wine is too drunk to cover the hat

588
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,000
Comrades

589
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,320
From this moment on

590
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,080
Don't call her Xiaomin in the future

591
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,240
The official said Sister Min

592
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
Let's respect Sister Min

593
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,280
Sister Jing Min

594
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,720
Sister Jing Min

595
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Cheers

596
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Oh, my God

597
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,520
Happy

598
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,920
It's a good time

599
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Boss

600
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
Serve wine

601
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,880
Eat vegetables eat vegetables eat vegetables

602
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,360
You're a good drinker

603
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,000
Dong Zi

604
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,840
This is called Sister Shangmin

605
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't you have to call Sister Min in the future

606
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
Bring it here

607
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,680
Wait a minute

608
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,000
Slow down, slow down, slow down

609
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,040
Slow down

610
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,280
Iron egg

611
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
Don't worry about it

612
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,600
This, this is not a hurry

613
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,320
There's never been a figure in our family

614
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,920
It's all Uncle Xiulan and Chunxi

615
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,760
Cook for me in turn

616
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,080
You two old brothers practice walking with me every day

617
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,360
I have caused everyone so much trouble

618
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I really can't bear it in my heart

619
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,400
What are you doing

620
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,280
What? This is

621
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,560
What are you talking about? Iron egg

622
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,000
What is our relationship

623
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,840
It was after strong winds and waves

624
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,640
Share joys and sorrows

625
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,000
Brothers who came along together

626
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,560
Yes

627
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,160
Say something bad

628
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,840
Without the help of you guys,

629
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
I can't even get married

630
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,520
Not to mention all these years

631
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
So many neighbors

632
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
As big as weddings and funerals

633
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,680
As small as daily necessities

634
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,520
You said jujube

635
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,040
How much did you worry about the big guy

636
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,200
How much did you help

637
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Yes yes

638
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,840
That's right

639
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,520
Iron egg

640
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,120
You can't blame Jujube

641
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,120
She's almost sixty

642
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,680
I also work all over the hutong every day for the big guys

643
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,720
Is it easy

644
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,280
Yes

645
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,240
Say something you don't like to hear

646
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,160
If she waits on you at home every day,

647
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,080
Neighbors don't do it

648
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,040
You're right, Uncle

649
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,680
Who told me to stand up for such a daughter-in-law

650
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,760
Iron egg

651
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,000
You are here, here, you are reading seedlings

652
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,880
It's not that you used to be behind people's asses every day

653
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
It's time to chase people

654
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,400
Yes

655
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,160
You have such a good daughter-in-law

656
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,240
You can steal the fun

657
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,480
Keep coming

658
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,360
I'll go a little longer

659
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Walk for a while

660
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait

661
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
One step is one step

662
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,400
Don't worry

663
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,600
No hurry, no hurry

664
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,720
No hurry, no hurry

665
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
Have a look at the new sandals

666
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't miss it when you pass by

667
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,200
Batwing shirt Batwing shirt

668
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
Don't miss it

669
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,000
The final promotion

670
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,000
Sandals are sold cheaply

671
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,760
Let's have a look at the latest model

672
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,600
Cool

673
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,960
Dong Zi

674
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,760
It's almost autumn

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,360
This Batmobile shirt and skirt

676
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,640
And these sandals can't walk

677
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,600
What shall I do

678
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Yeah

679
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
There was a wind last night

680
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,160
It's cold today

681
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,120
No one bought these things immediately

682
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
It seems that this batch of goods is going to be pressed

683
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,000
Fortunately, there are not many goods

684
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
No, get rid of it cheaply

685
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
This is the only way

686
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,000
Take it

687
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,400
Collect and collect

688
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,480
Xiaomin

689
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
Why go to Xiaomin

690
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
Why is Xiaomin going

691
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,520
Sister Min, why are you going

692
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,560
Sister Min, this dress is really beautiful

693
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,360
Thank you

694
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,400
Sister Min is really beautiful

695
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
Sister Min is so beautiful

696
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,160
It looks good

697
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
Sister Min is so beautiful

698
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,560
Sister Min's clothes are nice

699
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
If you like it, you can come and have a look with me

700
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,280
No

701
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,920
Can you two collect it for me

702
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,520
Collect and collect

703
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,040
Dong Zi

704
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
Sister Min is beautiful

705
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,360
Sister Min is so whispering

706
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
Does this dress look good

707
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,760
Girl

708
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,280
Where did you get this Batmobile shirt

709
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,360
And this flared skirt and sandals

710
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,400
If you like, you can go to my stand and have a look

Come on

714
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,640

715
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,680

716

Ten dollars

726
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,400
There are queues

727
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,600
Everyone has it

728
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,360
All of them, all of them

729
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,560
All of them, all of them

730

Line up

732
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Batwing shirt

733
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,640
Queuing, queuing, queuing

734
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,080
Queuing, queuing, queuing

735
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,720
Ten dollars, ten dollars, line up, line up

736
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,440
There are both

737
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,120
Come

738
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,680
Two pieces, two pieces

739
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,560
Come here

740
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,200
Gap

741
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,480
No one asked me how to wear this dress

742
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,360
How do you wear it? Xiaomin is sold out

743
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,560
You also asked

744
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,360
It's for your eyes to vent

745
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
This gap is clear at a glance

746
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,080
Fuck off

747
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
Batwing shirt Batwing shirt

748
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,960
Everyone has it

749
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
The new Batmobile shirt

750
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
It's not the same as yours

751
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Queuing, queuing, queuing

752
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,160
Everyone has a queue

753
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,920
The new Batmobile shirt

754
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,640
I want this, too

755
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,600
Don't worry, you have it all

756
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,720
Can I have one of this

757
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,560
Come on, come on

758
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,240
That

759
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
Your salary this month

760
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Don't

761
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,240
This

762
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,480
You deserve it all

763
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,640
You can keep it

764
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,319
When will you be able to pay your bill back

765
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
You tell me

766
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,799
Xiaomin

767
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,239
You won't leave the night market after paying your bills, will you

768
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,278
I came to the night market to pay my bills

769
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,400
I'll leave when it's over

770
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,679
Dong Zi this

771
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,520
Dong Zi

772
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,680
Why are you going

773
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
You don't care. Close the stall

774
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:40,999
Collect it yourself

775
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:44,960
What's the matter

776
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,880
Xiaomin, you are doing this day by day

777
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
Don't give Dong Zi a good look

778
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:50,640
Let him have a word with you

779
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,359
You just put him on the south wall

780
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,200
Don't give him a chance at all

781
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,759
What chance do you give

782
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,960
Does he deserve it

783
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
What a feud you two have

784
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:01,080
As for

785
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,200
As for

786
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,480
Chengcheng Chengcheng counts as my own business. I owe my mouth

787
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Continue to collect

788
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,160
Why come

789
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,920
Gap refueling refueling

790
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,840
Go on, cheers. Come on, let's do it again. Let's do it again

791
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,880
Is the mother-in-law cool

792
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,760
Not cold

793
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,240
Dry, live and sweat

794
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
It's quite comfortable

795
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,240
Why are you crazy?

796
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,280
Take your daughter-in-law in the middle of the night

797
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,720
Sweep our alley from the east exit to the west exit

798
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Idle

799
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,240
Jujube aunt

800
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,480
I really let you say that I am idle

801
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,280
You said

802
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,800
I've been back in town for almost a year

803
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,320
I can't find a job

804
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,680
Help Er Hadron sell that enema

805
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,000
Get him beaten up

806
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560
Even my grandfather said

807
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm just a stick

808
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,240
Then I said that

809
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,760
OK, I'll pick up junk and sell waste products

810
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,280
My mother won't do either hadron

811
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,400
Think I'm a disgrace to them

812
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,880
To tell you the truth

813
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,560
I'm afraid to leave the house during the day now

814
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,720
I'm embarrassed at home

815
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,880
For fear of being seen

816
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,360
You said I was such a big gentleman

817
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,840
No shortage of arms and legs

818
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,760
Staying at home like this every day

819
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,280
Eat from your hometown and drink from your hometown

820
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,240
What does that look like

821
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,280
The neighborhood in the street saw it

822
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,120
That's a good thing to say

823
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,760
These two days

824
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,000
I think it will be cool this day

825
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,400
The hutong is full of fallen leaves

826
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,360
I just want to

827
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,400
Sweep this alley for everyone at night

828
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,400
When I went to work the next day,

829
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,840
Look at this hutong. It's clean

830
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,320
Isn't it bright in my heart

831
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm doing something good for the neighborhood.

832
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,040
It makes sense

833
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,440
But our hutong is hygienic

834
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,120
Under the control of sanitation workers

835
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,400
You said you two were swept in the middle of the night

836
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,960
Isn't this robbing people of their jobs

837
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,400
So people are early in the morning

838
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040
Come to me to complain

839
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,520
You can't say that, can you

840
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,400
He sweeps his

841
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,720
We both sweep ours

842
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
By the way

843
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,880
I'm still helping him.

844
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
What's wrong with it

845
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,680
Social division of labor is different

846
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,040
Everyone has his own thing to do

847
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,000
You did somebody else's thing

848
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,400
What are people doing?

849
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
Then everyone has something to do, right

850
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,120
Just the couple of us don't have it

851
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,320
What about the two of us

852
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,920
Sweep the ground and sell your strength

853
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Just stay at home every day

854
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,520
Eat a leisurely meal

855
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,480
Then this is the way to do it

856
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,840
I can't live this day

857
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
What's the hurry with her? You

858
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,960
I thought I said that

859
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Jujube aunt

860
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,360
Daughter-in-law leaving

861
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,080
Not a brother

862
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,120
What are you doing, Brother Gangzi

863
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,520
Go

864
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,160
Gangzi

865
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,760
Xiao Gangzi

866
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,480
Mom, my daughter-in-law and I went back to Shaanxi

867
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,920
Stay at home here

868
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,680
Te humbled

869
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,840
Not brother, are you crazy

870
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,880
That's right. It's crazy

871
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm so cat at home every day

872
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,040
It's going crazy

873
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,520
Gangzi's mother, please, stop making trouble, okay

874
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,640
As soon as you leave,

875
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,400
Mom, I can't see you until the year of the monkey

876
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,600
Xiao Gangzi

877
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,320
I'm at this age

878
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,320
Still pointing to your old age and dying

879
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,040
If you leave,

880
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,920
You'll never see your grandfather again

881
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Grandpa

882
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Gangzi, you really can't leave

883
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,720
Mom, can you get down on your knees

884
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,920
Mom, what is this

885
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,000
Elder sister

886
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
What brings you here today

887
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,600
There's no wind, boy

888
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,160
Tell you what

889
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,560
I came to see you today about something

890
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
I want your help

891
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,560
What about this? You have to do it if you do it

892
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,600
Do it if you don't do it

893
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,840
Elder sister, your temper has not changed at all

894
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,560
Still so overbearing

895
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,720
If it weren't for you

896
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Nor me today

897
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,800
As long as you open your mouth

898
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,360
I'll do it for sure

899
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,240
Get it

900
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,880
Look at it

901
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,840
Three feet two is just right

902
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,000
To give money

903
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,880
Come and give you the money

904
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Welcome to visit next time

905
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,280
Collect money, collect money

906
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,560
Excuse me

907
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
Well, these pants are less than three feet two

908
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,680
I'll give you my money back

909
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,640
Thank you

910
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,960
Excuse me, excuse me

911
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,920
Really

912
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,040
No

913
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
These trousers can't be returned

914
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,400
Listen to Xiaomin

915
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,280
What are you doing? These pants have to be returned

916
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,240
What for

917
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,440
Do you have three feet two here

918
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,720
We don't have three-foot-two pants on the stall

919
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Then I'll take a three-foot one

920
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,360
Where can he wear it?

921
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,640
The ruler in your hand

922
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,360
You say three feet one is three feet one

923
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,480
You say three feet two is three feet two

924
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,920
It's an inch short

925
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,320
Just the size of the customer just now

926
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,800
Even if you can wear it,

927
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,120
That also strangles the stomach

928
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,480
You can't do this wicked

929
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,960
No

930
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm not doing this alone

931
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,720
This is what all these people do

932
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,680
Line line line

933
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,560
Juanzi

934
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,880
You go with Tu Liuzi

935
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,600
And our Shichahai area

936
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,680
Brothers and sisters who do business here

937
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
Tell them

938
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,560
Don't leave after the stall closes tonight

939
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,440
Fresh air and high steps are on me

940
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,000
I want to talk to them well

941
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,000
What are you doing? Go quickly

942
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,080
Six sons

943
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,920
Sister Min

944
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,360
Can you tonight

945
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,720
Invite our brothers and sisters to this meal

946
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,120
We are so happy

947
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,120
Come on, come on, thank Sister Min

948
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,200
Thank you, Sister Min

949
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,640
Thank you thank you thank you

950
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,120
You usually invite me to dinner

951
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,440
I'll treat you to a meal

952
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,600
It should also be

953
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,000
What about night snack today

954
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,000
I didn't invite it for nothing

955
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,240
I've been in the night market for a while

956
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,400
As you all know,

957
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,200
I, Sun Xiaomin, have never been an eventful person

958
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,920
What about the time I came to the night market

959
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,320
I see a lot of things in my eyes

960
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,280
If you don't say it, it's really a panic

961
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
So today, I also want to borrow it

962
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
Please eat this night snack

963
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,720
Talk to your buddies and sisters

964
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,920
Xiaomin, if you have anything to say, just say it

965
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,200
Everybody's listening
