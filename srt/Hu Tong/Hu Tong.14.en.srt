1
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
My good brother

2
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,200
You went home

3
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
You little brothers, get out of here quickly

4
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
Don't price, sister

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,920
Such a big thing

6
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
I must be by your side

7
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
This is my own business

8
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,280
Sister, you really have to be careful

9
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm all over the street now

10
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,240
They are all students from military cadre schools

11
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
I would like to sign up for the Army

12
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Recruit students from military cadre schools this time

13
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,800
In fact, it is recruiting

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

15
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
This is to go to the battlefield to kill the enemy

16
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,320
I know that

17
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
But I just want to defend my country

18
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,520
Go to the battlefield as a soldier

19
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
Good brother

20
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,360
I'm right. You have ambition

21
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,920
A good man should go to the battlefield to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I support you

23
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,480
All right

24
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,920
Brother Iron Egg, you have to take good care of my sister

25
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,640
I will. Take care

26
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,720
Sister, then I'm leaving

27
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
Sister Iron Egg Brother

28
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,959
You two have to keep your wedding candy for me

29
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
I thought we agreed to eat my sister's wedding candy

30
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,760
How come people are gone

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
People are gone

32
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,640
Jujube

33
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
Stop crying

34
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,800
I've been crying for days

35
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,520
What can I do if I cry

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,520
He is so alive and kicking a person

37
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
What a brother

38
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
I can't help it

39
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,520
I feel bad in my heart

40
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
Busy big brother

41
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Remember everything I just told you

42
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,400
Remember, remember

43
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
What happened to the jujube

44
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,720
I told you to hurry up, hurry up

45
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
Let's go. Let's go back. Let's go

46
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,440
Suo Ye

47
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,800
You will pick up Chunxi in two days

48
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
What are you doing here

49
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,680
Aunt, you have my house

50
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,600
What has it broken into

51
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,240
Say something bad

52
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
It's going to rain here

53
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
I have a bigger head in this room than outside

54
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
Look at this broken furniture again

55
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,200
What the hell

56
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
The family is surrounded by walls

57
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,400
Do you understand that your family is surrounded by walls

58
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,040
How do you think I married Chunxi to enter the door?

59
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,560
I'm worried to death

60
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,600
No, no, no, this marriage can't be married

61
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,440
Suo Ye, I'm not talking about you

62
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,480
You are a typical eight-flag dude

63
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Black sheep of the family

64
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,920
Don't bury me

65
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,160
Wrong, third brother

66
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
I remember the government gave you a subsidy

67
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,840
What about the money

68
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
That money is just enough to make it

69
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,080
That little money can either buy clothes

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
Or eat and drink in a restaurant

71
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,159
Buy some clothes for Chunxi

72
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Buy something delicious

73
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,959
What do you say you have left each month

74
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,039
What do you want me to say about you

75
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,159
Save face and suffer

76
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,760
Is the critical moment gone

77
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,080
Serve it right

78
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,000
Row jujube

79
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,200
Let's not squeeze on Suo Ye

80
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,560
Our old neighbors

81
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,280
Can't look at him like this

82
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Let's all reach out

83
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,560
I looked at the roof of Soye's house

84
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Have to fill ash and change tiles

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
The ceiling in his house

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,640
And the window paper has to be re-pasted

87
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
And the wall needs painting

88
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,800
How do you have to fall to the ground in four white

89
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
Then if you get married,

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,840
Do you still have to prepare for the bed and be happy

91
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,840
You have to have satin noodles, too

92
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,040
Right

93
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Red men, green women and mandarin ducks play in the water

94
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
The more auspicious the better

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
The bride's hijab must be prepared

96
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,240
Right

97
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,160
Let me stroke it

98
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,080
Washbasin kettle spittoon urinal

99
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,320
These articles for daily use

100
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
We all have to replace him with a new one

101
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
And the furniture next to Suo Ye's house

102
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,880
It's too broken

103
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,160
You have to buy some decent ones anyway

104
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
I said

105
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,640
This wedding banquet

106
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
We can set the table in the courtyard

107
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
But I did some calculations

108
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,880
I guess why I have to set up seven or eight tables

109
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
This, this, this

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,920
Wedding candy and cigarettes have to be prepared

111
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,840
It's not small. This expense

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
That's right

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
We have to scrape together the money for him

114
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,200
It's not easy for Chunxi to be a child

115
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,160
It's hard to get out of the misery

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,520
I met a person who loves her like Suo Ye again

117
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
A pair of bad karma mandarin ducks

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,640
I finally got married

119
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,720
This wedding

120
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,560
Our old neighbors can't be too poor

121
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Yes

122
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,720
Then I have written down everything that should be prepared

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
Let's divide the work now

124
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
You just said that the roof

125
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,000
Just let iron eggs and small peaks

126
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Let them plaster and change tiles

127
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,640
Then Dapeng can also help

128
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,800
Count him in

129
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,240
This way

130
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,080
This roof window and painted wall

131
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,080
I made a package with your uncle

132
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,000
Get it

133
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,840
Then coal core and I will help you two

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Me, I'll be responsible for putting Ye Suo's house

135
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
All those old goods have been demolished

136
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Find a cotton player to play well

137
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,960
OK, then I'll sew the new quilt

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
I'll embroider another hijab or something

139
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,520
I said wedding banquet

140
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
I'll take my guys with me

141
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll set up a stove in the courtyard temporarily

142
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm sure I'll let you

143
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,240
Eat well and eat full

144
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Reliable

145
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,800
Then this is almost the same

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,560
We can change this furniture wherever we go

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,720
Let Tiedan Xiaofeng and Dapeng

148
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
Go to the street and collect it

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
If you can't buy a new one, go and buy an old one

150
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,240
Tidy up

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,880
Ye Biso's family

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,960
Those messy things are strong, aren't they

153
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,080
There's another one

154
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,560
Let's see how much money we can bring out

155
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,480
Let's just gather together

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Get busy tomorrow

157
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,040
Can you move it

158
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,400
All right

159
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll do it

160
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,080
Come

161
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,120
Slow down

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,800
Be careful

163
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
How nice

164
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,400
I haven't done this since I was a child

165
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,840
Clumsy

166
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,800
Sister, your hands are so clever

167
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,560
The bride is going to get married

168
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
Then you have to embroider a beautiful hijab

169
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,200
Jujube orchid seed

170
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,520
You two take this money

171
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,640
Go to the street and give it to Suo Ye and Chunxi

172
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,600
Buy the quilt cover

173
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,640
Remember, red men and green women

174
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,640
The more festive the better

175
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
Go quickly

176
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Boss

177
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,040
Where's the money? You take it

178
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,320
You carry the coals

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Go out and buy that water bottle washbasin

180
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,480
Such articles for daily use

181
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,440
It's so good

182
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,480
Coal core

183
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,000
Good

184
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
I said I said

185
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,680
That's all that's left

186
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,600
The money for furniture

187
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
I gave Dapeng and Iron Egg

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
You should weigh the banquet well

189
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,800
Just look at it. Okay, you

190
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Do it well

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Get it

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,280
Qi Huo

193
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,280
Brother Iron Egg

194
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Where do you think we're going

195
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,600
Go and change the furniture

196
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,000
You are the director of the police station in our area

197
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,640
You should know better than me

198
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,120
This is the same as the director of the police station

199
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
What does it matter

200
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,520
All the furniture in this furniture shop is new furniture

201
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,280
We can exchange our money for one or two pieces

202
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,760
If you want to change the furniture of the whole room,

203
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
That's not enough

204
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,680
Why don't we go to the pawnshop

205
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,600
Pawnshop

206
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,800
Brother, do you really don't know or fake don't know

207
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
What's the matter

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Which pawnshop have you heard of

209
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,120
Collecting worn furniture

210
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,480
People's pawnshops collect jewelry and jade articles

211
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,520
Wenwan calligraphy and painting

212
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
Even if the old furniture is collected,

213
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,280
That's also from pear, rosewood and mahogany

214
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,560
The mahogany furniture

215
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
It's much more expensive than the furniture in this furniture shop

216
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,720
I don't think you can think of this idea

217
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,800
Neither this nor that

218
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
So what do we do

219
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,800
We can't go to the waste collection place

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
Let's feel it

221
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't you say it's really a trick

222
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,480
Now we ordinary people in Beijing

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,000
Living conditions are getting better and better

224
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,760
Say nothing else

225
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
Just the piece I'm in charge of

226
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,320
Many people are changing furniture

227
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
Brush the house

228
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,160
Who do you think the old furniture is sold to

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,400
Not all by that

230
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,720
Have the waste collectors been collected

231
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,040
Is it true or not

232
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,040
Really

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,120
Then what are you waiting for

234
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,880
Let's go quickly

235
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,320
Go

236
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,720
Go

237
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,960
Director Dapeng, you are a coincidence today

238
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,960
What does it mean

239
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,160
I just collected a class of old furniture

240
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,800
Double bed nightstand

241
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,440
Wardrobe lying cabinet chest of drawers

242
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,600
There are four chairs outside the table

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Eight pieces are complete

244
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,720
Although it's not a pear, red sandalwood

245
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,360
Such precious mahogany

246
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,800
But uh it's hard miscellaneous wood of one water

247
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,280
That's great

248
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,200
Where is it

249
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
What about the back warehouse

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Go and take us to

251
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,320
Go

252
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,560
Boss, your set of furniture

253
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,000
The appearance is really good

254
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,920
That is

255
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,520
No knock, no touch, no shortage

256
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,880
Serious good things

257
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,240
Not bad, huh

258
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,960
That's not bad

259
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,960
I said shopkeeper's

260
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,520
This is such good furniture

261
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
How did it fall into your junk hand

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,280
That's my luck

263
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,880
On that day, there was a family at the east end of the street

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,720
To sell the small courtyard where they live

265
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Go to Shanghai. Go to my son

266
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,480
I know the letter

267
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,200
I'll talk to them, male and female

268
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
I want to choose. What's there?

269
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
As a result, I went there to listen

270
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,240
I have a liking for this set of furniture

271
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,080
That male and female are eager to shoot

272
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I didn't bargain much either

273
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,480
What about this set of furniture? It's cheaper for me

274
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
This furniture is really nice

275
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,160
Business boss

276
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
How much do we want

277
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,720
You want to buy it

278
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,680
Let me tell you something

279
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,760
If others want to accept this,

280
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,080
I really can't bear it

281
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
You are my father and mother

282
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,960
If you want to accept it, can I not give it

283
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,960
The price is easy to say

284
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,120
You look at it and give it

285
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,920
Don't charge

286
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
If you want to say so,

287
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,520
I dare not ask for this furniture

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm just joking with you

289
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,120
I collected it for sale

290
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
What about this price? So

291
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
How much do I sell to others

292
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
How much is it for you, too

293
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
All right, can you make an offer

294
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,120
We'll gather together when the money is not enough

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Then I'll get involved and inquire

296
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
Is this furniture for your own use

297
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Not for my own use

298
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,720
It's for a friend

299
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,480
You also know this man

300
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,840
Suo Qian Suo Big Brother

301
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Isn't he getting married

302
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,240
We are thinking of buying him a new furniture

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Suo Ye is getting married

304
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Good thing

305
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,160
Let me tell you this

306
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't mention anything

307
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
It's as much money as you bring with you

308
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,080
If it is not enough, it should only be regarded as

309
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,119
I've joined Sawyer's men

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,679
Boss

311
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,719
It seems that you have a good relationship with Suo Ye

312
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,958
That's right

313
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,239
Let me tell you this

314
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,719
My father's generation

315
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,680
There is no shortage of good things in Suo Ye's family

316
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,360
The Qing Dynasty died

317
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,160
What about Suo Ye? His family will be defeated

318
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,080
But what

319
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,239
A skinny camel is bigger than a horse

320
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,120
After all, he is a descendant of an official

321
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,199
What about at home

322
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,040
There are also many antique calligraphy and painting

323
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,960
Although my father is a junk collector

324
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,160
But with money

325
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
He also collects some antique calligraphy and painting

326
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,840
What about this one and two

327
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
With Suo Ye's father

328
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,400
I became friends with Suo Ye

329
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,240
Suo Ye's family sometimes needs money urgently

330
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,240
So what's the matter

331
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Just leak us some good things

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,440
My dad and Soye's dad

333
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,000
Soye and I are both fathers

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Friendship between the children and the generation

335
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
That's a family friend

336
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,920
What about Suo Ye and Chun Xi

337
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,160
Our neighbors all know it

338
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Since you bought the furniture for Suo Ye,

339

The Communist Party worked hard for the nation

427
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,520
The Communist Party is bent on saving China

428

434
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,280

I wronged you

441
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,040
Where do you start

442
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,680
Dapeng's wedding is a wedding banquet held in a big restaurant

443
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
That's because Shirley's father

444
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,360
It's the chef in that restaurant

445
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,520
Their wedding banquet

446
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
It was run by the shopkeeper of the restaurant

447
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,960
Yes

448
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
But what about Dapeng

449
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,680
I also applied with the organization

450
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
According to his condition

451
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,880
He is married to ordinary people who can hold a big wedding banquet

452
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,520
But I always feel that our wedding

453
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,360
It's too shabby to do it

454
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
I feel bad about it in my heart

455
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,880
Comrade Lao Lin

456
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,040
How could you think that

457
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,080

459

Hard work and plain living are the fine style of our party

460
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
I don't feel bad

461
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
I think the big guys get together

462
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,280
Drink tea, eat sugar and sing

463
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,520
It's quite lively

464
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
The most important thing is

465

466

Jujube, now the government is organizing

510
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,400
Neighbors elect the director of the neighborhood Committee

511
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,760
And members' voting activities

512
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,680
You are the candidate for the first neighborhood committee director

513
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Do you know this in your heart

514
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,520
Aunt, I still play drums in my heart

515
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,720
I have asked people to inquire about you everywhere

516
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
Our part

517
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,160
There are many people who want to be the director of this neighborhood Committee

518
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,080
Isn't it

519
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,640
Right

520
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,280
Elder sister

521
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
I've heard of several people who have read books

522
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,160
And people with culture

523
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,000
Jujube can't be taken lightly at this time

524
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,520
Neighbors value me and recommend me

525
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,560
I am a member of the neighborhood Committee now

526
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,200
Let me say something from the bottom of my heart

527
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,280
What kind of official are you

528
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,840
In fact, I don't care if the Lord is not the director

529
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,240
As long as it can give the neighbors

530
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
There are also ordinary people doing something practical

531

I will be satisfied

532

I'm in a panic

546
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,080
What are you panicking about

547
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,720
You've been doing this since liberation

548

There is no better director than you

I'm sweating

605
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:23,920
Yes, jujube

606
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,479
You read it fluently

607
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,399
Isn't this a good read? This is right

608
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,240
You lie to us at ordinary times

609

Squeeze me, you

611
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,839

612
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,439

It is a big neighborhood Committee with 600 households

632
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,560
You can start your work so quickly

633
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,920
It shows that your executive ability is very strong

634
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,360
Sister, don't praise me

635
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,640
You asked me to do it before

636
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,120
When street activists

637
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
At that time, I still felt relaxed at work

638
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,840
Now you want me to be the director of the neighborhood Committee

639
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
You don't even know how heavy my burden is

640
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm under pressure

641
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,080
It shows that you have a sense of responsibility

642
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,800
Jujube, you have grown up

643
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
I have been with you for several years

644
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,040
Not only did I learn culture

645
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,520
I also learned a lot of things

646
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,960
But the more I learn, the more I feel

647
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
There is still a long way to go

648
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,640
Only when you know your own shortcomings can you make progress

649
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
Study while working

650
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
Learn experience from work

651
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,520
Enrich one's knowledge

652
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,920
This is everyone who works for the party

653
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
The process that is bound to go through

654
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,240
Don't be too stressed, either

655
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,160
Just remember that we Chinese Communist Party members

656
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
A sentence in the oath of joining the party

657
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,960
Serve the people wholeheartedly

658
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,040
You will always be on the right path

659
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
Elder sister, this sentence of yours

660
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,840
My Tian Zao will always be remembered in my heart

661
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,440
By the way, sister

662
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,600
Has my application for joining the Party been approved by the organization

663
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,680
Soon

664
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,360
Xiulan

665
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,440
Elder sister

666
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,080
Why did you come back so late

667
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,600
Neighborhood committees have a lot of work

668
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,320
Just finished reporting to Sister Hong Ying

669
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
No, why aren't you still asleep

670
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Not only did I not sleep

671
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,800
The neighbors are still awake

672
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,040
They are waiting for you at my house

673
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,000
Is something wrong

674
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,040
You come with me

675
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,480
What are you doing in a hurry

676
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,600
Coming

677
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,480
They're all here

678
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,200
It's for me

679
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,720
What's the matter? This is

680
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
Give me a criticism meeting

681
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,720
Sit so straight and straight

682
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
You're really right

683
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,160
Big guys get together

684
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
Is to give you a meeting

685
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,600
Educate you well

686
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,520
Not the third brother

687
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,320
Then tell me what I was wrong

688
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,640
You made a big mistake

689
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,240
Sit here honestly

690
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,520
Go ahead

691
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,600
Jujube

692
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,680
You treat comrades as warm as spring

693
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,080
You treat your work as hot as summer

694
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,960
You treat individualism

695
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,520
Self-purification like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves

696
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,040
Treat the enemy

697
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,960
It was as cruel and ruthless as winter

698
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,280
Your heart is all around the neighborhood

699
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
On the people

700
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Everyone takes you as a caring person

701
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,080
There's no one who doesn't praise you

702
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,040
Didn't you criticize me

703
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,160
Say the neat words that praise me

704
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,080
Be serious and listen

705
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
I just kicked off

706
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,040
But ah

707
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,840
You are too bad for yourself

708
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,160
Right

709
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,400
It's not just bad for yourself

710
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,680
It's even worse for the people who love her the most

711
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,760
Waiting for me here

712
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,640
Did Iron Egg tell you something again

713
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,320
I told you not to listen to him

714
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,520
I've been busy lately

715
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,480
Jujube doesn't blame other people's iron eggs

716
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,400
People really like you and love you

717
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,920
I've been waiting for you for so many years

718
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,600
Your marriage has dragged on and on

719
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,960
This has changed anyone's heart. Isn't it uncomfortable

720
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,760
Elder sister

721
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,080
You can quickly marry my brother Iron Egg

722
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,000
Save my iron egg brother from frowning all day

723
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,080
Jujube can tell you the truth

724
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,720
For your marriage to Iron Egg

725
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,640
All of us have broken our hearts

726
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,480
This doesn't like bed and quilt

727
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,280
We have quietly prepared everything for you

728
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,480
Really

729
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,640
Come here, sister

730
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,800
Sister Lai

731
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,080
You see

732
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Your uncle and aunt

733
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
Third brother and third sister-in-law

734
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,600
Fourth Brother

735
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,320
Sister Xiulan

736
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,200
You said you were all so kind to me

737
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,280
I don't even know what to say

738
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440
Don't say anything

739
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,960
You just tell us

740
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
When will you and Iron Egg get married

741
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,040
Say a date

742
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,760
Let us all be down-to-earth in our hearts

743
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,960
Soon

744
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,120
I made a deal with Iron Egg

745
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,840
When I join the Communist Party of China,

746
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,440
That's the day we got married

747
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,000
When will the Communist Party accept you

748
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah

749
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,760
Soon

750
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,240
It's over

751
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,960
I swear

752
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,440
I swear

753
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,520
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China

754
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,880
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China

755
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,360
Recognize the Party Program and Constitution

756
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,880

757
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,560

758
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,680
Observe Party discipline

759
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,680
