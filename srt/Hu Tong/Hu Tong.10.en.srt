1
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Aunt Xiulan

2
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Director Dapeng

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,480
What are your latest instructions for coming here today

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
Aunt, what instructions can I have

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,040
I just came to talk to Shirley about something

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Then go quickly

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,280
Aunt, I'll go first

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,800
Go, go, go

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,320
Aunt

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Do me a favor. Where are you

11
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you asking me to put up a slogan for you

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm telling you, Lord Sol

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Our white flour is steamed with steamed bread

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm not willing to cook paste for you.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,400
Aunt

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't worry too much

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
Why paste it

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Seam

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,520
Sew it all over me

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,400
What

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
Sew on me

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
Didn't I tell you before

23
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,880
Don't you come to our house to find me

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,400
We've been together for almost half a year

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
Haven't told your parents yet

26
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,600
I was going to say it

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
My mom asked me, too

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,880
But I'm not embarrassed to say

29
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
You

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Is too shy

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,840
We're good

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Bright and aboveboard

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,280
What are you embarrassed about

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
So what I wanted to say before

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,200
But you said we set up a police station here

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,320
Then you became the director of the police station

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,920
You said you were an official again

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
I am a housewife with no reason

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
I don't think I deserve you

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,920
Xiulan

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,320
But you said you liked me

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Want to be with me

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,560
I don't take you so bald and backtrack

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
But when I promised you,

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
Aren't you an official yet

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,480
What kind of officer am I

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,280
I am the deputy director of a police station

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,640
Besides

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Our Communist Party

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,920
No matter how big the official is, he also serves the people

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Never be superior to others

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,640
I don't care

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
I like you

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,520
I won't marry you in my life

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Row

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,600
You see you

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Look, you're in a hurry

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,280
Then you said

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
What did you call me for today

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,480
I want to discuss something with you today

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,240
I would like to sign up for the Army

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
Go to the front line of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,760
What

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,000
Go to the front

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
You're dead. You're dead

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,960
What do you mean

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,320
I was originally a soldier

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Go to the front

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,360
Kill imperialism

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,720
Defend the country

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,120
Defend the country

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
I should be divided

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
No, no, no, no

74
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,600
I can't let you go

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,440
So many people

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't lack your gun.

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Well, what if you die on the battlefield

78
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
What shall I do then

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,840
Don't worry

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
I'll just discuss it with you

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
There is no discussion

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,280
Not Dapeng

83
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
That's what I'm telling you

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,120
Then if you want to go to the battlefield then

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
I can't stop it

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,199
Then if you really sacrifice,

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,280
Then I won't live either

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,920
Xiulan

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,800
War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,640
Defend one's country

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Defend one's country

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,800
Be brave and high-spirited

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Crossing the Yalu River

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,240
Protect peace and defend the motherland

96
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,360
Is to protect your hometown

97
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Good sons and daughters of China

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Unite as one

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,800
Resisting US Aggression and Aid Korea Defeats Ambition Wolf of

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,160
Down with American imperialism

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Down with American imperialism

102
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Long live the Communist Party

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
Long live the Communist Party

104
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,080
This comrade

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Come with me for a moment

106
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
What comes and comes

107
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,680
I said

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
I don't have any silver on me

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,960
What are you wandering about

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,200
This poster still has this word

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
You did it all

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
That's right

113
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
This can't be mixed with fake

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
This comrade

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I am the director of the district propaganda group to resist US aggression and aid Korea

116
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
My last name is Wang

117
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
Director Wang

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,280
What do you say you have orders

119
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,720
It's like this

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Me

121
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,880
Look, your painting is quite good

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
And the word is beautifully written

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,240
Our propaganda group is short of people

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
Help us draw posters and write propaganda slogans

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Are you interested

126
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Interested

127
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm so interested

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Where did you say to paint

129
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll go with you now

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Don't worry yet

131
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
This comrade

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
Your enthusiasm for publicity

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,840
That is worth encouraging

134
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,120
But

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
You put this picture and this word

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
It's all sewn on the clothes

137
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
This ostentatious

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
That's not good, is it

139
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,320
What's wrong with this? This

140
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,240
What's the matter

141
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,480
You're not looking at the people on this street

142
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,480
I treated you like a joke

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Is it

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Is it

145
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,440
You listen to me

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,360
You

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,560
Hurry home and change your clothes

148
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Afternoon

149
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Come to me at the Propaganda Group to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,400
All right

151
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,120
Get it

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,280
Then go quickly

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Good

154
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,520
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

155
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,720
A latent spy who has been silent for a while

156
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Sediment rising

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
In the whole city

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,440
There have been many poisoning explosions

159
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,280
Such as malignant cases

160
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,280
A warehouse for storing materials for condolences to volunteers

161
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Multiple fires

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
And key government workers were assassinated

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
It seems that the situation is very serious at present

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,480
Comrades

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
The Korean War has entered a critical stage

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
The Taiwan authorities clamored to counterattack the mainland

167
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Some bandits and secret agents are rampant in China

168
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,320
Our superiors ordered us to resolutely suppress it

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,200
Comrade Sun Tie

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes

171
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,240
You are a famous wrestler in Beijing

172
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
Before liberation

173
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
And the three religions and nine streams in Beijing and various Jianghu gangs

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Have more contact

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
What about the decision made by the superior

176
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,160
Prepare to set up a special working group

177
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
Use your social background

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Secretly investigate various Jianghu gangs

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Latent spies in Wulin gangs and various doors

180
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,960
And counter-revolutionaries

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
Eliminate them resolutely

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,760
Yes

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,200
Dapeng, Dapeng

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't you know what's going on right now

185
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,240
At this time, you have to get cold feet and escape

186
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Director

187
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,000
I want to be a soldier and go to the battlefield to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds

188
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
How can it be a cold escape

189
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
You are a police soldier now

190
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,120
Your mission is to catch spies

191
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,960
Keep the people safe

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
This is no less important than

193
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,080
How many American devils did you kill on the Korean battlefield

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Now the city bureau has just finished its meeting

195
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
The spy activities in Beijing are becoming more and more rampant

196
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
At such an important moment

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,560
You're leaving your post

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,560
You're not getting cold feet

199
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,000
What is it

200
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,600
Director

201
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,440
I really didn't think so much

202
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,919
The order that the city bureau just gave now

203
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,360
In order to cooperate with the Korean battlefield,

204
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Beijing will hold a crackdown on counter-revolutionaries

205
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,320
Eliminate secret agents

206
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,000
Large-scale actions such as eradicating reactionary secret societies

207
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
It is the time to employ people

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
You cheer me up

209
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,880
In the future, this matter of joining the army

210
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,280
Don't mention it again

211
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,680
Yes

212
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Da Yong

213
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
You're on the battlefield

214
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Be sure to protect yourself

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,000
I know you're smart

216
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
You must remember that

217
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Sister, you can rest assured

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
Waiting for me to come back triumphantly

219
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Set

220
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Set, set, set

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Brother Iron Egg

222
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
You have to take good care of my sister

223
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,160
I will

224
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,280
Take care

225
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,320
Sister, then I'm leaving

226
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
Sister Iron Egg Brother

227
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,520
You two have to keep your wedding candy for me

228
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,000
Go, sister

229
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Stand at attention

230
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,360
Turn backwards

231
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,200
Running walk

232
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
See you later

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Goodbye, Brother Dayong

234
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,200
See you later

235
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,080
See you later

236
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,240
See you later

237
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
Goodbye, Brother Dayong

238
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Goodbye goodbye goodbye

239
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,360
Goodbye goodbye goodbye

240
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
See you later

241
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,600
Take care

242
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
See you later

243
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,320
Bring up your strength

244
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,880
Straighten one's waist

245
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Legs on side-by-side

246
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,000
Master, I've turned over a hundred

247
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
My brain is dizzy

248
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
Just give me a break

249
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,400
Rest

250
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,560
You know, rest

251
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,880
Look at you. It's turning over. It's crashing

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,640
Keep practicing

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,640
Master

254
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,240
I didn't let you go to the front line to show condolences

255
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,960
Don't be angry with me

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,640
What are you talking about

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
They don't open their eyes

258
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
You also don't open your eyes

259
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,280
Master, don't be angry

260
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,840
People sent to show condolences

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
They are all born in martial arts

262
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,160
You sing Tsing Yi

263
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,760
It's not strong to go to the battlefield.

264
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
You know that, don't you

265
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,520
Keep practicing

266
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,600
Good

267
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
Good good

268
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Good

269
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Good

270
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Good

271
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,160
The second floor of bells and drums was repaired outside the back door

272
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,400
Sunset Kunlun bells and drums rang

273
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,680
Good

274
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Long live seal him

275
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,360
For the Hou who set Beijing

276
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,640
Good

277
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,720
On the fifth day of May, the white snake Xu Xian didn't reach his head on Duanyang Day

278
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
The legend of the seventh day of July is called Tianhe Pei

279
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
Cowherd and Weaver Girl in Tears

280
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,560
Cloud cover the moon on August fifteenth

281
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
Chang'e in the Moon Palace made a sorrow

282
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240
To say sorrow, say sorrow

283
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Good

284
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,400
High rise and high fall

285
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,840
That's not bad.

286
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Good energy, good energy

287
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,680
Good

288
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,160
It's okay. Don't worry. Don't worry

289
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
Come with him again

290
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,200
III

291
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,320
Take a walk and fall

292
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,240
Come with me

293
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,840
Come on

294
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,800
Who is afraid of who

295
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,600
Go

296
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,880
Bring him a wallet

297
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,360
Good

298
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Come

299
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,840
Get it

300
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
Are we sharp (really falling) or fishy (performing)

301
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
Do we have to talk about this

302
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm here to give you a hand

303
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm not here to kick the field

304
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Fishy

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,840
It's enough

306
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,760
Good

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Come again

308
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,280
Good

309
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,880
Iron egg

310
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,320
You are now the red man of the city bureau

311
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
How do you have time to go to the wrestling ground today to help

312
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
I miss you, bro

313
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,400
Miss me

314
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,640
You don't don't don't you don't make trouble

315
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
Let's get down to business

316
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,920
What is it

317
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,840
Brother, I really have a thing

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I want to ask you a favor

319
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,120
This relationship between us

320
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Do you need to say please

321
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,400
Throw a pocket from a small piece

322
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,280
Throw a toss

323
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
Although it wasn't taught by a master

324
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
But we are also pure and small

325
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,320
Get

326
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Then I'm not welcome.

327
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,360
It's such a thing

328
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,680
You set up a stall on the overpass all the year round

329
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
Three religions, nine streams and five lines of work on this overpass

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,640
You know the people who set up stalls and busks best

331
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,200
You check it out for me

332
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,760
In these venues recently,

333
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,560
Are there any new faces

334
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,560
And

335
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Are there any people who have disappeared for no reason

336
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,040
You need to find someone else for this

337
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,040
There is no chance yet

338
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
Looking for me is the right one

339
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Accessible overpass

340
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
This play has changed and these venues have been practiced

341
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,440
Nothing I'm not familiar with

342
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,720
Anyway, there are more people and less people

343
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,960
Can't escape my eyes

344
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
So I said

345
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
This matter can only be found with you

346
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
We'll be here in three days

347
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,640
I'll reply to your letter

348
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,200
Get

349
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,880
Or are you happy

350
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,280
It's not this. It's over

351
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,200
It's over

352
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,320
No

353
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,200
How can you thank me if it's done

354
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,480
No, did you say that

355
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
We make small iron porcelain

356
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,200
Do you need to thank me

357
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,920
No, no, no, these two things

358
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,120
Friends are friends. Friendship is friendship

359
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,360
What do you want

360
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,400
After things are done,

361
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,680
Your old man's pole is old

362
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,040
Tell me about Gao Ao

363
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I said, why did you promise me so quickly?

364
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Come on, wait for me here.

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
Thinking about my old job

366
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,960
It's not a day or two, is it

367
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah

368
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,280
It's not a day or two

369
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,120
It's on me

370
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,840
Let's eat

371
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,999
That's the deal

372
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Come on, do one

373
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,719
I said jujube

374
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,400
How come I haven't seen you fat lately

375
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,239
Didn't you promise me everything

376
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,679
Take money and eat something delicious

377
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,880
I have all the money saved

378
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
After that, we have more places to use money

379
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,759
I would have guessed

380
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,320
You are stingy and unwilling to spend money

381
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,479
Go

382
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Today, I will take you to improve the food

383
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,560
How is it

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Are you really free

385
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,880
What time is it that we still have time to eat out

386
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,000
You're really right

387
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,160
This period of time

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
My job is to eat out

389
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
You're not on a mission again, are you

390
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,320
Or

391
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,720
I'll report back to you

392
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
Anyway, this task is for you

393
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,480
There's nothing to keep secret

394
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,680
Don't stop

395
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Comrade Sun Tie

396
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,840
You are losing the principle of organization

397
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,160
Violation of organizational discipline

398
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,880
I'm telling you

399
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,240
No matter what relationship we have

400
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,640
Don't say anything you shouldn't say

401
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,520
OK, jujube

402
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
Have begun to talk about discipline

403
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
You're squeezing me again

404
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,080
No way

405
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,680
Jujube

406
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,320
Look at it this way

407
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,040
You're really not mad at me anymore

408
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,520
I was really angry at that time

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,600
And I'm sad

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
But then I learned culture

411
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Sister Hongying also told me a lot

412
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,960
Things about the party

413
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,920
I just realized

414
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,120
You got that right

415
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,240
I did something wrong

416
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,320
Row

417
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,800
Jujube will rush at you this sentence

418
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,760
I must have a good drink of him today

419
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,880
I have to get drunk before I stop

420
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
What do you think about drinking

421
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,040
Don't drink

422
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,440
What kind of wine do you drink on duty

423
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,280
This will delay the great event

424
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,800
Is a leader

425
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,680
Beware of exposure

426
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,120
Have some dates first

427
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,840
Why hasn't your date come yet

428
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,480
Isn't this coming

429
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,600
Kong San, your appointment

430
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,000
I asked him to ask for me

431
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,760
Then should I avoid it

432
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,680
You don't have to

433
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
It's not like you don't know him

434
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,000
Besides

435
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,080
Don't you and I work

436
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,720
Little male and female are falling in love here

437
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Kong San, your dog can't spit ivory out of his mouth

438
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,000
Talk about love

439
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,840
Don't be blind

440
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
It's not how urgent it is again

441
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,680
I said iron egg

442
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,160
This jujube is in our business

443
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,320
But one of the best flowers

444
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm bored.

445
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,120
Why are you stuck in your cow dung

446
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Look for a fight, you

447
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,960
Don't worry, don't worry

448
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,760
This is a joke

449
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Get down to business

450
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,480
What I asked you to ask

451
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,320
Did you ask

452
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,720
This overpass storyteller sings opera

453
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,840
A busker with a handle

454
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
I did turn it all over

455
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,160
Dry and long

456
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
But there is no more and no less

457
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,520
But this wild stall

458
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,840
There are a few people who can't be found

459
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,360
Who are they

460
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
The list brought you

461
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,840
Take a look at it

462
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,200
Jujube

463
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,840
I can't watch

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,720
Keep it quickly

465
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,680
Thanks, brother

466
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
That's it

467
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,800
I'll take care of what you asked me to do

468
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,520
What I asked you to do

469
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,600
When will it be done

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Isn't that all

471
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,240
A trifle

472
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,200
It will be done in a minute

473
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,200
Take one

474
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,720
Leave as you say

475
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,280
Go

476
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,480
This wrestling

477
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Pay attention to deceiving and taking each other

478
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,080
Hit quickly and play slowly and late

479
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
There is a force to drop ten meetings

480
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,560
I was able to break a thousand pounds skillfully

481
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Like our hands

482
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
It's just two doors

483
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't look at these hands

484
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Learning can be great

485
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,960
No

486
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,800
I know all about this business you said

487
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
You just say this today

488
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
What do we say

489
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,680
Let's learn the cloud hand first

490
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,920
Cloud hand

491
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,640
Small sleeve

492
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,520
Big collar

493
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Right

494
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,480
Look at that

495
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,800
Such a cloud hand

496
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,840
Go

497
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,280
The brain cut is cut

498
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,160
See, right

499
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,040
This is called leveraging strength

500
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
Is there any more

501
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Or this cloud hand

502
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,160
Look at that

503
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,000
Small sleeve partial door small sleeve

504
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,000
Such a cloud hand

505
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,640
Go

506
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,000
This is a drape

507
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,400
I know about this

508
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
This is the cloud hand. This strength is good

509
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Have some knowledge

510
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's do this

511
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll try, too

512
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,560
Come

513
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,040
Let's draw and draw

514
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,440
Come on

515
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,960
See

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
This is called a beam foot

517
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Wait for me here

518
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,360
That is

519
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,120
It's a feint

520
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
There is a fall here

521
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
Just see it

522
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
That's not bad.

523
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Clean and crisp

524
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,240
Iron egg

525
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
My dad taught you this brain cut

526
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
Let you make it like this

527
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,560
What a shame

528
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,280
How can I be ashamed if I'm not

529
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,560
Then tell me about it

530
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,040
What's wrong with me

531
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Cloud hands are OK

532
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,240
The last step was too slow

533
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,360
I didn't grab my crotch either

534
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,360
Otherwise, why didn't you cut it

535
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,360
Let him get away

536
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
I was trying to show him my tricks

537
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,520
Slow down the action

538
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,560
There's more

539
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,760
I did it on purpose. I made a false shot

540
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Just to stop him from doing this

541
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,280
Then your kick was too high

542
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,800
I almost kicked someone in the stomach

543
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,960
Just three inches away

544
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,920
Drop it here for yourself

545
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,040
No, that's his belly

546
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
What does it have to do with me

547
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,960
He's got a big belly you don't know

548
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,000
Who has a big belly

549
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,400
Couple fight

550
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,360
Don't hurt the neighborhood

551
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,440
Right

552
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
Why don't you stop playing games?

553
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,560
Come on, you two

554
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,240
I'll take a look, too

555
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,360
Kong San

556
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,120
You don't have to heckle with that place

557
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,560
No

558
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,520
It's not a long time

559
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
Can't you see Jujube wrestling

560
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Eye addiction

561
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
You have been addicted to your daughter-in-law

562
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,760
It's not my daughter-in-law who plays with essays

563
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,480
Besides, she's not me

564
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,080
You think jujube is my

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,320
How about iron egg

566
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,320
Is it your

567
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,760
I haven't thrown you for a long time

568
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,760
The skin is itchy, isn't it

569
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,360
No

570
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,560
Good energy, jujube and then throw him

571
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,280
Jujube

572
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,480
How can you really throw me

573
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Then what else

574
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,360
Jujube still dares to come

575
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,800
You

576
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

577
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend Our Country

578
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,720
Comrades

579
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,680
The Korean War has reached a new stage

580
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
After four battles

581
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
American imperialist Li Qiwei group

582
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Has launched an aerial strangulation offensive

583
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,280
To my supply lines on the Korean battlefield

584
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,120
Carried out a crazy bombing

585
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,040
The most time of the day

586
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,680
Thousands of aircraft have been invested

587
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Drop tons of bombs

588
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,480
Seriously damaged our railways and highways

589
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,960
Isotransport line

590
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,520
For us on the Korean battlefield

591
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Volunteer soldiers

592
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,160
Cause great difficulties

593
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
In the face of imperialism

594
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,640
An unprecedented advantage in weapons

595
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,120
Now we have launched all over the country

596
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,400
A patriotic movement to donate weapons

597
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,440
The Beijing Municipal Government has also initiated

598
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
Aircraft donation activities

599
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,280
We must all actively participate and cooperate

600
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Specific work arrangement

601
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,440
Wait for Comrade Hongying

602
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,200
Arrange for everyone after the meeting

603
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,280
Donate an airplane

604
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,360
It costs a lot of money

605
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,000
Xiaozao, don't be too stressed

606
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
Donate planes

607
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,160
Mainly relying on enterprises and industries to work overtime

608
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,400
Increase production and save

609
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,480
To complete this task

610
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,400
To ordinary citizens

611
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,800
There are no specific requirements

612
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,480
Or do what you can and do it voluntarily

613
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
Jujube, have you heard

614
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,240
Some activists in other districts

615
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
Organized the masses to donate a lot of money

616
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,720
Then how did they all donate

617
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,520
I don't know the details either

618
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,400
Now, the Eight Immortals cross the sea to show their magical powers

619
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,920
It depends on who has great skills

620
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,360
Jujube

621
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
What do you think the child is doing running so fast

622
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,720
Jujube

623
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,640
Uncle come

624
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,000
Grandpa, come on, come on

625
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Jujube has something to do

626
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,720
Uncle

627
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,800
Grandpa, come

628
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,840
I have something to tell you

629
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,560
Come on, come on

630
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
Why are you looking for us again

631
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
Yeah, I don't know

632
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,960
Jujube, what do you want

633
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,200
Now this front line to resist US aggression and aid Korea

634
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
This American devil's plane

635
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,080
Drop bombs down there all day

636
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Bomb our volunteers

637
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
Our volunteers suffered a big loss

638
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
What about our plane

639
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
What are you doing with them Americans

640
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,280
We don't have that many planes

641
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,880
Can't beat the American devil

642
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
Now all Chinese people

643
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,360
Are raising money to buy planes for volunteers

644
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,680
We're the only ones with more planes

645
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,120
To work with them in the sky

646
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,120
Got it

647
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,800
Jujube, what do you mean

648
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
Is for all of us to donate money

649
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,880
Buy planes for volunteers

650
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
That's what it means

651
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,640
But then again

652
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,200
This is voluntary and according to one's ability

653
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
I didn't mean to force everyone

654
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
You can rest assured

655
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,880
Volunteer soldiers

656
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,040
Bleeding desperately for our people at the front line

657
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,480
We have this consciousness

658
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,960
Let's donate

659
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,720
Donation pair

660
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Suoqian, come down, come down

661
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
What are you doing?

662
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Why are you so serious

663
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,360
And yelling

664
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,520
Even the third brother stopped screaming

665
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,520
Did I ever tell you

666
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Tell you not to talk and move nonsense

667
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,880
How dare you scribble on this wall

668
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,440
Stop

669
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,600
Jujube, you open your eyes and have a good look

670
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,520
Am I scribbling

671
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,040
What I draw here is

672
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,400
Posters to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

673
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Who asked you to draw it

674
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,320
I also forgot to report to you

675
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,360
I, Comrade Suo Qian

676
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,200
He is also a member of the government now

677
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,560
District War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Group

678
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,880
Have you heard of it

679
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,800
I've heard of it

680
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
I have now been officially absorbed as

681
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,280
A member of the group

682
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,440
Responsible for drawing posters to resist US aggression and aid Korea

683
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,880
Write various propaganda slogans to resist US aggression and aid Korea

684
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,640
Just you

685
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,400
What's the matter

686
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,320
None of you take me seriously

687
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,040
But I'm at somebody else's

688
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,280
That's a treasure

689
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Don't say anything else

690
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,160
Look at these two words of your Suo Ye

691
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
Look at this painting again

692
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,440
Look at this line

693
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,640
Look at this color again

694
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,680
Both form and spirit, lost in mind, and entered the capital

695
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,560
Even I am fascinated by myself

696
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Come on, don't blow it

697
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,000
Take a walk, take a walk

698
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,160
Jujube, what are you doing

699
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,040
What for

700
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,600
What are you doing

701
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,000
This little comrade

702
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm telling you

703
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,640
Comrade Suo Qian is really not blowing

704
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,680
He is a great talent here

705
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,600
Did you see that

706
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,120
All the slogans in these streets

707
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
And this poster

708
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
They were all painted by Comrade Suo Qian

709
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
Have a good

710
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,560
Who are you

711
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
I forgot to introduce you

712
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,600
Me

713
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,400
He is the Wang officer of the propaganda group of the district to resist US aggression and aid Korea

714
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,440
Comrade Suo Qian has been absorbed by us as

715
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,680
A member of the propaganda group

716
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,160
Working for the Party and the State

717
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,080
Suo Qian

718
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Slow down

719
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,960
Slow down, slow down

720
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
A little heavier here

721
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,840
You're not watching

722
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,440
Suo San Ge really has two down sons

723
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,600
The painter

724
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,920
I feel good

725
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,560
It's good

726
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,640
What a surprise

727
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,520
Then Suoqian, this loser

728
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,920
There is still room for use

729
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,840
What do you have to say about this

730
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,600
Say that people's governments have a good eye for people

731
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,560
Right

732
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,240
Come back

733
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,000
Say Suo Ye Suo Ye arrived

734
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,600
Comrades

735
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
They are all busy

736
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
Suo Ye heard that you are high

737
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,960
So-so, right

738
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,560
What about me? I work as a small group member in this propaganda group

739
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
It can also be regarded as the soldiers of the volunteers

740
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,760
Make a small contribution

741
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,880
That's right, Suo Ye

742
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,200
Give full play to your strengths and do something serious

743
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,000
Pretty good

744
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,040
Don't praise me

745
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,640
I also want to guard against arrogance and rashness

746
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,560
Continue to work hard

747
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Virtue

748
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,520
Coal core

749
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,760
Walk

750
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Come with me

751
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,240
What to do

752
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,840
Haven't seen your sister for a long time

753
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,240
I'll take you to your sister to play

754
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,000
No

755
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,440
Sister Chunxi is very busy every day

756
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,320
Don't bother people's work all the time

757
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,120
I saw Chunxi the other day

758
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,240
She's lost weight

759
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,720
I got paid a little in the past two days

760
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,720
Ready to buy her something delicious

761
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,200
Besides

762
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
Her sister wants to be cored

763
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,360
I'll take a small coal core to see his own sister

764
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,120
No way

765
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,280
Walk

766
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,080
Go ahead

767
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,960
Say hello to your sister for aunt, coal core

768
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,840
Good

769
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,760
Say it

770
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm as busy as three months a month

771
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,080
The government also sent me some food and daily necessities

772
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,560
Suo San Ge can get paid

773
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,120
This Communist Party can really transform people

774
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,520
It really fulfilled that sentence

775
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
The old society turned people into ghosts

776
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,480
The new society is to turn ghosts into people

777
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,560
Waste like Suo Qian can give full play to his strengths

778
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Work for the country

779
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,440
It's not easy

780
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
But seriously

781
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,280
I'm really happy for Suo Ye

782
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,800
That's enough

783
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,200
Now, I don't have to do it every three or five times

784
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,280
I've been staring at him all day

785
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,760
My object of transformation has also turned over a new leaf

786
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm missing one more trouble

787
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Sister hurts

788
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
Sister Coal Core hasn't seen you for a long time

789
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,880
Let my sister hurt you well

790
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Don't hurt him

791
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,160
Please hurt me well

792
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,360
Go aside

793
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,760
I'll go

794
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,960
If I go aside,

795
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Where do you eat the meat steamed buns that live happily this day

796
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,400
Coal core you eat

797
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,360
Brother Suo has already invited me to eat less than half a catty

798
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,960
I also spared two bowls of fried liver

799
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm almost dead

800
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Brother Suo

801
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,280
Where did you get so much money

802
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,920
I haven't had time to tell you yet

803
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I also have a business student now

804
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
Work for the government

805
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,560
I got paid today

806
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,560
Specially buy steamed buns from Tianxingju

807
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,760
To express my condolences to you

808
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:22,319
Elder sister

809
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,519
What is this to you

810
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,880
This is not our district calling on everyone

811
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,680
Buy planes for volunteers

812
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,600
I'll take our rich family

813
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:34,720
A business boss

814
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,200
All of them have been assembled

815
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,679
Going to go door to door

816
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,839
To mobilize them to buy planes for volunteers

817
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,680
Then this plane donation is a big deal

818
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,440
How much money can these business people make up alone

819
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,838
I'm worried about it, too

820
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:51,240
I've been running all day today

821
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,838
Most bosses are actually willing to donate money

822
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,960
But some people say that business is not good

823
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,279
I don't give a donation

824
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,960
Then those people are also unconscious, aren't they

825
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,799
I really can't blame them

826
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,240
I saw it today

827
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,840
It is true that these people who are unwilling to donate money

828
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,200
There are practical difficulties at home

829
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,240
Business is not good

830
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,120
And the government said

831
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,160
Donations and materials are all voluntary

832
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,360
You can't force the people

833
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,880
So say

834
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,520
I have to think of something else

835
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,880
So what are you thinking

836
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,440
Am I just starting to think about it

837
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,240
Think about it

838
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm so happy for you

839
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,360
I'm down to earth now

840
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,280
Have a serious job

841
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,440
I also have a fixed income

842
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,080
Did we get things done

843
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,760
Brother, you really want to marry me

844
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
You don't think

845
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,040
You see, here we go again

846
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
We've already talked about this topic

847
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
What do I feel for you

848
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,360
Don't you get it

849
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,560
Besides

850
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,600
It's time for you and coal core to have a home, too

851
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,400
You can't charge all day

852
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Living in that factory dormitory is not

853
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,960
Suit yourself then

854
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,680
Small coal core, come here for me

855
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Let me hurt you well

856
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,640
You two slow down

857
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,000
Slow down

858
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,760
Where does the small coal core run

859
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,680
Don't fall

860
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
Small coal core come here and let me hurt you well

861
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,120
Isn't this the leader of Jujube University

862
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,160
Don't be joking

863
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,280
What kind of leader

864
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,720
You are a famous person in our area

865
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,560
What brings you to me

866
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,800
You're not asking me to donate again, are you

867
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
Who asked you to donate

868
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,960
It's not that Zhengge's boss Zhuang

869
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,040
Do you sell all these things well

870
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,320
It sells well

871
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
Our neighborhood

872
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm the only grocery store

873
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,840
Look at my basket, basket, basket and dustpan

874
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
From the streets and neighborhoods

875
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,880
Which one can't be used

876
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,480
You made it all up by yourself

877
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,680
Me

878
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
How can I have that free time

879
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm telling you

880
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,040
Don't go far out of the city

881
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
Over there in Nankou Village

882
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,600
When farmers are slack, ah

883
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,880
Just weave some baskets, baskets and Wu's

884
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,200
Change some pocket money

885
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,520
I'll just collect it there

886
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,120
Then you take it back and sell it

887
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,040
How big it is

888
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,120
How big it is

889
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,680
It's a trade secret

890
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,880
Can't tell you

891
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,320
Jujube leader

892
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,640
Why are you asking this

893
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,440
It's okay to ask blindly

894
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,640
Let's go

895
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,480
Go away

896
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Can you do this

897
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,000
Your uncle

898
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,720
Why are you out so late today

899
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,320
Your uncle sprained his waist last night

900
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,880
I told him to take a day off at home today

901
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,480
Don't go out

902
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,520
He had to go out

903
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,920
I don't have a stall here

904
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,000
Those regular customers who love to eat my fried tripe

905
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,720
How to do it

906
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,040
You can die if you eat less

907
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,240
If you really sprain your waist,

908
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,480
They really can't eat it

909
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,920
I said, "Can you please take care of me?"

910
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I can carry this here

911
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
Uncle, please put it down first

912
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Nothing

913
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I said your uncle

914
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,560
Just listen to my aunt

915
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,320
Keep it well at home today. Don't go out of the stall

916
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I just listen to jujube

917
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,840
I this

918
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Uncle, I remember you were in the courtyard before

919
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
Woven that Vitex basket

920
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
Can you still make it up now

921
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,600
What's there to do with it? Can it be

922
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,760
Me, me and your aunt

923
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,080
That was brought up in the countryside

924
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,400
I have been weaving this basket since I was a child.

925
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
I can't forget what is in my bones

926
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,000
Then you tell me

927
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,240
How much does it cost to weave baskets and baskets

928
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,840
That doesn't need money

929
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,080
Weaving baskets and baskets is a craft job

930
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,960
Work hard

931
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,560
Just have Vitex negundo

932
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,200
Vitex negundo

933
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,400
Where can I buy Vitex negundo

934
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,040
What are you buying here

935
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm telling you

936
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,200
Just outside the city, the field is full of Jingkezi

937
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,640
Is

938
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,400
The Vitex chopped casually

939
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,360
You have as much as you want

940
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,520
What more money do you want

941
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,600
I don't want a penny

942
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,040
Yeah

943
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,640
How

944
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,240
Section chief

945
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,200
After I secretly visited various martial arts schools during this time,

946
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,680
Guild Hall Ashram

947
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,840
Find out that these people are suspected of spies

948
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,680
Wu Feng

949
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,720
According to the list handed over by Sun Tie,

950
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,680
Further verify

951
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,040
Once it is confirmed that these people

952
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,200
It is indeed a Kuomintang spy

953
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,920
Arrest at once

954
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,760
Yes

955
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,120
Comrade Sun Tie has worked hard these days

956
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,040
It's not hard. This is what I should do

957
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,640
But you can't relax yet

958
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,520
We should continue to work hard and continue unannounced visits

959
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,760
Try to find out more Kuomintang spies

960
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,760
Yes

961
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,480
Jujube

962
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,200
Where can I get so many Vitex negundo

963
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,960
Changping Mountain is full of

964
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,560
Today I take all my brothers with me

965
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Cut so much all day

966
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,760
Is it enough

967
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,400
This

968
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,080
Jujube, why do you get so many Vitex negundo

969
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,680
Starting today

970
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,560
You have to teach me how to weave baskets and baskets

971
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Weaving dustpan and basket

972
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,520
As long as this Vitex can be made up, I have to learn

973
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,720
You really make it up

974
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,640
Why do you weave so many Vitex baskets

975
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,280
I'll change money

976
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
Exchange money and donate it to volunteers to buy planes

977
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,400
So that they can fight American devils in the sky

978
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,880
Jujube

979
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,160
You this

980
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,560
That's a good move

981
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,800
How did you come up with it

982
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,440
You don't know

983
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,560
Now all over the country are donating money to volunteers

984
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,360
Buy a plane

985
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,800
So I'm trying to do something about it, too

986
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,960
As soon as I want to earn money to donate planes,

987
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,520
I have to find a way to earn money.

988
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,240
Right

989
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,520
Later, I went to the street to find it

990
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
Look at it one by one

991
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,480
I saw Boss Zhuang's mountain products shop

992
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,960
He told me that this Vitex basket sells well

993
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,720
Don't say it yet

994
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,840
This is really a trick

995
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,400
That's not true

996
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,320
This Vitex Vitex basket is a business without cost

997
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,200
That depends on being able to endure hardships and relying on craftsmanship

998
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,120
Aunt, I'm not afraid of hardship

999
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,320
Your uncle

1000
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,000
Is this basket easy to weave

1001
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,400
What's so hard about it

1002
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,840
More than half a day

1003
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,520
Your aunt and I can teach you

1004
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,760
Besides

1005
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,560
This jujube wants this trick

1006
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,360
Make baskets for money to donate planes to volunteers

1007
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
This is a good thing

1008
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
What's the matter? Me and your aunt

1009
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,400
I have to teach you

1010
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,600
Thank you, uncle, thank you, aunt

1011
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,360
But just a few of us make it up

1012
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,280
How much can it cost

1013
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,640
Don't worry about it

1014
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,560
Most of our neighbors in this area were in those days

1015
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,920
They all came to Beijing from the country village to make a living

1016
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,240
Right

1017
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,560
Anyone who is older will make this up

1018
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,640
Really

1019
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,640
That would be great

1020
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,720
Keep up

1021
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,440
Aunt Li

1022
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,480
Vitex is here for you

1023
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,600
Quick, quick, quick

1024
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,880
