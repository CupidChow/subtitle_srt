1
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Where Luo Ye hid

2
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
It is the most famous in Beiping

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Slums and grocery places

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
The most miscellaneous and chaotic place

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Is that the Communist Party goes door to door

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,320
It takes ten days and a half months

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,600
When they're done

8
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
The task will be completed

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,680
Chief Luo has long since run away

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,120
I was fine when I went out in the morning

11
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720
How did you come back and fall ill

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
I asked Jujube this morning

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
She said she went to Iron Egg's wrestling ground

14
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
This is what happened when she came back.

15
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,920
Look at her eyes

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Have you ever cried?

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,120
Don't ask

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm sure I'm at odds with iron eggs again

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,120
This iron egg has no mercy at all

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
That's outrageous. Let me tell you something

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
This guy

22
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,960
Jujube is so sick that don't come to see it

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
What is it?

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Why are you going

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,760
I didn't ask the boy with iron eggs

26
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Why should he bully our family

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't look for him, Uncle

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Jujube, you said you were like this

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
Why are you still protecting him

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Please, please

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Are you really not looking

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,520
Jujube

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Is Xiaozao at home

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
Comrade Li

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,600
They're all here

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,720
Have a look at it

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,360
Be ill

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,080
What's going on here

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,320
My sister, she is ill and has a bad heat

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,920
Burn so badly

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Have to be sent to the hospital quickly

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Jujube

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm not going to the hospital I'm not going

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,840
Jujube can't be willful

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
Burn so badly

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
If you don't go to the hospital, you will be in danger

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,200
Uncle go behind your back, ok

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Come on, come on

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,920
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,000
Go, Jujube Sister

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Jujube, I know your mood at this moment

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,840
Since you call me sister,

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
Then listen to my sister's words

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
The iron egg thing

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
Now it's just a guess

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,360
There is no evidence that he is a spy

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
So don't worry too much

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Take good care of your illness

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,320
More important than anything else

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,840
Elder sister

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
Don't comfort me

62
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,840
Iron egg, he lied to me

63
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,200
It's true that he worked as an instructor for spies

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,600
I asked his parents

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
Said he hurried out that day

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I don't know if I've done something bad

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,320
Then when he left home,

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
Did you say anything to his parents

69
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,120
His parents said he went out in a hurry that day

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Tell them to do something

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,480
Tell them not to worry

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
And told them not to tell anyone

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,120
I didn't say anything else

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Sister, you said he wouldn't really

75
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Go and do something bad

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Jujube, listen to me

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Whether Iron Egg is a spy or not is his business

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
It has nothing to do with you

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
It won't have any effect on you

80
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
From the first day I met you

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,200
I knew you were a good and brave man

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,160
A good girl with revolutionary enthusiasm

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
And you're working on a hospital homicide

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,360
It has made great contributions to the party

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm telling you this

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
I just wanted to tell you

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,880
Everyone has the right to choose his own path

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Some people will go astray

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,960
But I hope you can follow your own heart

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Go firmly on the right road

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,560
Don't think so much

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
Have a good rest and recuperate your illness

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
Fell asleep without knowing it

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,200
Elder sister

95
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
You stayed with me all night

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,160
The fever is gone. Great

97
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,440
Are you comfortable

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Leadership

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
It's great that you're here

100
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,720
The fever has gone down

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,640
I went to work, too

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,600
Take good care of her

103
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,960
Then you can eat a fried dough stick before you go

104
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't eat

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,480
Leave it for you to eat. My unit has it

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,480
Take care of yourself

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Have a good rest

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,560
I'll come to see you after work

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
Jujube sister, do you want to eat fried dough sticks

110
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,440
Your favorite food

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,400
Come

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm really hungry

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,640
Jujube sister

114
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Such a big leader stayed with you all night

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
I've heard about it before

116
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,560
This cadre of the Communist Party

117
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
It is true to the people

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
I kind of saw it with my own eyes today

119
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,720
There is porridge here

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,400
The information you provided is very important

121
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,640
Chief, I was going to find out

122
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600
The exact lurking place of Luo Wenhui

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
It depends

124
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,520
Liang Liqun doesn't know his foothold either

125
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Top killers like Luo Wenhui

126
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,760
Has always been a loner

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It is impossible for Liang to know

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
Of his hiding place

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,800
In this way

130
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Your mission in prison has been completed

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
There is no need to crouch here any longer

132
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,560
You're talking about

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
From these two agents

134
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,880
I really can't ask anything

135
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,320
You're coming with me now

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Report directly to the headquarters

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,320
Team leader

138
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't I need to get out of jail

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,520
Your undercover mission is top secret

140
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Is directly affected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Directly led by the Ministry of Social Affairs

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
Local public security system

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,480
I don't know who you really are

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
What about this prison

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,080
It's the military system again

146
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
So there is no need to go through any formalities

147
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Just come with me

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,240
Good

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,920
Go

150
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,760
Team Leader Wu

151
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Comrade Sun Tie

152
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
Our Central Ministry of Social Affairs

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,320
In order to solve the assassination of leaders,

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
A special task force was set up

155
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,560
This is the temporary headquarters

156
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
From today on

157
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,200
You are a full member of our command

158
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,240
If you want to be noble in front of people,

159
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Must suffer after others

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
Just bear it

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Brother Tong hurts, hurts

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
What boy is called Master

163
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,400
Master, give me a break

164
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,800
You didn't start until you were six years old

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,760
It's really a little late

166
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,160
If you don't work hard,

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,160
Then it will be wasted

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,960
Push hard

169
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
The last name is Tong

170
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,960
You can really kill yourself.

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,920
You torture such a small child

172
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,000
Are you still human? You

173
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,280
Start and open

174
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
What are you messing around with here

175
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Am I human

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm doing it for his own good

177
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,920
So that he can form a horn

178
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,040
Have a serious meal to eat

179
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't get mixed up like you

180
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,480
A loafer who is idle and achieves nothing

181
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Who do you call a loafer

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
It's about you

183
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
What's the matter

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,480
I can't even find a prostitute I like

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
My sister is not a prostitute

186
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm sorry, good apprentice

187
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
Master is wrong

188
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,360
Master apologizes to you

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
If you ever call my sister a whore again

190
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,440
I will never be your apprentice again

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't don't don't

192
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,720
Good apprentice

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,120
Listen to Master and practice well

194
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
When it becomes a corner and has money,

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,920
Redeem your sister from that dirty place

196
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Good boy

197
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,640
Is a good boy

198
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,120
Come and push hard

199
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
You don't have to hold me

200
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
I feel almost there

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why did the girl come back so soon

202
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,880
Why don't you keep it for two more days

203
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,360
Aunt, I'm all right

204
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,040
How can I stay in a hospital

205
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,920
Elder sister

206
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I have been an apprentice to Brother Tong now

207
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I want to practice well

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
Form an angle in the future

209
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,960
Thank you, fourth brother

210
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
I should be the one who said thank you

211
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
Can receive such a good apprentice

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,720
Chief Gao

213
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,440
According to Comrade Sun Tie's report

214
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Secret agents lurk in Beiping's famous

215
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Slum grocery store

216
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
The most miscellaneous and chaotic place should be the overpass

217
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,720
There are many people in Tianqiao area

218
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
The situation is very complicated

219
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,640
If you want to find Luo Wenhui's specific hiding place,

220
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
It is necessary to mobilize the masses

221
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Conduct large-scale household screening

222
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,320
If there is such a big noise,

223
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,720
Will surprise Luo Wenhui

224
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,360
He will probably escape from his hiding place

225
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,160
We'll look for him then

226
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,400
But it's more difficult

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,680
That's right

228
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,520
If this method doesn't work

229
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
That flyover is such a large area

230
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,600
If you want to find the specific hiding place of Luo Wenhui,

231
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,560
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,000
The celebration is only five days away, comrades

233
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,320
We have to hurry and find a way

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Luo Wenhui

235
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,720
Section chief

236
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,080
Do you think you can bring me a team

237
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,840
We disguised ourselves as kitchen knife grinders and goldfish sellers

238
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
All kinds of vendors who play cotton and walk the streets

239
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
We lurk into the flyover

240
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
Our search from street to street

241
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Maybe we can find the trace of Luo Wenhui

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,280
This method is not good

243
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,160
Doesn't this turn into a blind cat to touch a dead mouse

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
That's better than being stunned here

245
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,480
Maybe my blind cat

246
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,960
I really met a dead mouse

247
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
The train of thought is right

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
But where is Xiao Sun

249
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
We don't have the time now

250
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Xiao Sun, the section chief, reminded me

251
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,280
We searched from house to house for fear of startle

252
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,800
There is not so much time to search along the street

253
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,480
Can we change our thinking

254
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,160
Luo Wenhui, he wants to live, too

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,880
He also wants to eat and buy things

256
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,480
Then we have all the information about Luo Wenhui here

257
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Can we take this information from

258
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,920
Find out some of his living habits and characteristics

259
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,920
Then send someone to guard

260
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,280
Lao Wu, this idea is good

261
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
Come and let's take Tam Man-hui's information

262
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,680
Analyze it carefully again

263
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,840
Focus on his living habits

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,160
Start with hobbies

265
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,840
Try to find a breakthrough

266
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,000
Good

267
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Coal core, this child has a good life

268
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,840
You have jujube, Aunt Li and Uncle Gui

269
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
And Shirley raised him

270
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,080
Now the boy boss has accepted him as an apprentice again

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,560
Let him learn his skills and become a horn

272
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
I really don't know what to say

273
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,880
I said

274
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
And me

275
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
Coal core is your brother

276
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,040
After that, it will be my brother-in-law

277
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm interested in your sisters

278
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,600
That's really giving everything.

279
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,240
Brother Suo, I know you are good to me

280
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,640
And I know you want to marry me

281
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,240
But your ancestors are in the flag

282
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
Although it's not Maharaja Baylor, is it

283
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,000
But he is also the gentleman of the official family

284
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
Popular and spicy

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,080
I grew up eating, drinking and having fun with cages and birds all day

286
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,040
Even that small courtyard is your ancestral property

287
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm a whore

288
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,400
Not worthy

289
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,080
Here we go again

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
And I'm telling you

291
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,360
Don't mention the word young master to me

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm ruined by these two words

293
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,680
That's right

294
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm a cage bird

295
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,480
Teasing crickets and raising Guo Guo grew up

296
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
But besides playing, I can

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,720
What else would I do

298
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,240
That little fortune handed down from the ancestors

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,520
It's all ruined to me

300
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,880
You see, I'm down and out to be a gangster

301
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,720
I heard the boy boss tell the coal core

302
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,680
Learn your skills well

303
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,360
Grow up and be a horn

304
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,199
Earn money to redeem your sister

305
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,439
I gave myself a big slap in the mouth

306
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,400
What am I

307
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,320
I'm a fart

308
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,320
Don't say you're redeemed

309
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Even coming in to see you today

310
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,640
They were all rewarded by the boss

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,560
Mention my ancestors again

312
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,120
I've lost people when I mention my ancestors again. I

313
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,440
I also told you

314
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,800
Your brother, I can't bear it now

315
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
You can't carry a basket with your hands

316
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,000
A complete waste

317
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,840
You said you didn't deserve me

318
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
I really don't think I deserve you

319
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,000
Brother Suo, don't say that

320
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,080
At least you are the world

321
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,320
The man who really loves me most

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,640
Xi

323
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,040
We're not demanding

324
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,040
Why is it so hard to be together

325
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,040
We are really a pair of bad karma mandarin ducks

326
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
This hard time for us

327
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,480
When will it come to an end

328
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,800
Coal core

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,120
You've spent two hours. Are you tired

330
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,040
Have a rest

331
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
Tired

332
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
My master said

333
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,520
I won't practice this big muscle again

334
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,960
It won't open

335
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you have any pain

336
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,480
Pain

337
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,640
You still practice when you hurt

338
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,800
I have to practice for my sister's pain

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,200
A real man

340
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,480
Then you practice

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,120
Sister, you have been ill in hospital for so long

342
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,280
Why didn't Brother Iron Egg come to see you

343
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
He's dead

344
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,320
He he's dead

345
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,640
How did you die

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Drowned in a cesspit

347
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,720
You lie

348
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,240
Don't you ask

349
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask, okay

350
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,320
I'll fetch water for you to sleep later

351
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
According to this data,

352
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,120
Luo Wenhui is from Sichuan

353
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,480
An important characteristic of Sichuanese

354
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,560
It is inseparable from eating spicy food in life

355
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,720
This feature is obvious and prominent

356
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,960
It is not common in Beiping

357
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,960
It is not difficult to find him by following this clue

358
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,640
Look at that

359
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,000
Luo Wenhui in the photo

360
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,560
Dressed neatly

361
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
Explain what

362
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,880
It shows that he loves cleanliness very much

363
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,040
But the flyover is a grocery store

364
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,760
All the people who live are ordinary people

365
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,840
And next to Longxugou

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,600
The sanitary conditions there are extremely poor

367
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,120
Even the daily water supply

368
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,240
Have to queue up for limited supply at regular intervals

369
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Peiping is now in midsummer

370
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,440
He loves cleanliness so much

371
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
How to solve the problem of bathing

372
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,320
Yeah

373
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
I see

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,120
From now on

375
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,600
We should focus on investigating Sichuan restaurants

376
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Bathhouse

377
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,720
Team leader

378
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Restaurants in this area of Beiping

379
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Most of them are mainly Shandong Shandong cuisine

380
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,560
I don't think I've heard of it

381
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
What big Sichuan cuisine restaurant is operated

382
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,560
But near the overpass

383
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,680
Zhushikou and Hufangqiao Street

384
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,280
There are several Tsinghua pools

385
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,880
That is the place where Peiping people often take a bath

386
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,080
There is no big Sichuan restaurant

387
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,560
Is there a small restaurant opened by Sichuanese

388
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,920
Or a stall set up by Sichuanese

389
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,800
There should be

390
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,440
Not only Sichuan restaurants but also food stalls

391
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,440
Also check the vicinity of the overpass

392
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
All the vegetable stalls selling peppers

393
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
There is a good possibility

394
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
Luo Wenhui bought pepper

395
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,880
Go back and cook for yourself

396
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,920
Then this range is too large

397
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,480
Xiao Sun sent out all the men

398
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Rely on the local government to check

399
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,800
Yes

400
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
In addition to these

401
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
This Luo Wenhui is before the action

402
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,280
I will definitely step on the spot in advance

403
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,240
So we're going to be on that day

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,880
On the route of leaders' actions

405
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,800
Place people in advance to guard

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Maybe we can find Luo Wenhui's whereabouts

407
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,920
Comrades, the task has been clearly defined

408
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's split up

409
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,160
Good

410
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
The mountain bladder opened

411
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,040
Hold out your chest and put your stomach away

412
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,880
Hook toe

413
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
Push on

414
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
Don't be discouraged

415
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,960
Kick

416
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,040
Sige coal core from morning till night

417
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,480
They're all kicking in the lower back

418
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,840
I was so tired of him that I panicked

419
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
Let the children rest for a while

420
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,400
Eat all the bitterness and be a master

421
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,160
Where is this practice?

422
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
Push hard

423
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,080
Why did you stop kicking?

424
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,720
Master, I have to pee

425
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,240
No pee kicking

426
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
I can't hold it anymore

427
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,520
That won't kick either

428
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,440
Fourth brother, you have gone too far

429
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,920
Children are not allowed to pee

430
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,840
It's suffocated. Wait a minute

431
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,920
You don't understand

432
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,240
What we pay attention to in this line of work is to practice urinating in the morning

433
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,960
It's up to practice and sweat to send this thing out

434
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
That's how my master practiced me at the beginning

435
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,800
No

436
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,680
Jujube

437
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,920
This coal core is now a disciple of the boy's boss

438
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
How people want to practice is a matter for both teachers and disciples

439
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
Don't worry about it here

440
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,240
I have to be redundant, okay

441
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,680
You are really redundant

442
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,720
You don't worry about what you should worry about

443
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
What you shouldn't worry about, you worry about it

444
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Let me ask you something

445
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,520
What the hell is this iron egg doing

446
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
I haven't shown my face for so long

447
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
It's outrageous

448
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,560
That's it, jujube

449
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,120
I didn't dare ask you

450
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,640
You said you were so sick

451
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
This iron egg doesn't show a face

452
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,520
What's more important to him than you

453
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,920
Elder sister

454
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,560
What are you two doing here

455
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,720
Let's see if you're feeling better, both of us

456
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,560
I'm much better

457
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,360
How did you guys

458
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,840
I didn't collect coal and garbage today

459
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,120
No

460
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,000
These days

461
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,480
The government organized the people to clean up the garbage mountain

462
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,120
There are too many of us

463
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
I didn't join in the fun

464
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,640
I can't pick up the garbage

465
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,080
You won't go to Shun Grain, will you

466
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Then how can it be

467
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,520
In the past, ah, it was the grain of the Kuomintang

468
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
It's the Communist Party now

469
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,040
It's government food

470
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Isn't it a crime to steal from us again

471
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,240
You boys are clever

472
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,360
Brothers must be short of chewing grain during this time

473
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,880
How many children do I have for you

474
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,680
Take a bite

475
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,120
Sister sister

476
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
No need

477
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
We're both grown up

478
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,440
It's not easy to find someone who stutters

479
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah, that's not this morning

480
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
Kongsan, Tianqiao Wrestling Ground

481
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Ask us to be his trust

482
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,720
Just help heat up the venue and shout

483
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,840
And we agreed

484
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,720
There are many businesses like this

485
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Don't worry

486
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,200
Can't starve us

487
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
Grow up.

488
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,240
Know that you have planed

489
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,040
Let my sister rest assured

490
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,920
By the way, sister

491
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,040
Do you have any news from Brother Iron Egg

492
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,120
Nothing, sister

493
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
Tomorrow, I will go to the wrestling ground with Xiaofeng

494
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,040
I'll ask for you again

495
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm sure I'll find it

496
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,840
Sell peppers. Sell peppers

497
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,360
Fresh pepper

498
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,720
It's not spicy and it doesn't cost money

499
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
Peppers are sold

500
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
Peppers are sold

501
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,920
Peppers are sold

502
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,400
It's not fresh. No money

503
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,520
Boss, how do you sell this cucumber

504
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Aunt, we have two cucumbers and one big son

505
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Is it fresh

506
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,200
How fresh it is

507
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,280
Aunt, look at it

508
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,520
Top flower with thorns

509
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
Master, master

510
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Don't you think selling vegetables is an iron egg

511
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,000
Bullshit

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,120
Can iron eggs sell vegetables

513
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,920
Yes, it is an iron egg

514
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Master, look at it quickly

515
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,760
Get it

516
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Aunt, would you like some of this pepper

517
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,720
It's spicy. Eat that thing on this hot day

518
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,360
Fresh

519
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:18,840
Don't don't don't

520
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,240
That's true

521
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,040
Where is this sung?

522
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,120
Yeah

523
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,840
Sell peppers. Sell peppers

524
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,440
Fresh pepper

525
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,960
It's not spicy, it doesn't cost money. Which one does this sing?

526
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Peppers are sold

527
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Peppers are sold

528
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
Peppers are sold

529
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,520
The day after tomorrow is the right day for us to act

530
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,960
The third one told your men

531
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,280
There must be no mistakes

532
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,760
Yes

533
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,600
Team leader

534
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,640
This

535
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,040
When Liang Liqun first entered Beiping,

536
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,440
Meet us

537
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
It's been five or six days

538
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I didn't see anyone either

539
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,160
It can't be something's wrong, can it

540
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,920
It's right not to show up

541
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,520
They are under the direct leadership of Shangfeng

542
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,320
I can connect with us to convey the peak

543
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,480
The task assigned to us

544
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,160
Yes

545
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,080
The task is very clear

546
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
Our task is to create chaos

547
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Cover the safe evacuation of killer one

548
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
But

549
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,720
Brother

550
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,360
This

551
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,800
Who the hell is killer number one

552
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,040
How do I know

553
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,600
All I know is killer number one

554
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,240
Approximate area of hands-on

555
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,880
We just have to stay in that area that day

556
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
As soon as the gun goes off

557
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,400
Let's act immediately to create chaos

558
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,320
Finish our task and it's over

559
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,320
Who is the number one killer

560
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,560
We don't even know

561
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,680
How to finish the task

562
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
You're stupid

563
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
I made it so clear to you

564
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,680
We'll do it as soon as the gun goes off

565
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,040
Whoever it is

566
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,000
It's over to do our thing

567
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,000
And the identity of this character

568
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,480
The fewer people who know, the better

569
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Didn't that Liang say it

570
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,480
This killer is a sharpshooter

571
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,080
Extremely deep in martial arts

572
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,360
Shangfeng sent him on a mission

573
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,680
Never lost his hand

574
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,720
Since we can send him out this time,

575
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,800
There is also a person named Liang who is responsible for containment

576
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,120
I think the target of assassination will die

577
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,760
We just need to cover his safe escape

578
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,960
The party and the state will be rewarded

579
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,120
Brother was exposed when he started in the street

580
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,080
It's exposed. Okay

581
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,120
The more exposed the better

582
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,280
After this operation is completed,

583
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,320
Shangfeng will definitely send us to evacuate Beiping immediately

584
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,280
What's the matter

585
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,360
You still want to stay in this place

586
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,800
To tell you the truth

587
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,080
Now as long as I walk down the street,

588
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,560
I always feel like there are countless pairs of eyes staring at me

589
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
These people in Beiping

590
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
Now it has been incited by the Communist Party

591
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,320
Every other time is the household survey

592
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,280
In such a short time

593
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,560
How many times have we moved our quarters

594
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,920
This is a day when people are neither ghosts nor ghosts

595
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,160
I don't want to spend another day

596
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,720
That's right

597
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,040
The PLA has just entered the city

598
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,080
Just take this Han Qingkui in one pot

599
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,080
And that Xu Ming Lao Mu

600
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
They were all caught by the Communist Party

601
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,640
Fortunately, I am a cunning rabbit

602
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
Multiple residences have been placed in advance

603
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
Otherwise, now the two of us

604
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,600
Must be in this Communist prison

605
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,720
Going to jail

606
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,640
Brother or you are wise

607
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Brother stay up for two more days

608
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Our brothers will escape from this misery

609
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,280
Yes

610
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,440
Good

611
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,000
Good

612
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,320
Good

613
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,080
Good

614
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,240
Good

615
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:25,000
Good

616
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Good

617
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,360
Good

618
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,920
Look, this is called tooth sword

619
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Good

620
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,680
Good

621
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,880
Good

622
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,480
Two wings busy

623
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,280
Good

624
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,200
Quanfu Qitian

625
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,280
May your gold and jade fill the halls

626
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,400
When I took this kite,

627
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,120
We must copy our armpits

628
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,840
Good

629
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,080
When I beat this little wood,

630
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,720
How is it

631
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,160
I won't talk anymore

632
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,480
Come quickly

633
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Good

634
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,080
Open

635
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Take a swim in your place inside the overpass

636
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,640
Shouting big bowls of noodles here

637
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,840
Shouting over there is boiled bean juice porridge

638
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,560
The name of the five apprentices is Jumping Huluba

639
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,280
The name of the six apprentices is to jump the gourd

640
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,880
Seven apprentices named Feng Suihua

641
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,960
The name of the eight apprentices is Hua Suifeng

642
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,280
Look over there

643
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,000
Fuck off

644
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,880
Cheating

645
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,000
You cheat

646
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,640
This is not cheating

647
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,680
There are kicks in wrestling

648
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,080
How can you kick if you have a kick

649
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,560
How to kick it

650
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,120
Boot belly down. This is called kicking

651
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,360
How can you kick this

652
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,360
I just kick

653
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,240
Just kick it

654
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,200
I kicked short today

655
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,000
Kick short

656
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,240
Kick your head high. It's gone

657
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,280
You can kick, can't you

658
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
Stabbing my foot is me

659
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,680
We can do this

660
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,120
I'll put my leg here for you to kick today

661
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,440
Kick for nothing, right? Kick for nothing

662
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,320
Kick and kowtow to learn from teachers

663
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,640
What if the kick is broken and broken

664
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,040
It doesn't matter. I'm not strong

665
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,000
Get it

666
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,120
This one

667
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,800
Kick and kowtow immediately

668
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,680
Pick up your legs at the front door later

669
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll pick it up there

670
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,160
Connect

671
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,440
Good

672
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,120
It's boring

673
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,799
Bao Jin

674
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,560
Connect

675
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:31,799
Bao Jin

676
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,000
Come on, come on

677
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,960
Come and push hard

678
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:42,000
Good

679
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,720
Good

680
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,240
It's not you. Come on. Come on

681
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,799
What's the matter

682
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,040
You told me to kick

683
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,080
I did let you kick

684
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,640
What's the name of your leg lift

685
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Is this called leg lifting

686
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,480
What's this called

687
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,960
Basic skills of wrestling

688
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
Kick and draw plates and kneel

689
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,600
I call this a big plate leg

690
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,080
Don't follow this dish

691
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,319
Can you lie down without this plate

692
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:03,319
Thank you all

693
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,680
Good

694
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,120
This was for us just now

695
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
It's up to you this time

696
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Come on, come on

697
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,160
Give it all

698
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
OK, thank you

699
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
Everyone gives it

700
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,200
Give, give, give

701
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,000
Come and come

702
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,920
Everyone gives it

703
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,440
Take a look and have a look

704
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,040
Peppers are sold

705
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,720
Peppers are sold

706
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Fresh pepper

707
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,080
It's not spicy and it doesn't cost money

708
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,520
Fresh pepper

709
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
Take a look and have a look

710
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,400
Fresh pepper

711
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,120
Elder sister, do you want to see the pepper

712
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,680
Big brother, how do you sell this pepper

713
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,240
Sister, listen to your accent

714
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,880
Are you from Sichuan

715
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,640
I'm from Luzhou, Sichuan

716
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,080
Luzhou

717
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,960
Hello, Luzhou

718
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,840
Luzhou produces wine

719
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,920
The water there is good

720
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,160
We have wine workshops all over the place

721
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,080
Elder sister, what do you have in this altar

722
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
This one

723
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,880
This is the watercress chili pepper sauce from our hometown

724
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,360
What

725
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,920
Pepper sauce with watercress

726
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,920
Pepper sauce with watercress

727
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
Hot sauce with watercress

728
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,480
We also sell watercress hot sauce on this overpass

729
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,240
There are few people in this Beiping city and Sichuan

730
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,520
It's not easy to eat some hometown food

731
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,120
I've been looking for it for a long time, too

732
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,160
I found a small shop selling pickles

733
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,440
The boss's wife is also from Sichuan

734
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,320
Their home

735
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,080
Occasionally, I will make some watercress chili pepper sauce for sale

736
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
So I'm a regular customer of his

737
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,160
Then this watercress hot sauce must be delicious

738
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,920
Do you know where this shop is

739
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,440
Walk two blocks ahead

740
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,360
Turn around and have a small facade

741
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,920
The sign says Mingyuan Sauce Restaurant.

742
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,280
To weigh peppers

743
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,680
Good

744
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
Thank you, elder sister

745
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,920
Guest officer

746
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,400
What can I get you

747
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,960
I'm from the Public Security Bureau

748
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Sir

749
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
We are all law-abiding citizens

750
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Didn't do anything illegal

751
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,280
Don't be nervous, you two

752
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm here to get some information

753
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,880
I hope you can cooperate actively

754
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,520
Cooperate with certain cooperation

755
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
What can I do for you

756
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Have you seen the man in the photo

757
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,040
Haven't seen it

758
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,520
Take a closer look

759
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I really haven't seen it

760
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,840
Look at it

761
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,680
I seem to have met this man before

762
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,720
Really

763
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
When have you seen it

764
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,760
I remember him four days ago

765
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,240
I came to the store to buy watercress chili sauce

766
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,600
Wife of shop-owner, take a good look again

767
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,560
Are you sure

768
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,480
It's this man

769
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,720
That man is not as spiritual as the man in your picture

770
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,440
The man was dirty and unshaven

771
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,680
But the man's eyes looked fierce

772
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,000
It's exactly the same as the eyes in this photo

773
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,040
It should be him

774
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,600
Do you know where he lives

775
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,040
I don't know exactly where I live

776
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
But it should not be far from here

777
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,840
Sometimes I can meet him in the street

778
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,720
He should be on the south side

779
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Thank you both

780
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
This is my phone

781
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,200
If you two see him again,

782
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,440
Don't disturb him

783
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,680
Call me right away

784
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,600
All right

785
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,160
You can rest assured to walk slowly

786
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
We thought of Sichuan cuisine

787
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,160
I thought of pepper

788
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,240
I just didn't think of Douban hot sauce

789
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,760
Iron eggs really have you

790
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,720
This time, ah

791
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,320
It's really a blind cat that meets a dead mouse

792
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,200
God has eyes

793
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,720
It really made me meet the big sister in Sichuan

794
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,160
Sure

795
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,160
Now that we know that Luo Wenhui

796
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Approximate lurking position

797
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,360
So our grass-roots organizations

798
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
You will find a clue to him

799
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,120
Lao Wu immediately cooperated with the local police station

800
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,440
Get in touch with the street government

801
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,720
Check the registration of all migrants in that area

802
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,000
And household information

803
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm on my way

804
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,440
I'll go with you

805
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:57,920
Go

806
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,320
Go

807
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,480
There's someone inside

808
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,840
Do it

809
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,720
Wait

810
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,680
This master is good at kung fu

811
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,480
The three of us may not be able to catch him

812
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,680
In this way, we will go back and report to Chief Gao first

813
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,240
Yes

814
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,640
Go

815
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,720
I said Da Yong Xiao Feng

816
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
You two brothers are also very clever

817
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,440
Don't pick up rags and beg for food every day

818
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,160
Simply go to the wrestling ground to help

819
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,600
Isn't it okay to kowtow to me and be an apprentice

820
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,200
Right

821
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,960
Come on, third brother

822
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,360
I really want to learn to fall

823
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,200
Then we have to learn from Brother Iron Egg

824
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,880
He is my future brother-in-law

825
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,640
Say something bad

826
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,480
He is much better at kung fu than you

827
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,920
Xiaofeng

828
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
Don't mention your iron egg brother

829
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,320
He is now down and out selling vegetables all over the street

830
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,240
Why did he fall?

831
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,400
You learn wrestling from him

832
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,840
You're not ashamed

833
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,840
You talk nonsense

834
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,120
My brother Tiedan is a famous wrestling king in Beiping City

835
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,040
How can you run to the street to sell vegetables

836
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
You really don't believe it

837
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,640
Yesterday, I was on the street

838
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,400
See, it's called a real one

839
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,200
He is carrying the burden and selling vegetables all over the street now

840
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,600
You don't believe me. Ask my master

841
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,200
Third brother, what he said is true

842
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,360
It's absolutely true

843
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,360
I saw him at the alley yesterday

844
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,120
Because one big son and two cucumbers

845
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,400
I'm still talking with an old lady

846
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,440
I should have said hello to him

847
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,160
But wasn't I afraid he wouldn't hang up

848
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,960
I ignored him

849
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,920
No, you're sure it's Iron Egg

850
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,280
My friendship with him

851
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,520
I can recognize him when he burns to ashes

852
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,800
You can never go wrong

853
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,200
Go

854
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,840
Brother

855
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,760
Go

856
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,960
There was light just now

857
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,960
Where are the people

858
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
Hot sauce with watercress

859
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,680
It must be Luo Wenhui

860
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,080
Lao Wu asked the comrades to search carefully in the warehouse

861
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,960
Yes

862
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Comrades check carefully

863
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,320
Yes

864
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,240
Did Tiedan see Luo Wenhui

865
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,000
No
