1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,920
Then you have to eat breakfast on the table quickly

2
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Make up for sleep after eating

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Where's my dad

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
I went to the root of the city wall early in the morning

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
I went to teach those apprentices to play wrestling

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,800
Xiaomin

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,040
Have you seen our Juanzi

8
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,840
See you

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,040
She bought books with Huozi Dongzi and left

10
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Why does this girl think of buying books?

11
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,800
You buy books. Isn't this with Weimin

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Dong Zi also went

13
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
This Xiaomin in your family

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,520
Anywhere is fine

15
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
I just don't like to talk

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm bored with this jujube sister

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
You are the master who keeps his mouth shut all day

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
How to give birth to a stuffy gourd

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,640
Maybe I love talking too much

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,120
God thinks I'm in a panic

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Let me have a daughter who doesn't like to talk

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,320
I think this is really reliable

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,520
Gangzi is coming back with his daughter-in-law

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
What time does the train arrive

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,080
It will arrive in a long time

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,480
I let the two hadrons

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,960
Ask for leave and pick them up

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,520
It's been ten years since Gangzi left

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,320
That's right

30
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,000
In 1979, the educated youth returned to the city

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,760
But he just won't listen to me

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
Married a local rural daughter-in-law

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,920
I didn't wander back to our capital until now

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Just come back

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
Then where will they live when they come back

36
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,280
Am I not worried about this

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
You see, I have only one bright, two dark and three rooms

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,760
The old man and the two hadrons squeezed into a room

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Can't you let me and Juanzi

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Sleep in a room with Gangzi and his wife

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
Sister Xiulan

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Brother Tong

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,000
Sister Xiulan, don't worry

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,320
I can't. I'll spare a room there

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
Let them live in the young couple

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,360
Don't, Big Brother

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,480
That room of yours

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,160
It's reserved for coal cores

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,800
What if he comes back one day

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
Where does he live

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
You have touched a sore spot

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Why are you carrying coal cores

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Look at my smelly mouth

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
How did you forget this crop

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Sister Xiulan

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
Let me give you an idea

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Then say it quickly, Brother Suo

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,080
You just follow there

59
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,440
To Gangzi and his wife

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
Isn't it over to build one

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
To tell you the truth, Big Brother

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
It's not that I haven't made an idea

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
But isn't there another tree

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
I can't just build a house

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
Let's cut down that tree

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,320
It's not easy yet

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
If you build this tree in the house, it will be over

68
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,240
No, that tree can

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,959
That's not big enough

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,680
That's right

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
How about you two

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
Is it a lump in one's head

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
Use that cloister, too

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
Isn't it big like this

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,080
Besides

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
What happened to a tree

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Isn't this really helpless

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
Don't say this idea is reliable

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,080
But you are by the window of my big brother

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,040
Build a house

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,200
Can't that block half the sun

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
No, no, no

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
Can Brother Tong agree

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
What kind of person is Brother Tong

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
It's not like you don't know

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,840
So warm-hearted

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,120
I just said I was going to make room for him

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Can he still care about your half window

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
This will be angry

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,000
Wait for him to get better for a while

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
I'll talk to him for you

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
That's nice

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
Suo Dage Zao Jie

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
I thank my family for their son

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Polite

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
What to thank? It's not easy to thank children

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
You have to have a place to live when you come back. No

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,800
The brick and mortar that built the house

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
Are you ready

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
Er Hadron has been practicing stalls recently

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,400
Sell enemas after work

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Saved up a little, almost enough

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,960
Good

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,280
That

105
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,480
Dapeng left early

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,080
There is a shortage of hands when working at home

107
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,040
Let me know

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,760
Right right words

109
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,760
Come on

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Why are you so stunned

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Close the stall and leave

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
I'm leaving now

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,200
Push the cart. Hurry up

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
See you later. See you later

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
See you later, see you later

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Go, go, go

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
This one for the morning shift

118
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,520
What's wrong with this

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
Guys, I'll go upside down first

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Then I went back to dream of a beautiful girl

121
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
See you at twelve o'clock in the evening

122
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Go away

123
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
Which is this? This is

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Don't know

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,760
Don't people change their spiritual food

126
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,800
That's right

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
Let's have some more of this material

128
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
That's right, that's right

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,280
I can't compare with brother. I really can't compare with this

130
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,800
I said Dong Zi

131
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
I kind of convinced you

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,920
How does your brain move

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
It's still moving

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Think for yourself

135
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
Hundreds of people don't sleep at night

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Run to the door of the bookstore

137
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Go in line to buy that famous book

138
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,200
Then can this book be worthless, right

139
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Let me tell you two

140
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
I really regret it a little

141
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,040
I just turned it over a somersault

142
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
I knew I'd somersault them

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,840
Dong Zi is just one word cow

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,280
Let me tell you two

145
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,240
Follow me if you want to make money in the future

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,880
Make sure you are popular and spicy

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
There is wine to drink every day

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,960
Dong Zi, don't say you have wine to drink every day

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm starving right now

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,480
Walking steamed buns and fried liver Dongge is enough

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,960
Go eat fried liver

152
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,760
Come on, don't cry

153
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
So is this Xiulan

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,960
It's very good

155
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
What are you doing with that bastard

156
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Who the fuck

157
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Coal nuclear is not a bastard

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
He's not an asshole

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,280
All you know is that money

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Nonsense

161
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,440
What do you eat without money

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
What does our son Blue Flag eat

163
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,400
When it comes to this blue flag,

164
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
I managed to be in the factory

165
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,760
Tell the leader to let him take over the shift

166
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,160
He's good

167
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,240
Idle around in the factory all day, steal and cheat

168
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,960
You can't eat any bitterness

169
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,480
Still absent from work for three days and two ends

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm in the factory

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
People point at my back

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Poke me in the spine

173
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,280
Said I gave birth to a loafer

174
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,120
I have no place to put my face

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Let the factory leader criticize him for two words

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
He's good

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
I almost quit

178
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
It's all your fault

179
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
He doesn't want to make progress and doesn't like to work

180
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
Is it my fault

181
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
You can't carry the blue flag on this shoulder

182
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,520
A loafer phase that can't be lifted by hand

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,240
It's all up to you

184
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,960
Don't you say that

185
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,800
When I go to work,

186
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,520
He is also an activist in the unit

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,360
Why doesn't he learn from me if he is good

188
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,760
That's right

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,280
It's all due to that smelly boy in Dong Zi

190
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,800
And Xiulan's family Juan

191
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,840
They all put our blue flag

192
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,880
The soul was hooked away

193
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,520
Leave a serious job alone

194
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,400
Idle every day

195
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,080
Chasing behind their ass

196
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
Follow them to set up cigarette stalls and do small business

197
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
You really don't say it

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,280
I think the blue flag boy is quite up to the road

199
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,960
He knows how to make money by doing business

200
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
It's been so long

201
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,040
At least the child didn't tell our old couple

202
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
Reach for the money

203
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,880
It's much better than the one who eats dad and drinks mom

204
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
What is strong?

205
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,720
Do you know that these people

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,200
All in charge of the street stalls

207
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
What's it called

208
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Call a profiteer

209
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
How ugly it sounds

210
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,360
I don't think so

211
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Isn't it

212
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Make money by doing business with one's own hands

213
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
What's wrong with it

214
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
Line line line

215
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
I knew it

216
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,520
Everyone in the factory said that our son had gone to practice stalls

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,880
Joke at me

218
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Shame

219
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960
Why are you crying again

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,200
Come on, have some water. Have some water

221
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,920
Don't cry

222
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,080
You drink some hot porridge first

223
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Really

224
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,960
Know that you have to queue up to buy books

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
Why don't you put on more clothes

226
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,360
On an ad hoc basis

227
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,400
That's what you young people are like

228
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
Think of one is one

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Let's freeze all night

230
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,040
It's not frozen

231
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,640
Dong Zi gave me his clothes

232
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
Dong Zi, this child knows how to care about people

233
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,080
Wasn't Wai-min with you all the time

234
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
Talking to you

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
Mom, I'm sleepy. I'll go to bed first

236
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Why didn't he give you his clothes

237
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,960
Huozi Sanliang steamed stuffed bun and two bowls of fried liver

238
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Huozi Sanliang steamed stuffed bun and two bowls of fried liver

239
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,160
You are really good enough to eat

240
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
Then what's wrong? Don't eat for nothing

241
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Went to Ho Fung Hotel last night

242
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,640
You didn't eat less or drink less

243
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,880
And now you're eating a bunch

244
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,200
You're not afraid to hold on

245
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm happy to hold on to it

246
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Anyway, I don't earn less money today

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Come on, you two

248
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
Can you stop arguing

249
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
This is the money you borrowed from your neighbors

250
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,240
Give it back quickly

251
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,880
Don't worry, I finally borrowed it

252
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Two more days

253
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Make what make

254
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
The old saying goes well

255
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,200
It is not difficult to borrow well and then borrow again

256
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,600
Besides

257
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,840
The money was borrowed in the name of Ren Xiaomin

258
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
Don't you give it back quickly

259
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,840
Xiaomin has no face

260
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,560
Is that Dong Zi is right

261
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,520
Rest assured

262
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,720
I'll go door to door and give it back to them in a minute

263
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,280
Come

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,600
This is the money we earned today

265
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,920
I divided it into three parts

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,080
One for each of the three of us

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,640
How embarrassed to hold this

268
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Do you still have a time to be embarrassed

269
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,120
Dong Zi

270
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
You came up with the idea

271
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,080
You should take the big head

272
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,440
Come on, who are the three of us with who

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
Take it if you want it. Hurry up

274
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,000
Dong Zi asked you to take it, so you can take it

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,560
What are you being polite about

276
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,080
Row

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Come on, that's it.

278
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,280
Let's go to twelve o'clock this evening

279
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,720
Then the subway station covers an area

280
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
All right

281
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
Yesterday, I went to the street office for a meeting

282
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,440
Director Hong Ying conveyed it to me

283
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
The situation and some problems in Beijing

284
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
Now, I will convey it to everyone

285
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,920
Beijing has a large number of educated youths returning to the city recently

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,600
There are so many more

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
Unemployed youth who have not been admitted to universities

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
But what about factories and enterprises

289
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,920
We can't arrange so many unemployed people at once

290
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,520
Then these people will have nothing to do all day

291
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,960
Some of them secretly start small businesses

292
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,400
Some just hang out in the society

293
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,320
In view of the serious social problems at present,

294
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,800
The leaders of the central and municipal governments decided

295
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,600
Great efforts should be made to rectify

296
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,520
What about the tasks of our neighborhood committees

297
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Is to tell the educated youth of our segment

298
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,960
And these unemployed youths

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
It is necessary to strengthen management

300
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,560
This is very important

301
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,040
Especially for those released from two jobs

302
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
Focus on supervision

303
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
Although we don't have to ask for instructions early and report late

304
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,040
But we have to conduct household surveys frequently

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Understand their ideological trends

306
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Put all the signs of crime

307
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
To be strangled in the cradle

308
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,880
Director

309
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm now from morning till night

310
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,040
Run from house to house every day

311
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,760
The heels don't touch the ground

312
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,520
That's a lot of good things to say

313
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,120
But those educated youths who returned to the city

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
There are also unemployed youth

315
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
And the two laborers

316
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
Then they have to eat, too

317
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,880
A young man of that age won't be assigned a job

318
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
Eat home every day

319
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,920
Can he be emotionless

320
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,080
Is

321
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,080
At the beginning

322
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,440
There are also some young people

323
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
Reading at home

324
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,200
Prepare to repeat the college entrance examination

325
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
But it's not so easy

326
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,320
These educated youths

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,480
This cultural foundation is inherently poor

328
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,920
No matter how you study, you can't get into college, can you

329
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,520
Be depressed at home

330
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
Why don't you go out and wander around

331
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,880
Don't you talk about him

332
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,680
Just the big boy in our family

333
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,080
You said it's been years since you came back

334
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Run to that street office every day to find a job

335
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,560
Don't you think there are any jobs for them

336
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,360
Isn't that right

337
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
With a few of his friends

338
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,000
Go to the open space in front of Xidan Clothing Building

339
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,360
It's selling clothes

340
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
Don't say it yet

341
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,440
The money coming down this month

342
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,080
Which year did we earn it

343
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,040
Look at others

344
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
Really big sister

345
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,440
How much money do you earn? It's really good

346
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
It's awesome

347
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,720
I want to go

348
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay

349
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,000
Let me tell you something

350
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,600
This business is a practice stall for board masters

351
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
It's not always a good thing

352
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Then you said so many educated youths

353
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,240
So many unemployed youths go to practice stalls

354
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Our city of Beijing is not messed up

355
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,280
You, pay attention

356
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Get your big boy under control

357
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
Tell him to put away the stall quickly

358
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,480
It's no use saying it

359
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,000
If you want to say it, go ahead and say it

360
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,800
I'll say it as soon as I say it

361
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
When will he be at home? I'll go

362
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,960
Who cares about others

363
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,599
Take care of your own girl

364
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,440
Is

365
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You mean me

366
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,160
Director

367
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,399
I heard that

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,040
Your Xiaomin and that Weidong

369
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,360
And that Juanzi

370
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,840
And the one named Huozi

371
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,760
That's Soqian's son

372
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,080
Call it Solan Flag

373
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,718
Right

374
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,000
They set up cigarette stalls at the subway entrance

375
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
There is such a thing

376
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,199
You talk nonsense

377
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm not talking nonsense at all

378
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,959
Someone saw it

379
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
That Weidong and that Juanzi

380
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,680
They sell cigarettes there every day

381
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,520
Their family Xiaomin is also there

382
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,360
She doesn't care about their family

383
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,680
I still care about others. I don't even care about my own children

384
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,280
Regardless of her children

385
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Do you think so

386
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,960
Right? Is there one like this

387
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,800
It's out of control

388
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,120
Just do what

389
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
I can't manage my own family affairs

390
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,360
Really good

391
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,480
Three thousand six big trippers

392
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,960
Small trippers race cow hair

393
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,080
Although the tricks are different,

394
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,640
But each has its own ingenuity

395
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,600
Remember it all for me

396
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
Remember, remember

397
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,080
Remember

398
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,760
Remember

399
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,360
Remember, remember

400
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,480
You guys keep practicing

401
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,440
Chief director

402
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,760
You are not busy in the neighborhood Committee

403
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,120
Why did you come here to inspect the work?

404
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
Don't be poor with me

405
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,560
Do you know

406
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
Your precious girl

407
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,800
Now I practice stalls with Dong Zi at the subway entrance all day

408
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,320
You're out of your mind

409
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,000
You sit down for a while

410
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,720
I won't sit

411
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,360
What am I supposed to do

412
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,600
What's the big deal

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Xiaomin

414
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
I didn't even get into college for two years

415
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
You, the great director, carry forward the style again

416
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Talking about so many unemployed youths and educated youths returning to the city

417
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
I haven't even arranged a job

418
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,720
I just don't want to go to the office

419
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,360
Find someone to trust a relationship

420
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Arrange a job for Xiaomin

421
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,960
Then our daughter can't spend all day

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
Stay idle at home

423
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,240
Follow Dong Zi Juanzi Huozi and them

424
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
Set up a cigarette stand to earn some pocket money

425
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,000
What's the matter

426
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,360
Then you knew about it

427
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,080
I know

428
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,440
Then why didn't you tell me

429
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,200
There are so many things in your neighborhood Committee

430
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
As busy as something

431
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Don't put you in trouble with this thing at home

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,800
Do you know

433
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm in a neighborhood meeting today

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
I told them

435
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
Let them take care of their children

436
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Don't sneak around doing business all day

437
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,600
When the board master practices stalls

438
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
This is not right

439
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,240
As a result, people

440
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,520
Say you don't care about us

441
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,920
Mind your own children

442
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,560
You said

443
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
I am the director of the neighborhood Committee

444
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,760
How do you say you want me to be

445
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,000
Keep your voice down

446
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,920
Old woman

447
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
When you were pregnant, you were too busy

448
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
I didn't keep it

449
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
We have a child in middle age

450
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,280
It's hard to have Xiaomin, a girl

451
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,400
This is a knot in one's heart

452
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,400
Besides

453
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
The child has grown so big

454
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
When has it ever been a jam for us

455
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Who doesn't say you have a good girl in the neighborhood

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,720
What's going on now

457
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Help Dong Zi sell a cigarette

458
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
You become a bad boy

459
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,440
Didn't say she was a bad child

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
I know Xiaomin is a good child

461
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,400
Let me tell you something

462
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,200
She learned from that Dongzi

463
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,120
Let that Dong Zi be slapped and broken

464
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,840
I'll find the red tassel

465
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,800
I'm looking for his mother

466
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
See if she cares

467
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,960
Don't you go

468
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,960
You leave me alone

469
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You leave me alone

470
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Let me tell you something

471
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,360
That smelly son of yours

472
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,520
I didn't come back all night last night

473
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Idle around all day and make trouble

474
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
Just now his brother told me

475
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Fighting with others again outside

476
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,240
Yes

477
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,640
I can't blame him either

478
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,680
Is not a reading material

479
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,000
Fail to get into college

480
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,560
Well, then mix with society

481
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
You blame me for that

482
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
I said before that trustee

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Let him work in the police

484
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,200
You disagree

485
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,960
You are awake and say you can't go through the back door

486
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,240
After that

487
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Your street office

488
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
Got him a job in the factory

489
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,760
I called someone in a few days

490
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,480
It got us to go to the factory

491
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
Bow and kowtow and say good things

492
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,520
I called someone again two days later

493
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
Let the factory open

494
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,800
This boy has anti-bones on the back of his head when he hits him

495
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,840
This is a good soldier in the war years

496
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
Put it now

497
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,880
Is a scourge

498
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,000
I really can't do anything about this son

499
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Mom

500
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
You are the director of the big street office

501
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Who can't help it again

502
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,440
You come here

503
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,040
Stand here, stand here, stand right

504
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,040
I didn't come back last night, did I

505
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,640
I went to fight with others again

506
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
Lin Weimin

507
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,200
The whole thing is a traitor

508
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,560
You're the traitor

509
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,920
Return the traitor

510
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,200
Not bashful to say it.

511
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,040
Dad

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,120
Calm down, please

513
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
This is a bottle of Luzhou Old Cellar

514
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,560
A bottle of Yanghe Daqu

515
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,760
It's all your favorite wines

516
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,520
And that Marlboro

517
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,080
And that, that Hilton

518
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,800
Serious foreign trade goods

519
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,360
Honor your

520
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
Where did you get it

521
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
That

522
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
Why aren't you

523
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,520
I-I'm telling you

524
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
I made a small cultural fortune

525
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Didn't do anything bad

526
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't do this

527
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,520
I'm telling you

528
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
You go to that

529
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,680
Cigarette stalls at the subway entrance

530
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,840
The masses reacted badly

531
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,760
Many people come to me to complain

532
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm telling you

533
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,760
These people just can't eat grapes and say grapes are sour

534
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm jealous to see me earn some money

535
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,320
You talk nonsense

536
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm not talking nonsense

537
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,640
You see me too

538
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
A big boy over one meter eight

539
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
I can't reach out every day

540
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,960
The housekeeper wants money, doesn't he

541
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
How shameful it is to spread out

542
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,840
Isn't that right, Dad

543
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,720
Children have a point in saying this

544
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
He lives hard by doing so

545
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,920
What do you know

546
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,840
What do I know

547
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
What do I know

548
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,120
Of course I can know

549
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,200
At present, the state has no explicit prohibition

550
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,480
Unemployed youth set up stalls to do business with educated youth returning to the city

551
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
For this phenomenon,

552
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
The government is now studying

553
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,280
The policy will be introduced immediately

554
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,440
Guide and manage these people

555
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
These spirits

556
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,200
Didn't your street office convey it earlier

557
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480
Isn't it settled yet

558
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,680
Mom

559
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,560
That

560
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,520
Then we'll talk when it's settled.

561
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
I haven't slept all night

562
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll go back to sleep first

563
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,520
Go back to Dad

564
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,200
Take this away

565
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
Honor you and keep it

566
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
Red Tassel Sister

567
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,760
Jujube, come on, come on

568
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,720
Elder sister

569
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
My big brother is at home, too

570
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,320
Director Lin Da

571
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Now the society is so chaotic

572
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
The leader of your police station

573
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,760
Is it in charge or no matter

574
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
How do you know we don't care

575
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
Who says we don't care

576
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440
Say what I don't like to hear

577
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,240
Okay, you guys talk

578
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,360
How did you meet our old Lin

579
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,640
There is no good thing to say

580
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't you remember that thing before liberation

581
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,480
I don't see a good word for him

582
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
I don't see anything nice about you yet

583
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,960
What's the matter

584
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,120
Your Dongzi is outrageous

585
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,040
Put up cigarette stalls at the subway entrance every day

586
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,280
Set it yourself

587
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,960
I also dragged our Xiaomin

588
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,200
I officially told you today

589
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,720
It depends on whether you care or not

590
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,040
He just fell asleep

591
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Let's scream

592
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,400
What time is it

593
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,120
Gangzi, the boy should be here by now

594
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,800
It should be almost soon

595
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,560
Mom

596
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,880
Mom, my brother is here

597
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,400
Gangzi

598
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,760
Grandpa

599
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Mom

600
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
This

601
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,080
Call someone

602
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Grandparents

603
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,120
Grandpa

604
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,560
Mom

605
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
Gangzi

606
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,080
You Xiong Haizi, you still know to come back

607
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,480
Dong Zi

608
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Wake up and don't sleep

609
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,880
Get up, get up, get up

610
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
Why are you sleeping

611
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,080
You hurry up

612
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,080
Get up quickly and ask you something

613
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
You said

614
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
What's the matter with Xiaomin

615
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
What? What's going on

616
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,320
Just this morning, this gang of hooligans took the guy

617
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
To beat you up

618
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm telling you

619
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm going to die with them

620
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,840
But he looked at Xiaomin, a little girl

621
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,760
Which station

622
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,120
I didn't say anything

623
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
The hooligans turned and ran away

624
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,480
Why

625
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time

626
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,920
This is illogical

627
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,040
I can't figure it out for a long time

628
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
You tell me something about it

629
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,280
You still claim to know Xiaomin yourself

630
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
You don't even know that

631
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,520
You live in vain

632
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,000
Think about it for yourself

633
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,080
Don't sleep. I'll ask you something serious

634
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
Come on, come on, you get up. Get up

635
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
If you have something to say, just say it

636
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,920
Well, let me ask you something

637
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,200
This Xiaomin is not a hooligan, is she

638
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,240
Where are you, a talented woman and hooligan

639
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,000
Then you tell me

640
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,240
Why

641
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,840
Why do these male hooligans see her

642
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
They all ran away

643
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I kind of see it

644
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
If I don't make it clear to you

645
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
You won't let me sleep soundly, will you

646
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,280
Yeah, I'm here to get to the bottom of it

647
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,080
You go ahead

648
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,080
Get

649
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,800
Then I'll talk to you in vernacular

650
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,640
Let me tell you this

651
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,520
Not only Tu Liuzi

652
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,360
Our Hutong Strings in Shichahai

653
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,280
Local ruffians and hooligans

654
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,840
There is no one who is not afraid to see Xiaomin

655
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,040
You tell me why

656
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,480
Why

657
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,440
Because Xiaomin's mother, aunt jujube

658
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,920
Jujube aunt

659
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,600
Right

660
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,040
What do you think Aunt Jujube does

661
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,560
At the time of liberation,

662
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,920
Is the director of the neighborhood Committee

663
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,880
Our neighborhood

664
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Who hasn't received her favor?

665
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,440
Let's not talk about favors

666
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,720
You think about it

667
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,120
Aunt Zaoyi has been doing so many years

668
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,080
For the neighbors in Shichahai,

669
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,520
That's really diligent and hard-working

670
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,320
Send warm of every household

671
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
Who has something to do with his family

672
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,640
What kind of dispute is there in the neighborhood

673
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,120
It was jujube aunt who came forward to help solve it

674
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,800
Right

675
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,760
You see, there are still our children

676
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,120
Not all of them grew up watching Jujube aunt

677
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,240
Especially those who are a little bit

678
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,440
That's the key supervision object of the street

679
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,320
That jujube aunt can't wait

680
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Go to their house every day

681
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,920
Go and do ideological education for them

682
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
These kids

683
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Meet Aunt Jujube

684
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,200
It's like a mouse seeing a cat

685
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
You can run three miles by listening

686
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,120
Let me tell you this

687
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,720
Don't talk about bullying Xiaomin

688
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
You don't need jujube aunt to come forward

689
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Their own parents

690
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,840
You have to beat them half to death

691
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
You have to say this

692
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,240
It makes sense

693
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,240
Who is Aunt Jujube

694
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
Who dares to mess with Aunt Jujube

695
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,160
If this provokes Xiaomin, it will be tantamount to

696
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,080
Irritated Aunt Jujube

697
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,320
Why didn't I come up with such a simple truth

698
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,160
What you think about every day

699
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,960
They are all poetry, prose and novels

700
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,960
Those eyeballs are as high as the roof

701
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,760
When have you ever looked down

702
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,440
Am I like this

703
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,360
Don't squeeze the right people

704
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,040
Squeezing is what you do

705
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,400
Listen or not listen or not listen

706
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,560
Not in the back. There's more

707
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,600
Come on, come on, you talk, you talk

708
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
Let me tell you this

709
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,960
Don't look at our dad as a public security cadre

710
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
But our children in this area

711
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,920
No one is afraid of him

712
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,920
Nonsense

713
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,360
What do you mean, nonsense

714
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,680
Think about it yourself with your pig brain

715
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Our children

716
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
Take a woman and have a fight

717
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,200
Do something about the miscellaneous glazed balls (not serious)

718
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,680
That can't get out of the big circle and can't break the law

719
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,200
It's not in our dad's charge

720
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,600
So no one is afraid of our dad

721
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,760
Of course

722
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
No one will be afraid of me

723
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,440
But the big and small things on this street

724
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
Can all be managed by neighborhood committees

725
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,480
Aunt Jujube, that's a positive difference

726
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,480
So these children are afraid of her

727
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,480
And then there is

728
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,520
Xiaomin's father, Uncle Tiedan

729
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,560
At the time of liberation,

730
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,000
It is the second division of the public security department of the city bureau

731
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,920
Plainclothes

732
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,200
Scout hero

733
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,840
How many spies have been arrested and how many cases have been solved

734
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,480
Of course

735
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,280
At that time

736
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,600
Said he was suspected of being a spy

737
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,480
Was cleared out of the public security team

738
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Down and out to Shichahai Sports School

739
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,280
Being a wrestling coach

740
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,840
But people have real kung fu

741
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,240
The famous wrestling king in the capital area

742
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,480
The apprentice who learned to fall with him has gone to sea

743
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
That's in the city of 49

744
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,840
It is also a famous No.1 person

745
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,560
Dare to bully his daughter

746
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,080
That's pure shuffle when I get tired of living, isn't it

747
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,800
Make sense

748
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,320
Make sense

749
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,560
Okay, I see

750
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,720
Okay, I'm okay

751
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,880
You, you go back to sleep

752
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
Why didn't I figure it out? I'm here

753
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,080
Why am I sleeping if you wake up with me

754
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,280
You say how annoying you are. You

755
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,040
Mom, what do you eat at night

756
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,280
Fried shredded pork with tomato, egg and green pepper

757
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,320
Eggplant with minced meat

758
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,720
Are you tired of eating this old three again

759
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,600
Do you like it

760
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,440
You go out to eat by yourself

761
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,560
Well, I went out to find a way to eat.

762
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,480
Wait

763
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
I still have something to ask you

764
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
What instructions do you have

765
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,400
Your aunt came to see me at noon today

766
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,080
You and I are almost in no hurry

767
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,000
You two sisters quarreled and bickered for three days and two ends

768
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,600
Isn't that normal to be anxious with you

769
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,640
We all fight about work

770
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,840
Today, aunt jujube, that's for you

771
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
It's for me

772
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,880
Don't pay me a price. I didn't greet the old lady

773
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
Okay, I'm going to recruit her

774
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,200
Can I still have a good life

775
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,040
You really don't have a good life

776
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,280
Let me ask you something

777
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,840
You put up a cigarette stand to embarrass me and your father

778
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
We turn a blind eye

779
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,800
Can't manage

780
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,520
But I heard Aunt Jujube say

781
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
You let Xiaomin accompany you to practice stalls

782
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,080
Someone else Xiaomin's child

783
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,400
A quiet child

784
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,680
You let people do this

785
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,920
Are you embarrassed? You

786
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,480
No, no, mom

787
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,320
Heaven and earth conscience

788
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
I really didn't pull Xiaomin

789
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
Go to the practice booth with me

790
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,960
That's Xiaomin. She has nothing to do

791
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
Go to the cigarette stall and find me Juanzi Huozi

792
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,920
Have a chat together

793
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,240
Really

794
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,320
But to be honest

795
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
I really want Xiaomin to

796
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,800
Doing business with me

797
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
But people don't want to do it either, do they

798
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,880
No

799
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm telling you, I'm still

800
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,520
I really need to find the old lady to have a good talk

801
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,400
This can't make me take the blame for nothing

802
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,120
If you say so,

803
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm still practical in my heart

804
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,680
In time for tomorrow

805
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,280
Have a good talk with Aunt Zao

806
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,680
Otherwise, she won't spare you

807
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,640
You can rest assured, Mom

808
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,080
With your son's three-inch tongue,

809
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,600
Two lines of clever teeth

810
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,520
You can definitely make Jujube Aunt's face round

811
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,920
Tell me to grow up.

812
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,400
Besides

813
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,840
Aunt Jujube hurts me the most when she is young, doesn't she

814
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Sit and sit

815
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,080
I still have something to ask you

816
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,720
You said

817
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,480
I know you like Xiaomin

818
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,600
What about you two? We grew up together

819
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
It's a childhood sweetheart

820
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,280
How are you two getting along

821
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,680
Did you mention it to her directly

822
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,840
Oh, my God

823
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,160
I mentioned it to her

824
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,480
I said I liked her

825
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,160
I want her to be my girlfriend

826
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,360
But she never paid any attention to me

827
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,720
No way

828
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,360
Does she have someone she likes

829
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,160
I can't

830
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
She has no one in her heart but me

831
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,360
She, she ignored me.

832
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,080
It is because she has such a character

833
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,240
That, that

834
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,600
You've heard of the word Leng Yan Leng Yan

835
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,720
You use this word quite accurately

836
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,680
That child is giving people a kind of

837
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,200
An unattainable appearance

838
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:17,120
Right, right, right

839
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
How did you say that again

840
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,719
Cold face and hot heart

841
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,680
To put it bluntly, I am embarrassed

842
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,759
By the way, mom

843
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:28,440
Plus, have you ever heard that sentence

844
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:31,640
If you are not afraid of no good, you are afraid of no good

845
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,040
There is a big shit stick between Xiaomin and me

846
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,919
If it weren't for this shit stick

847
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
Maybe we'll be fine by now

848
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,640
Who's the shit stick? Who's the shit stick

849
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:41,520
Lin Weimin

850
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,319
Your brother

851
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,600
It is impossible

852
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,920
How many years are there between them

853
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,120
Real mom

854
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm telling you

855
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,680
My brother is a valve core

856
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,160
Do you know

857
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:53,000
You say who he likes at his age is not good

858
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,080
He has to like Xiaomin

859
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,318
Then it's okay to always gather around Xiaomin

860
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,680
What poetry meeting does that always take Xiaomin to

861
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,240
I also encouraged Xiaomin to go to college

862
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,480
He also said that he would put Xiaomin

863
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,720
Get their magazine

864
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,920
I know your brother often looks for Xiaomin

865
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,560
I thought it was a brother

866
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,000
Help Xiaomin make progress

867
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I really didn't think about it

868
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,400
But when you say so,

869
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,320
With their interests and hobbies

870
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
It's really a little like-minded

871
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,880
Come on, mom

872
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,240
You, you just said

873
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,600
We were childhood sweethearts

874
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,280
Now why are they two

875
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,880
Like-minded again

876
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,640
That's all I'll say

877
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,280
Mom

878
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,480
Mom

879
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm telling you I'm your old son

880
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
You baby pimples

881
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
In the face of this kind of right and wrong,

882
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,560
You have to have a position

883
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,400
Then your brother is also my own son

884
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,040
What do you want me to do as a mother

885
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Mom

886
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,760
You said who you two like

887
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
Why do everyone like Xiaomin

888
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,640
What an enemy

889
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,000
Mom

890
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,480
A big girl's family runs wildly outside all day

891
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,960
Make a public appearance

892
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,960
I also practice cigarette stalls

893
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm shabby for her

894
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,520
Mom, don't talk about me

895
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,200
Do you believe that I am the only one who practices cigarette stalls

896
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,160
Dad, can you believe it? Is it possible

897
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,880
Then why did you go to see heaven and earth here

898
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,000
I am idle and bored during the day

899
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,440
Looking for Dong Zi Huozi Juanzi, them

900
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,160
The chat has gone to amuse the stuffy

901
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm full and I'm going in

902
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,560
Look at that

903
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
It's not big or small, is it

904
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,240
I'm not saying anything

905
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,600
I hit the south wall

906
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,200
Still laughing

907
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
My prestige is getting lower and lower now

908
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
I figured it out

909
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,960
The man in the world who can cure you

910
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,960
That is, you are a precious girl

911
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,240
You are used to educating people with long speeches

912
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,680
Others can't refuse to listen to you

913
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,920
Our daughter won't eat you

914
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,360
You can't help it yet

915
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,560
Go? Go? Go, you

916
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,080
Find a cup to drink

917
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm not done here. You sit down

918
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
Have to lead

919
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,040
You go on to say

920
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,720
Say

921
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Too lazy to tell you

922
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
This is too much

923
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,520
Mom can't eat

924
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,040
Your grandfather hasn't cooked in years

925
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,480
Happy to see you come back

926
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,160
You have to cook yourself

927
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,000
Make you a delicious meal

928
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,560
Come on, don't say it

929
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,440
Eat quickly

930
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,000
Son eats

931
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Sister-in-law eats

932
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,000
Aunt-in-law eats

933
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,920
Is it fragrant

934
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,440
The fragrance is too fragrant

935
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Slow down, slow down

936
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,840
It's time for Gangzi to go back

937
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,200
Let me see

938
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You clean up later

939
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,400
I

940
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,520
Slow down, slow down

941
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,880
It's not enough. Mom will do it for you again

942
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,040
Sister-in-law

943
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,600
You also move chopsticks and eat quickly

944
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm I'm full

945
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm not hungry

946
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,560
Shirley, I came to see the children

947
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,160
Jujube sister jujube aunt

948
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,520
I'm eating

949
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,040
Jujube aunt

950
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
What's wrong with Jujube Sister

951
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
This is Gangzi

952
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,080
It's on the opposite side of the street

953
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,280
I really can't recognize it

954
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,840
Much stronger

955
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,560
This is your daughter-in-law

956
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
Ah, aunt jujube

957
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,160
Jujube aunt

958
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,960
At first glance, it is a farmer's child

959
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,000
True simplicity

960
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,800
Sit down and eat

961
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Sit down with Aunt Jujube

962
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,960
I'm finished

963
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,280
I just wanted to ask

964
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,680
How do children live? You guys

965
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Brother Tong said

966
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,560
Make do with the coal core house for a few days first

967
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,920
Don't move here until the house is built

968
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,960
Yecheng

969
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,400
Are you ready for the two hadrons

970
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,960
All the materials are ready. Pull it over tomorrow

971
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,360
That is, it will start tomorrow

972
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,920
Right

973
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,760
That's great

974
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,240
Dong Zi

975
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,360
You said we had a good life

976
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,240
Why are you like a night owl

977
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,160
This family sleeps and we go out to the stall

978
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,960
I sleep when people go to work

979
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,840
This whole thing is upside down

980
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,720
Think of me as happy

981
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,360
I don't want to go to bed early and get up early like others

982
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
But isn't there no way

983
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,320
If you don't want to leave the stall late,

984
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,080
That becomes

985
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,800
Let's do it in the morning from tomorrow

986
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,560
Don't

987
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,480
You go out this morning

988
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
How far does that line have to go

989
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,360
At least more than others

990
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,120
Practice for three or four hours more

991
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
No, no, no, no

992
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,520
That's right

993
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,240
Everyone knows

994
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,640
It's near the subway entrance

995
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,000
Many customers, good business and fast sales

996
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,200
Instead of spending three or four hours behind it,

997
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,160
It is better to get up early and collect early

998
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,720
Go home and have a good sleep

999
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,920
Now that everyone understands this truth,

1000
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
Then don't complain

1001
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Count it. I didn't say

1002
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,840
Dong Zi

1003
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,560
Where did we take the lead today

1004
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,240
Wrong, Dong Zi

1005
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,320
There is no figure in this person

1006
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,360
There is a string of bricks in this area

1007
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
It's getting more and more unruly

1008
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,680
People don't come and get a broken brick

1009
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
Give me land here

1010
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,280
Gap kicked me

1011
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,400
Take a break

1012
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,520
What's the matter, Dong Zi

1013
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,600
Didn't you tell us not to rob the land with us

1014
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,640
Come so early again

1015
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,960
Yeah, my spiritual food is sold out

1016
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
I have to come back and practice my cigarette stand

1017
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't occupy a good position

1018
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
What time do I have to sell it tomorrow

1019
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,320
Right

1020
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,720
Dong Zi, I've been here a long time ago

1021
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,480
I put all the bricks

1022
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,960
Don't give me nonsense here

1023
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm telling you

1024
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
Don't you dare to deceive with bricks again

1025
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,840
Believe it or not, I'll film you

1026
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,680
Will you argue with me?

1027
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,720
I said guys

1028
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,320
Sell cigarettes during the day

1029
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,240
Come here to set up a stall in the middle of the night

1030
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,680
Do you think it's easy to earn some money

1031
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,640
It's good to have money to earn

1032
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,160
I'm telling you

1033
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,120
We have to think this way

1034
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
The money we earned from practicing cigarette stalls for one night

1035
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,160
That one for my brother

1036
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
A month's salary in the big editing room

1037
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,120
What are you not satisfied with

1038
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,320
You are right to say that

1039
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,720
Although people on the street

1040
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Look down on us small business people

1041
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,360
Say we are profiteers, Ban Ye

1042
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,480
Our Hutong

1043
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,000
No one is looking me in the eye

1044
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,760
But I'm making money

1045
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,400
My parents and grandparents every month

1046
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,360
You can eat eight pieces of Beijing in Daoxiang Village

1047
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,200
I see my grandma

1048
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,840
The happy expression of eating trough cake

1049
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,680
My heart is beautiful

1050
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,480
No matter how bitter and tired I am, I am worth it

1051
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,160
Really

1052
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,080
Guys, aren't they

1053
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,960
Right

1054
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,320
What you said is reliable

1055
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,840
It's a truth
