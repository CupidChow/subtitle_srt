1
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,920
Enemy at the Gates is stormy

2
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,600
I know how you feel at this moment

3
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Stationmaster Wang is gone

4
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Fu Zuoyi surrendered

5
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,800
The Communist Party will soon enter the city and take over Peiping

6
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,480
At this time when the party and the country are in danger,

7
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,840
Never be depressed

8
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
Don't forget

9
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,080
There is still half of the party and country

10
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Make great efforts to regroup

11
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,160
A comeback is just around the corner

12
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
Those present here

13
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
They are all loyal fighters of the party and the state

14
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Director Mao Renfeng values everyone

15
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,320
Put the glorious and arduous task of lurking in Peiping

16
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,960
Deliver to us

17
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,200
Cultivated by the Party and the state for many years

18
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,120
In order to cooperate with the party and the country to revitalize the mountains and

19
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
I ask all of you

20
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,240
Strictly implement Director Mao's

21
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
The strategy of integer retreat and zero advance

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
Our mission is to

23
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,320
Assassination, blasting, intelligence gathering

24
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,840
Organize an armed riot

25
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,400
In a word

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,840
The Communist Party occupying Peiping must not be allowed

27
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
Have a safe day

28
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
Brothers

29
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,519
At this moment in Peiping

30
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Who fought with us

31
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,240
There are thousands of party elites

32
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,720
Take out your blood

33
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Go to the end with the Communist Party

34
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,120
Remember the words of the chairman

35
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,680
If you don't succeed, you will become benevolent

36
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
If you don't succeed, you will become benevolent

37
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Go

38
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,120
Auntie is good and uncle is good

39
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
Have pity on me, a poor man

40
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
Give a bun and soup

41
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Wish you a long and healthy life

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
People who give you and don't give you parents are more beautiful than you

43
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
People pay you don't pay

44
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,400
People pee higher than you

45
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
Smelly beggar

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
If you don't fuck off, I'll slap you

47
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,760
You hit me and I lose. You're a little turtle

48
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,440
Smelly beggar

49
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
You want to die

50
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,120
Little Turtle Little Turtle

51
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
Little Turtle Little Turtle

52
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,200
Are you angry

53
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Come after me if you have the guts

54
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,400
If you can catch up with me today,

55
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,640
I call you Ye

56
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,160
Little bastard really wants to die

57
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
Run, run, run

58
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Walk, walk, walk

59
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,280
Upper

60
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Little rabbit

61
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Beat him up

62
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Hit

63
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,480
Go, go, go

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Upper

65
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
Hold him down and kill him

66
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,080
Withdraw

67
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Go

68
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,520
Sister windmill windmill

69
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
Sister, why doesn't this windmill turn

70
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Sister, let's have a look

71
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,760
Turn around and look at it

72
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Sister, give it to me. Give it to me

73
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll give it to you if you chase me

74
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,680
You can't catch it. You can't catch it

75
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,480
Uncle Qian

76
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,240
Jujube, you are really good

77
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,400
This time it is much more smooth than last time

78
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
You don't look at who I am

79
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Be careful in the future

80
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,640
Don't let the soldier catch you

81
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,520
I'll give you a black date then

82
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
You'll know who you are

83
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,840
The man who can hurt my jujube hasn't been born yet

84
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
You, you go crazy

85
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,680
I've seen wild ones

86
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,280
I've never seen you so wild

87
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
If your parents were alive,

88
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,960
You're the only one who scours

89
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,400
They must be pissed to death

90
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,040
Have a little

91
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,400
Take it

92
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,600
No, this is too much

93
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,640
You have to hold it

94
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,280
Jujube, you take these orphans with you

95
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,840
It is not easy to beg everywhere

96
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
This money should be collected

97
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,280
We should buy them some.

98
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
Eat and drink

99
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,080
Thank you, Uncle Qian

100
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
Here we go again, you guys

101
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Let's go

103
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
Boss

104
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,120
Give me the smallest cotton hat

105
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,920
There are small ones in front

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,640
That's it

107
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,680
This hair is as dirty as a hedgehog

108
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,160
Is it warm

109
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,200
Warm

110
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,720
Sister, I want it too

111
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Thank you

112
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,360
Our three melons and two dates

113
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,120
How can I buy so many cotton hats

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
Besides, the coal core is the youngest

115
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't argue with him

116
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,880
Come on, stop drooping your face

117
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
Nice job this morning

118
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
My sister treats you to eat delicious food

119
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,280
Is that all right

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,400
Good

121
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,600
Go away

122
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
You're here, too

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,920
What do you want to eat

124
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,640
What is this

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,160
You're here, too

126
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,640
That's good

127
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
This is really good

128
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Okay, okay, okay

129
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
Wait a minute. You are affected.

130
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
Give me a bowl of this. OK

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Not too much

132
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,920
Take it yourself

133
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Yes

134
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,920
Thank you.

135
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,360
All right

136
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,560
All right

137
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,040
Have another half bowl

138
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,240
Please put aside more leek flowers

Your uncle, you get it

150
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,480
Don't pull me. You can't trust me.

151
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,960
Hurry up

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,160
The brothers are hungry

153
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
That's all for today.

154

All the spoons in my hand are deep and slow

161

Fill up all the big bowls

162

Jujube, sit down

166

It's going to be right away

167

I have to say something about you today

172
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,960
Today, this belly is so hard that I can't bite it

173
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,960
You don't look like your usual craft at all

174
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,920
Jujube, I said

175

This is a war-torn place now

176
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,720
Where can I find you a good stomach

177
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,320
It's good to have this food

178
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's make do with it, shall we

179
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,080
It is reasonable to say

180
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,280
You are in charge this time

181
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,600
Eat more coals

182
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,560
Lai jujube

183
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,600
If you ask me, it's really thanks to you

184
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Otherwise, you said that on such a cold day

185
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't all these wild children have to lie down?

186
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,240
Don't you say that

187
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
They're just like me

188
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
No father or mother

189
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
I don't care who cares

190
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,720
Have to eat

191
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,560
How could I forget about it when it's over

192
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,600
My pig brain

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Jujube? Go

194
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,120
Don't ask, don't ask

195
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,200
You should all eat and drink

196
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
Don't forget the night

197
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,400
Get together in the old place, understand

198
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,360
Don't worry, sister

199
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,800
Fresh bean juice

200
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,520
Don't have another child

201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Pretty

202
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,400
Hey hook him up

203
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Good good

204
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,800
Go and study for a few more years

205
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,440
Didn't eat

206
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,360
Up, up, up

207
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Good good

209
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Okay, then throw it right

210
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,720
Almost

211
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,840
Come on, come on, get on your feet

212
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,800
Drop him and trip him

213
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,080
Throw his feet up and down

214
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,080
This iron egg and hole three

215
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,520
They are all masters of wrestling in Beijing

216
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,120
Yes

217
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,360
Look at their brothers meeting today

218
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
See who can give it to whom

219
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,320
Good

220
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,600
Come again

221
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,320
Come on

222
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't serve him

223
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, right

224
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,640
Push hard

225
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Come on, come on

226
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,520
Smelly manure

227
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,000
You have to be happy to make you like this

228
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Shame on grandma's house

229
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,880
Will you play or not

230
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Go down

231
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
It's not as good as a pussy

232
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,160
Be careful

233
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,520
Come on

234
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,280
Trip him. Trip him

235
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
What are you looking at me for

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Fall to the ground within five strokes

237
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,080
Don't say you know me

238
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Hurry up

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,880
Come

240
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
Get on your feet

241
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,480
Pay attention to your feet

242
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,480
Go well

243
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
Good

244
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,440
Good

245
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,320
Good

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,520
Not bad

247
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,600
The strength is OK

248
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Good fall

249
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,720
Just your loose-eyed kung fu

250
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,200
My dad taught you all these years

251
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,920
Sharp (falling) holes are all sharp

252
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,000
What's going on

253
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
Let me tell you what to do

254
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,480
When will you really become an iron egg

255
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,840
A famous man

256
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,520
If it's not me, you won't be a man.

257
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,720
You can ask about it in 49 cities

258
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,800
On the inside of the wrestling circle

259
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,320
My iron egg is a big number one

260
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Who can't call me Iron Master when he sees me?

261
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
It's just you who look down on me

262
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,240
Huan Tie Ye

263
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,080
I bah

264
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't, don't, don't have a nose

265
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
Kick and draw plates and kneel

266
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,880
Jumping arch slipper

267
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
Ba Na Li inverted hook

268
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,079
This wrestling is a technique handed down from our ancestors

269
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
What kind of spirit are you

270
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,560
I don't know why my dad took a fancy to you

271
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,000
Why do you have a crush on me

272
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,119
I'm telling you

273
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,599
My iron eggs are the same day

274
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,640
Master said

275
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,839
I am a good prospect of practicing wrestling once in a hundred years

276
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,040
You really don't refuse to accept me

277
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
I'm really much better than you

278
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,840
You have to be the same body as the same day

279
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Is to laugh at my anger from Shen

280
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,160
It's not the material for practicing wrestling

281
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,440
I didn't say that

282
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
This is what my master said. Your father said

283
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,280
I can see it today

284
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
You're not pissing me off today

285
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
You don't give up

286
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,680
Iron egg, I'm telling you

287
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
Don't brag in front of me

288
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,400
Not satisfied, right

289
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,640
If you don't accept it, take a fall and take a sharp hand

290
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,160
Let's stop it

291
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
Are you sure

292
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,760
Sharp (real fall) or fishy (performance)

293
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,680
Who do you despise? You

294
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
It's sharp

295
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,080
Cheng

296
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
Who is afraid of who is sharp?

297
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,680
It fell

298
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,120
Iron egg

299
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
I won't fall down for you today

300
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I take your last name

301
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,040
It's not jujube. Let's stop it

302
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
Play for real

303
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,960
Jujube

304
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,280
What's the matter

305
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
Jujube

306
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,080
You really threw me

307
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
It's not you who can't even fall me.

308
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
It's also iron master. Bah

309
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
Rabbit, you

310
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,080
Jujube

311
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,960
I think it's better to forget it today

312
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,040
Can I throw in the towel

313
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,040
I mean it

314
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Jujube

315
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,400
Jujube, don't practice

316
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Jujube

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
It really fell. This is terrible

318
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Jujube

319
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
This is a bad fall

320
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Jujube, are you all right? Jujube

321
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,680
Iron eggs are tough enough

322
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,240
Jujube

323
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,040
Why is the iron egg not light or heavy

324
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,240
Smelly iron egg, you really threw me. You

325
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,080
Jujube, get up, get up

326
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,320
You're rolling, rolling, rolling

327
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Let me see what's going on

328
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,000
Fuck off

329
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,280
Jujube

330
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,160
Let me have a look

331
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,360
You follow me again, you try

332
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,880
Jujube

333
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is Jujube all right

334
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Jujube

335
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,360
Jujube

336
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,440
Jujube sister, are you all right? Jujube sister

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Please show me the dates

338
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,680
Jujube

339
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,480
Jujube

340
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,000
Jujube

341
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,000
It's fun. You said you were still hard-handed

342
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Hard enough

343
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,600
Our families

344
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,280
Live for decades

345
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Get along like a family

346
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
That's right

347
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,200
Boss

348
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,440
You said Fu Zuoyi really surrendered

349
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
Aunt Li, this is not a surrender

350
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,000
It's called defection

351
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,920
No matter what you call it

352
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,960
I knew it

353
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,160
Our Beiping city is preserved

354
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
Unlimited merits and virtues

355
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,320
Jujube

356
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,040
Jujube

357
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,760
How did you do this

358
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,320
Who did it?

359
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,120
Aunt Li, look at your question

360
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,320
Who else can there be

361
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
It must be her enemy

362
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,960
The child

363
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
I don't know when you will come back.

364
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
I'll seal the stove for you

365
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
Worry about

366
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,680
Come and apply it with a hot jujube towel

367
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,160
Thank you, fourth brother

368
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,840
Thank you for what

369
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
I said Tian Zao

370
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
You're eighteen now

371
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,880
This day and night

372
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,800
Run about outside

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,080
Who dares to ask for you in the future

374
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,840
Aunt Li, you really don't worry about this

375
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Are you still afraid that no one wants jujube

376
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,360
Isn't this silly iron egg ready-made

377
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I'll marry him

378
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
He wants to be beautiful. He

379
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
Don't keep your mouth shut

380
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,440
Iron eggs grew up with you

381
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
It's not easy to have such a hot and cold person around

382
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,600
Don't bully him all the time

383
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,480
Aunt, what do you mean I bully him

384
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,200
Look at it

385
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,720
That's obviously him bullying me

386
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,080
You see, you see

387
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,960
Good

388
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't give me this set

389
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,440
You must have moved your hand first

390
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,480
Throw people in a hurry

391
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,280
Isn't it

392
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,440
Isn't it

393
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
Seriously

394
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
I see this iron egg

395
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,480
It's really so bloody

396
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
Dare to throw your little ancestor like this

397
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,400
It's a man

398
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,320
No

399
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,520
Which end are you two from

400
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,120
Which end

401
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
No matter which end

402
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,520
Wipe your face quickly and drink some water

403
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Don't be angry with me

404
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,680
I beg you, can't you

405
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,080
Just let me in

406
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,240
You made me kneel and rub the clothes board

407
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
I'll do whatever you want me to do

408
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,680
I just want to take a look

409
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
Are you seriously hurt or not

410
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Give me how far away it is to roll as far away as possible

411
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,160
I don't want to see you tonight. Go quickly

412
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,040
I

413
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,000
Row

414
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
If you don't let me see you

415
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,240
I won't leave today

416
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm telling you iron egg

417
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,800
I'll go out later

418
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
If I see you outside the door again,

419
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll never see you again in my life

420
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
I'll give you three numbers at last

421
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,680
1

422
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,400
II

423
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
The second half

424
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,720
III

425
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,480
Take care

426
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
Iron egg

427
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,360
Jujube

428
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,120
Your uncle

429
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,320
Are you going in the middle of the night

430
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,120
Uncle, I'm going out to do something

431
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,440
But I can't come back for a few days

432
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,520
Take care of the coal core for me

433
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
You can rest assured

434
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,880
Where are you going, sister

435
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm going with you, too

436
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,040
Coal core

437
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,160
Listen to my sister

438
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,440
While I was away

439
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,560
You have to listen to your uncle and Aunt Li

440
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,040
Don't give them any trouble

441
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you know

442
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,280
Go and see your sister when you are free

443
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,120
Do you remember

444
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,800
Sister, the windmill is really fun

445
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Wait for my sister to come back

446
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,320
Buy you a new windmill

447
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
Jujube jujube jujube

448
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
You tell your uncle the truth

449
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,720
What the hell are you doing there

450
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,200
Uncle, don't ask

451
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,800
Go away

452
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,040
It's not jujube

453
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,960
Go back

454
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,160
Elder sister

455
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,680
Han Qingkui's grandson

456
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,800
With his little wives

457
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Go to the opera in the theater

458
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,280
You really saw it

459
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,080
Don't worry, sister

460
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,160
You can't really go wrong

461
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,960
Cheng

462
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,720
You little brothers, get out of here quickly

463
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
Don't price, sister

464
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,560
Such a big thing

465
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,520
I must be by your side

466
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,600
This is my own business

467
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,880
It has nothing to do with any of you

468
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,920
Why doesn't it matter, sister

469
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,400
Your business is our big guy's business

470
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
That's right, jujube sister

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,280
I told you guys

472
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
Let me tell you something

473
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,160
If anyone dares to follow me today,

474
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Don't call me sister in the future

475
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,440
Don't say it. Listen to me. Come with me

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,560
Sister, you really have to be careful

477
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,120
Da Yong

478
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
The army will soon enter the city

479
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,720
While I was away

480
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,120
Watch it, everyone. Don't make trouble

481
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,080
Got it

482
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,360
Go quickly

483
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,240
Go

484
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,720
Brother Yong, let's just leave

485
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,880
Can you persuade her

486
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,840
Even if we follow

487
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
What can I do for you

488
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
It's not enough to fill the last (no use)

489
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
What then? What then

490
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,040
Stop yelling. Let me think

491
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Han Qingkui, I'll kill you

492
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,520
Shoot. Hide quickly

493
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,160
Get out of here

494
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,480
Han Qingkui, I'll kill you

495
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,760
Fuck off

496
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Shangshang

497
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,520
Hold her down

498
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Don't move. Go away

499
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,520
Let go of me

500
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,640
Move and kill you

501
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,360
Be honest and don't move

502
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,200
Don't move

503
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,240
Which little girl film is OK

504
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,120
The market has gone up, hasn't it

505
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,040
Now use a gun

506
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
How did Queye kill her

507
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,720
Don't don't don't

508
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Get it back

509
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,440
I'll ask where the gun came from

510
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,240
Go and take it back

511
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,080
Walk

512
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Let go of me

513
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
Hold her down

514
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,040
Hold her down

515
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,880
Are you two okay? Okay

516
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Jujube

517
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,880
You tried to kill me again and again

518
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,760
And sue me everywhere, don't you

519
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Do you know

520
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,840
Queye sees you as an orphan

521
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Pity you, you know

522
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,760
What about you

523
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,480
I can't believe you stole a gun to kill me

524
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,640
The surname Han

525
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
Don't talk so much nonsense

526
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,600
If you have the ability today, you will be killed by me

527
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,680
Sure

528
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Little girl film

529
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
You, Kui Ye, my whole life

530
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,680
Don't make a good-hearted mistake again

531
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,040
I shouldn't have left you as a scourge in the first place

532
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I should cut the grass and root out

533
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,160
Save you from harming me

534
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,480
I'll kill you

535
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,440
Queye

536
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,960
Please

537
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,800
Two treasures

538
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,040
Get this girl in the backyard

539
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,280
Buried

540
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,520
All right

541
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,160
Take the backyard and walk

542
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm not going

543
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Go

544
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,640
Let's go

545
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
Walk, walk

546
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,040
Go quickly

547
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,480
Go quickly

548
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,440
Go

549
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,160
Go

550
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,840
Go

551
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,520
Go

552
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,840
Go quickly

553
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,360
Team leader Zheng's presence is far from welcome

554
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,760
Sin, sin

555
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,240
Talk in the house

556
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes, please, please

557
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,520
Mr. Cheng

558
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,680
I don't know what's the order for visiting late at night

559
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,200
How's it going with what I told you

560
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,800
Mr. Zheng can rest assured

561
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,960
We're all following Mr. Zheng's orders

562
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,520
It's all ready

563
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,440
But

564
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,760
Do such a big thing

565
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,680
These brothers don't have enough guys

566
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,120
I have all the guns you want ready for you

567
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,920
That's great

568
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,560
Mr. Zheng has these hand-weighing guys

569
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,800
Ensure the completion of the task

570
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,640
I've already asked Peak for instructions

571
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,280
Once this operation is successful,

572
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,320
You and your brothers can withdraw from the city

573
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,080
Go to Xishan Zhongyi National Salvation Army to fight guerrilla warfare

574
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,680
And there are rewards

575
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,840
Thank you, Mr. Zheng, for your love

576
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
That's great

577
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,440
To tell you the truth, I know it too

578
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,000
Since the Communist Party entered the city,

579
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,120
There is definitely no way for me to live

580
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,640
Why don't you fight to the death with them

581
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,640
There is a way in the sky, you don't go

582
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,760
There is no way to hell. You come and vote

583
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Jujube, this is your own death

584
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
Don't blame you, Master Bao

585
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,680
Buried

586
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,040
No, it's bad. Something happened

587
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,800
There's a fight

588
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
It's bad. Something happened

589
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
Go, go, go, go, go

590
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,560
What to do

591
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,840
It's crazy

592
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,520
Release

593
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,000
Where did the wild boy come from

594
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,040
Dare to let me release people

595
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,600
Are you impatient to live

596
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,960
Believe it or not, I'll shoot you

597
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,120
Hit this way

598
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,600
Today, Kui Ye points his back

599
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,080
Catch up with that desperate thing, right

600
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,600
You want to die

601
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,400
I help you

602
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,320
Come on

603
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,440
Two treasures

604
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,280
Release

605
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,840
Queye

606
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,080
Release

607
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,200
Tow her away

608
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,759
Pull her up

609
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,840
Loosen

610
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
Why don't you bury it

611
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,719
Aren't you going to bury me alive

612
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,040
Cut the crap

613
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,120
Don't bury it

614
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,440
You're still getting excited, aren't you

615
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,239
I had to kill him

616
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,920
Take the front yard with you

617
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,759
Go

618
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,719
Quick, quick, quick

619
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,480
Come and bring it here

620
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,040
Quickly

621
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,239
Quick, quick, quick

622
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:24,840
Iron egg

623
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,120
Jujube

624
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:33,920
Two treasures

625
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,560
Queye

626
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
Don't even touch him

627
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
Kill his sister

628
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,720
Kill him

629
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Hit

630
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,320
Da Yong

631
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,960
The iron egg killed him

632
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,040
No

633
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,560
Dayong, you kill him. Go

634
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,600
Queye

635
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
Is Queye okay, Queye

636
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Are you all right, Queye

637
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
It's okay. Pull me up

638
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,320
Queye

639
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,240
Why don't you shoot him

640
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
I can't kill people

641
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,920
Then you put me down

642
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
You can't kill even if you put me down

643
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Iron egg

644
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,320
Don't worry about anything

645
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
You just listen to me

646
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Han Qingkui, he can't live

647
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,400
Tell me about these people

648
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
I can really do it

649
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,400
Are you in pain

650
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,680
Can I stop hurting? It's killing me

651
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,640
Sister, I just gave you a good medicine for this wound

652
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,440
You mustn't move tonight

653
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,640
I'll come back early tomorrow morning to change your dressing

654
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,640
Good

655
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm afraid this wound is infected with fever

656
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
Come on tonight

657
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,040
You can't leave people around this jujube

658
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,880
How about this, then

659
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
I'll stay here alone tonight

660
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,880
You all leave it alone

661
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,320
No need

662
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm here

663
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,600
Let me stay with her

664
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,720
That won't do, will it

665
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
You're a big man

666
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,560
That sister, in case anything is inconvenient at night

667
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Let me do it

668
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Really no need

669
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,720
If anything happens to Jujube

670
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,800
I'll call you again

671
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,600
That can't be done. Come on, Lanzi

672
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
Just let your iron egg guard here

673
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,160
Jujube

674
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,800
Jujube

675
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Uncle cooked you a bowl of wonton

676
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,240
Eat it while it is hot and put it there

677
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
Thank you, Uncle

678
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,960
Nothing

679
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
Or

680
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
Let her rest and eat something

681
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,360
Row

682
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,280
Your Uncle Boss

683
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,360
Aunt Li Xiulan coal core

684
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,440
You guys go back

685
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,480
It's getting late

686
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
Big guy, go to sleep quickly

687
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,760
Get it

688
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Have something to say hello to

689
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,600
Coal core, you have to sleep with Sister Xiulan tonight

690
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,200
Come back with me

691
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,240
Let's come to see my sister tomorrow

692
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,160
Go

693
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,800
If you need anything, call us quickly

694
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,440
It's just outside

695
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,480
OK, you can rest assured

696
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Come with me tonight

697
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,400
Come and have some wonton

698
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,080
I really can't eat. Why don't you put it there first

699
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,520
Row

700
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,440
Eat later

701
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Let me ask you something

702
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,400
Why did you go to Han's house

703
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Dayong told me

704
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,280
Then aren't you afraid

705
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,640
What are you afraid of

706
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,880
What are you afraid of when you're dying

707
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,880
It's a big deal to die with you

708
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,920
I didn't see the iron egg

709
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,240
You are really capable

710
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,280
So many people have been knocked down by you

711
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm just like you. I can't do it here

712
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Okay, iron egg

713
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Han Qingkui's gun is pointed at your forehead

714
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,200
Don't you dare go up there and beat him up

715
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Bullshit. He dares to hit my woman

716
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,520
Can I spare him

717
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,040
It's light to beat him up

718
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,880
Who is your woman

719
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,200
Think beautifully

720
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,640
But seriously

721
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
Iron Eggs Tonight

722
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,280
Is a man

723
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,080
Cheng

724
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,840
Have you this sentence

725
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,320
It's worth it tonight

726
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,760
You wait a minute

727
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,040
You slow down

728
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
It's not right

729
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,200
Why is it wrong

730
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,840
Han Qingkui has a gun

731
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,840
He let me go easily as soon as you went

732
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,800
You go up there and hit him

733
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,480
He told his men not to pull you up

734
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,600
What's wrong

735
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,040
You are his father. You are so polite to you

736
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Yeah

737
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
I don't know what's going on

738
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,400
Forget it, you can't think about it

739
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,120
You will take good care of your injury tonight

740
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,160
The PLA will enter the city early tomorrow morning

741
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,160
Queye

742
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,520
What's the matter with you today

743
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,760
Why are you afraid of him

744
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,560
What do you know

745
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,360
This man is not to be taunted

746
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
What's not to be taunted

747
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,600
Is he just a wreck

748
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,160
You shut up, you

749
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,360
Not Queye

750
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,880
I've been with you for so many years

751
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,840
I haven't seen you suffer this anger before

752
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,360
Today, your side is planted big

753
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,040
If you today

754
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,560
Don't find this side and make it up

755
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,040
In the future, you will be in 49 cities

756
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,520
You can't get along

757
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,200
What kind of fire are you arching

758
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200
The People's Liberation Army is about to hit the city

759
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,880
What kind of mess are you adding

760
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,760
If you can't bear it, you will make a big plan

761
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,400
Queye still has big things to do

762
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,960
Shut up, too

763
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,560
What else do I have to do

764
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,520
Erbao is right

765
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Why don't I get this back today

766
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,240
How can I mix in this 49 city in the future

767
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
How did I get out of this door, Han Qingkui

768
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,760
Is

769
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,720
Queye, what do you want to do

770
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:27,760
Queye, what do you want to do

771
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,800
Iron eggs are not to be taunted

772
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,120
You can't keep dates in this field

773
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,640
Didn't Mr. Zheng bring the gun

774
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,720
Who are we afraid of when we have a gun

775
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,880
Erbao will take the brothers for a while

776
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,360
Take a gun

777
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,760
They didn't react while Tian Zao

778
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,640
Do it all for them

779
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,600
Get it

780
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,960
Kui Ye, I will listen to your words

781
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,480
OK, I'll go

782
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,480
Queye, if you really do this

783
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,120
How can we account for Mr. Zheng

784
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,080
What am I telling you

785
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,400
Kill such a Tian Zao girl film

786
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,600
What's the big deal

787
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,040
Isn't it over if you don't kill iron eggs

788
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,960
Hurry up

789
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,800
Quick and quick

790
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Quick and quick

791
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,320
Wake up

792
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
Why are you up

793
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,000
How does it still hurt?

794
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
What's the rush

795
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,880
I have all these skin injuries

796
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
And I think

797
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,680
I feel as if I'm all right.

798
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,840
It's all right

799
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,080
Skin trauma is also a wound

800
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,840
You, let's lie down and rest honestly

801
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,760
That won't work

802
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,200
I have to go out today

803
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,920
You're hurt like this

804
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,120
You don't recuperate honestly

805
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,280
Why do you always go out

806
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,000
Today's army into the city is so lively

807
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,320
Is it appropriate for me not to go
