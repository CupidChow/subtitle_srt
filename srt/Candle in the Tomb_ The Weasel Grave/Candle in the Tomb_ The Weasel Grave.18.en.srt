1
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Come

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Water

3
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Old Hu

4
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,920
You still haven't told me

5
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,280
Why is that big gecko called "Shougong"?

6
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
Shougong

7
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,960
It means guarding the inner palace

8
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
In ancient times, the emperor

9
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,600
had three palaces and six courtyards

10
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
To prevent chaos in the harem

11
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
The eunuchs would select dark green geckos

12
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
and raise them in jars

13
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,360
When they were grown enough, they would be caught

14
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,200
dried, ground into powder, and used as medicine

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,760
applied to the arms of newly entered women

16
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,880
But what was the use of this?

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
The red dot on the woman's arm

18
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
was called "Shougong sand"

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,320
If a virgin lost her virginity

20
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,320
the Shougong sand would disappear

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
If the emperor discovered

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
that a concubine he hadn't slept with

23
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
no longer had the Shougong sand on her arm

24
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,240
it would be considered a crime of deceiving the emperor

25
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Xiao Ding

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,760
How are you feeling? Any better?

27
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
I feel much better.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
It's not hot anymore.

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Old Hu

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,960
You really have miraculous hands.

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,920
What did you give her? It's amazing.

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,120
What medicine did you give me?

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't worry about it.

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
No matter what was taken,

35
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,520
it's good that she's fine.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,120
Illness is 30% treatment and 70% care.

37
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,760
But we shouldn't stay here long.

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,440
We need to leave quickly.

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,800
Xiao Ding, can you manage?

40
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
I can do it.

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
Let's hurry up and go.

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,080
Alright, let's go.

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Help her up.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Want to leave

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,640
Turn the underworld upside down

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,920
Do you think the King of Hell will let you leave so easily

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
The coward finally showed up.

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
Old thief, what are you up to this time?

49
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
Are you hesitant or just soft-hearted?

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,520
Do you insist on keeping a few nuisances around?

51
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Eyebrow drawing

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Eyebrow drawing

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
At first, we thought digging for gold was just a cover.

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,640
They just wanted to use us to find the Ghost Gate.

55
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
To get the bronze box.

56
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,000
They say the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
You are the oriole hiding behind.

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,640
That's putting it lightly.

59
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,200
I am a hunter specialized in catching orioles.

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
Then you better be careful.

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Don't let the oriole peck out your eyes.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,680
If it weren't for the thrush stopping me,

63
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,280
you would have died eight times already.

64
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,560
We'll settle your account in the fall.

65
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,720
Take the bronze box and come with me.

66
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,160
Dad,

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,480
what exactly is in that box?

68
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,600
What exactly is in that box?

69
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,920
Take your things and come with Dad. Let's go.

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,880
Girl, you can't go.

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,760
If you take one more step, I'll kill you.

73
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,560
Come, I'll see you off.

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm telling you, girl, you're being used as a tool.

75
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
Why don't you believe what I'm saying?

76
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,040
He just wants to use you.

77
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,160
He's the one I told you about.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
The master of calculations from the Ni'er Society.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Sun Qiaoshan.

80
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,360
Girl, don't believe him.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
He's no good.

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
Back then in the Northeast,

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,880
his brother Yang Erdan became the head of the gang.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
He worked as his strategist.

85
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,520
They did a lot of grave robbing.

86
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,480
You have the nerve to talk.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
If you hadn't incited my brother,

88
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,120
to team up with the Japanese,

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
he wouldn't have died so miserably.

90
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,200
He went behind my back to dig up the temple with the Japanese.

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
He brought it on himself.

92
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
I knew it.

93
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
I searched the entire base.

94
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
I didn't see this bronze box.

95
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,800
Then I understood.

96
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,560
Yang Erdan realized the Japanese were going to betray him.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,080
He couldn't swallow his anger.

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
So he brought them here.

99
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,560
Made them use the wrong method.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,480
To open this box.

101
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,720
And got everyone buried with him.

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Right, Old Yangpi?

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
This box

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,280
was left by the founder

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,280
I have to take it back, it's called returning it to its rightful owner

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,400
You're talking nonsense

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,000
You just want to use the power of this box

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,280
to revive the Muddy Society

109
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,880
The skills of the Xieling warriors were left by the founder

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,880
They cannot be destroyed in my hands

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,760
This box contains treasures that can summon souls

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,280
As long as we find the place where the sea energy gathers

113
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
we can reunite the souls of the dead

114
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
and bring them back to life

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
Dad

116
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,360
Didn't you say you had a terminal illness?

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
Looking for the copper box

118
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,240
was to save your life?

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,440
What did I say?

120
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
He's full of lies

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
This box can't save anyone

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
It can only summon ghosts

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,039
He wants to awaken the thousands of ghost soldiers

124
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,640
Girl

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,560
I ask you

126
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
Were you born in the year of Dinghai

127
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
on the first day of the first lunar month at midnight

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
It seems I guessed right.

129
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,800
You are indeed the biological child of my brother Erdan.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,520
This scoundrel raised you

131
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,960
just to use your fate.

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,480
Because you are

133
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,880
The great Xianbei witch's

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
heir

135
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,240
Daughter

136
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
Listen to your father, come with me

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,040
Let's go, let's go

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
Dad doesn't have time to explain to you right now

139
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,120
You're not my dad at all

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,800
The sparrow eventually pecked out its eye.

141
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
If we don't leave now

142
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,240
I will

143
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
I'll beat you to death

144
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,680
You dare

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
Then you can't blame me.

146
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
Old Hu

147
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,640
Hu Bayi

148
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,120
Old Hu

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,720
Come

150
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Come

151
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,240
Come on

152
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Shoot

153
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
Shoot!

154
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Come on!

155
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Come!

156
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Come on, do it!

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,680
Wang Kaixuan

158
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,880
Huamei, get out of the way

159
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Wang Kaixuan

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,280
I need to save him

161
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,160
I want him to live

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
I am going to the place of eternal rest now

163
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Daughter

164
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
No one stop me

165
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,160
Hu Bayi

166
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,400
Old Hu, wake up

167
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
The revolution isn't over yet

168
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
How can you just leave like that

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Marx and Engels

170
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,880
also joined forces for the revolution

171
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Unlike you

172
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,840
You didn't leave a brother behind

173
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,240
Hu Bayi

174
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,000
I know you don't care about me

175
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,560
but I care about you

176
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,760
no matter what

177
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
in life, you belong to me, Yan Zi

178
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,120
in death, you are my ghost, Yan Zi

179
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
can you open your eyes and look at me

180
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,480
Hu Bayi, you can't die

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
Hu Bayi

182
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
wake up quickly

183
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Hu Bayi, did you hear me

184
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,560
Hu Bayi

185
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,440
You are so noisy.

186
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,000
You came back to life.

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,960
Hu Bayi

188
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,320
You're not dead

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Bless the ancestors

190
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,320
Get up

191
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch

192
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
Are you messing with me again?

193
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,480
Take it easy

194
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,840
Get up

195
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,960
Bless the Eternal Heaven, bless the Eternal Heaven

196
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,040
Get up

197
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,160
Bless the Eternal Heaven

198
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,520
Where is Huamei?

199
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,520
Huamei was taken by Uncle Qiaoshan for a summoning ritual.

200
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Summoning ritual

201
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,440
To save you

202
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,480
Save me?

203
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,360
No

204
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,480
We can't let them go

205
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,640
If we're late, it will be too late. Let's go.

206
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Let's go.

207
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
Huamei

208
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
Is that you?

209
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
Huamei

210
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Come back

211
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
What are you staring at?

212
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,440
Let's go.

213
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,720
Hurry up.

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Oh my gosh

215
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,240
This place looks like the gates of hell

216
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,760
It's not just like

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,600
This is the gates of hell

218
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,080
Look at this big iron gate

219
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,600
It separates the living from the dead

220
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,200
We

221
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
are standing right here

222
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,400
on the boundary between life and death

223
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Don't scare her

224
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
Stay alert later

225
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
In case we encounter danger

226
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
We'll switch the rear to the front

227
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,079
Okay

228
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,359
Xiao Ding

229
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,200
Xiao Ding

230
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,319
How are you feeling now?

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
I feel a bit of tightness in my chest.

232
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
I coughed up some clotted blood.

233
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,720
I feel much better now.

234
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,320
I think this way

235
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
Grandpa Yang, Swallow

236
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,800
you stay here with Xiao Ding

237
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,360
I'll go with Fatty to check out this Yama Hall

238
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,920
to see which ghost or god is behind this

239
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,880
No way

240
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
If you go, I have to go too

241
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,880
I need to go save the girl Huamei

242
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,480
Then I'll go too

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
Can you handle it?

244
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,360
Alright

245
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,720
Fatty

246
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,280
Let's go

247
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Come

248
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,200
Come

249
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,200
Fatty

250
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,040
Be careful

251
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh my gosh

252
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,760
What is this place

253
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Why are there so many turtle shells here?

254
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,000
If I'm not mistaken

255
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,560
this is the resting place of the turtles.

256
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,800
Yes

257
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
This is the true resting place of the turtles.

258
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
When the old sea turtles are about to die

259
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,880
they crawl onto land to bury their bones.

260
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
The people buried here

261
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,120
must have wanted to use the spiritual energy of the turtle resting place

262
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
to ascend to immortality.

263
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
It seems they found the right place.

264
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,960
What are those lights?

265
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
I once read in a book

266
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,680
that there are some legends in coastal areas

267
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
about ancient turtles that have lived in the sea for thousands of years

268
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,440
and their bodies must contain a lot of sea energy

269
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,320
so the place where the turtles hide their bones

270
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,360
must have sea energy transforming

271
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,120
The lights we see

272
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,560
should be the sea energy stored here

273
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
Old Hu

274
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,920
Why are there so many bodies here?

275
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
This is the eighteenth level of hell.

276
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
There's only this one path.

277
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,000
Are we still going forward?

278
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
Oh my god.

279
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,800
What the hell

280
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,120
That's all feudal superstition, it's one of the Four Olds

281
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Nothing to fear

282
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's go

283
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,560
Why do these corpses all look like Soviets?

284
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,480
They're all covered in hair.

285
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,360
It's probably due to the soil composition here.

286
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,160
Causing the corpses to undergo a similar state to metamorphosis.

287
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,480
Be careful.

288
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
Metamorphosis doesn't mean they can ascend to heaven.

289
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
It's useless.

290
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm afraid

291
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,000
it was the ancient people's fear of the concept of life and death

292
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
that made them unable to accept the reality of living only once

293
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,640
hoping that after death

294
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,040
life could continue

295
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
so they created legends like the underworld

296
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,720
If people really have spirits after death

297
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,520
seeing themselves after death

298
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,400
their bodies being desecrated like this

299
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,480
I wonder what they would think

300
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
This way, quickly

301
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,840
Look

302
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
Is that a thrush?

303
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,040
Go over and take a look.

304
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Xiao Ding

305
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,240
Old Hu

306
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,080
Hu Bayi

307
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,800
Good boy, you have a tough life.

308
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,520
I can't believe this shot didn't kill you.

309
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
The King of Hell won't take me.

310
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
He sent me to take you down.

311
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,960
Brat

312
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,400
I want to see how many lives you have.

313
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,400
Come on, come on.

314
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,640
Come on, whoever comes dies.

315
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,720
You are the enemy of the people.

316
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,280
Put down the gun, let's talk.

317
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,280
Maybe we can turn from enemies to comrades.

318
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,600
Alright.

319
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,200
Okay.

320
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
You guys go back first.

321
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,840
I'll talk to you after I handle this.

322
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,160
Have a good talk.

323
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,640
Huamei

324
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,440
I am Hu Bayi

325
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm fine

326
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,320
Don't let Qiaoshan use you as a tool anymore

327
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,400
Daughter, come down quickly

328
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Huamei, we are here to save you

329
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,160
Xiao Ding

330
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,360
Now

331
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,680
It's too late to say anything

332
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,760
Are you okay?

333
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
Chandlerpan, are you crazy?

334
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,040
There's no time

335
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,880
I'll see you off

336
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,080
We mustn't let her open that box

337
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,000
Old Hu, we have two guns

338
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
Suppressive fire

339
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Attack

340
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,680
We must uphold our army's fine tradition of offensive warfare

341
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,280
Attack them by surprise, flank them from both sides

342
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
I'll distract him

343
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,120
You quickly save Huamei

344
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,800
Okay

345
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,640
Uncle Yang, Xiao Ding is in your hands

346
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
Hold on tight

347
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,760
Go

348
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,040
You two be careful

349
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,560
Qiaoshan, your shooting skills are not good.

350
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,720
jerk

351
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,640
I dare you

352
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,200
to come

353
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Eyebrow painting

354
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,160
Eyebrow painting

355
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,240
That box must never be opened

356
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,640
Think about Swallow

357
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,840
Think about Little Ding

358
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,440
Think about Fatty and Old Master Yang

359
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Think about me

360
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
As soon as that box is opened

361
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
All the ghost soldiers will be resurrected

362
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
By then, we will all
