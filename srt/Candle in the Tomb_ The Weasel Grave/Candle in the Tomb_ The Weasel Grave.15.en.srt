1
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
Old Hu

2
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,760
There's a piece of clothing here

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
You put it on

4
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,160
There's also a map here

5
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
Take a look

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Oh my gosh

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,200
This is like a treasure chest, it has everything

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,040
This box is pretty good

9
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,640
Got it, buddy

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,840
Fatty

11
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,440
Be careful with that box

12
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,680
Don't hurt yourself before you hit someone

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,720
Can't you wish me well for once

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,560
Swallow

15
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,600
Aren't you hungry?

16
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,040
Canned food

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
It's been sitting for so long, it's definitely spoiled.

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm not eating it.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
Eat it if you want.

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
The Soviets want to escape.

21
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
They must have prepared a lot of things.

22
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,800
Xiao Ding

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Have you finished translating the Soviet's diary?

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Almost.

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,560
There are quite a few parts I don't understand.

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
It's okay.

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
If you eat in a hurry, you might burn your mouth.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
If you walk in a hurry, you might trip.

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
We're not in a hurry to leave, let's take a break first.

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Tell everyone what it says.

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,400
Okay

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
Then I'll start with the ones I can understand

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
It was probably written like this

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,760
The Soviet who wrote the diary was a descendant of the Tsar

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,240
His name was Karev

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Exiled in Germany

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,800
He made unique contributions in the field of medicine

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
And he was also a bacteriology expert

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,360
He was under house arrest by the Germans for many years

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
Later, he was

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
seconded to Unit 731 by the Nazis

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,360
to the Bozi Research Institute under its jurisdiction

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Forced to conduct military research near Baiyan Cave

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,160
conduct military research

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
The diary said

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,120
A squadron of the Japanese Kwantung Army

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,760
mysteriously disappeared in the area near Mobei in Hulunbuir

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,040
mysteriously disappeared

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
The reconnaissance unit near Baiyan Cave

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,280
discovered some mysterious supernatural phenomena

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
The Japanese sent a water unit

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,240
to excavate a huge underground cave

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
At the bottom of the cave, there were many well-preserved ancient corpses

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
At the highest point

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
there was a strange female corpse wearing a mask

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,400
After investigation and comparison with ancient texts

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,240
an astonishing conclusion was reached

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,840
This was the legendary

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,839
Han Dynasty Great Xianbei Shamaness

60
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,920
In ancient times, she was a semi-mythical figure

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,000
Her burial site was filled with dragon energy

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Is there more?

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Keep reading.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
Later,

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,800
the Japanese built

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
an underground secret research facility near the burial ground.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,640
They also bred golden-scaled pythons

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,520
and some rare plants and animals.

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,880
They used the dragon energy from the burial ground for biochemical experiments.

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,680
The smoke released by the golden-scaled pythons is highly toxic.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Anyone who inhales it will develop a fever.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,080
If an antidote is not found

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
within a day,

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,880
they will

75
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,320
What if we can't find it?

76
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,960
I can't understand this part.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
After the research institute was built

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
As the excavation deepened

79
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
Ghosts suddenly appeared near the Hundred Eyes Cave

80
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,280
At night, ghostly lights flickered everywhere

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,000
Fog began to appear during the day

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,640
The Japanese were panicked

83
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,360
They thought they had released the vengeful spirits from the corpse cave

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,240
So they found a local onmyoji

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Following his method

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,480
They built a

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,000
semi-underground crematorium inside the building

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,040
All rooms and windows were sealed

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,760
Then they took the numerous ancient corpses excavated from the corpse cave

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
and burned them in the crematorium

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
They thought this would intimidate the spirits

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
But later

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
some bandits from the northeast

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,120
brought a newly unearthed bronze box

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,600
That night

96
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,360
the entire research institute was filled with alarm sounds

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,640
That's it.

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
That's it.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,080
This is all I can understand.

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
Sealing the door like this

101
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
matches the crematorium incident.

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Based on the timeline,

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,440
it should be before the Soviet army attacked the Kwantung Army.

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,960
So this research institute

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,640
was not yet destroyed by the Kwantung Army.

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,680
Pretty much.

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,200
He didn't say what was in that copper box.

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I don't know.

109
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,360
He suddenly stopped writing.

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,240
I can't understand a word you kids are saying.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,520
This alcohol has a strong kick.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,840
I'm going to lie down for a bit.

113
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
What's up?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
We've been busy all night.

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
Let's take a break.

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm exhausted.

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's leave it like this for now.

118
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
You guys rest for a while.

119
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll keep watch.

120
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
Old Hu

121
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
What's going on here?

122
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I don't know either.

123
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,400
I saw it like this as soon as I opened my eyes.

124
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh my gosh

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,560
It's haunted

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
Why is this thing back again

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,680
Didn't see any ghost

128
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Pretending to be a ghost

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,760
There is one

130
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,440
What do you mean

131
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Ask him

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
Eyebrow

133
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,720
What are you doing? Put the gun down!

134
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
Daughter

135
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
Stop trying to get close to me.

136
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Who is your daughter?

137
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,160
I felt something was wrong as soon as I entered the mountain.

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,240
As soon as we came in,

139
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
someone pulled the gate.

140
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
Cutting off our retreat.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Later,

142
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,040
they opened the crematorium door.

143
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Releasing the giant snake.

144
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,600
I stay up at night

145
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
to catch this ghost.

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,120
Sure enough,

147
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,160
while everyone was sleeping,

148
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,520
someone quietly brought this back.

149
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Tell me, why?

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
Was it really you?

151
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, yes, it's me.

152
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
So it really was you.

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,080
Wang Kaixuan

154
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,760
You brought it back.

155
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,160
Let go.

156
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,680
Why exactly?

157
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,080
Fatty

158
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,480
Let go.

159
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,040
Why exactly?

160
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
Fatty, let go.

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
Let go, let go.

162
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,640
Old Hu

163
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Hold on, don't explode yet

164
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,640
Let Mr. Yang finish speaking

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
I did this

166
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
with no intention of harming anyone

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,600
Along the way,

168
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,280
I always felt like something

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
was watching us from behind.

170
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,760
I kept feeling a chill in my heart.

171
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,560
At night, I kept thinking it over and over.

172
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,960
It didn't feel right.

173
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,960
If we don't bring back these bones,

174
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,640
and that thing discovers our whereabouts,

175
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,360
won't we be in big trouble?

176
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
You said something is following us

177
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
What is it

178
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,920
I can't say what it is

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,560
That's why I didn't tell everyone

180
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,160
Did something shameful

181
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,600
Now you can't explain it clearly and still think you're right

182
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,520
Swear to the eternal sky

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,120
If I tell a single lie, may I die a terrible death

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
I believe in Old Master Yang

185
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,200
Old Master Yang doesn't look like a bad person

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,680
There must be some misunderstanding

187
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
What can a silly girl understand

188
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,400
Who are you calling silly

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Yan Zi

190
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
You suspect this and that every day

191
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,960
I think the most suspicious person is you

192
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,080
Yan Zi, enough

193
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,800
I remember now

194
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,520
You two went to find the way earlier

195
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,960
I saw her alone on the stairs

196
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,600
Sneaking around, don't know what she was doing

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
Sister

198
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,600
You better explain it to me clearly

199
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
Something a silly girl said

200
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
And you believe it

201
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,560
Say it again

202
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,680
What's wrong with you

203
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
And

204
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,120
Speak clearly, what did you see?

205
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,720
I

206
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
Think it through before you speak.

207
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,240
Swallow

208
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,960
We can't let a bad person go

209
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,680
Nor can we wrong a good person

210
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,760
Think it through

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
It's too dark

212
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,080
I really couldn't see clearly

213
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
Come here

214
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,360
You're full of nonsense

215
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
Aren't you afraid of biting your own tongue?

216
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,760
You were the one leading the way all along

217
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
You brought us to the Hundred Eyes Cave

218
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,240
What are you up to?

219
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
I brought you to the Hundred Eyes Cave

220
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,960
I made it very clear before I came

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
I came to find my father

222
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
It has nothing to do with you

223
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
You were the ones who wanted to follow

224
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,200
I didn't come with you

225
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
I came with Commander Hu

226
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,880
But you and your father

227
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,760
Didn't stay in the good Northeast

228
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,600
Came all the way to Inner Mongolia

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,120
Who knows what you came here for

230
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,320
We go wherever we want.

231
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
It's none of your business.

232
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,440
You and your father come.

233
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,200
I roughly know the reason.

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,880
Listen to my advice.

235
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,760
It's never too late to turn back.

236
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,080
That thing

237
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,640
That thing is not a joke.

238
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,920
It could cost lives if not handled properly.

239
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,600
Do you really think I know nothing?

240
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
That's life-saving.

241
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
Life-saving

242
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
You should think about it.

243
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Can a life-saving thing be placed among the dead?

244
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,320
You've all seen it along the way.

245
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,520
We haven't gone far.

246
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
We're already at death's door.

247
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,080
We've been going in circles.

248
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
If we don't go back now,

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the King of Hell

250
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,320
will really send his minions to take us.

251
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,840
Yes

252
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,560
Old Yang is right.

253
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,640
If we don't go back now, we really won't be able to.

254
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,760
I'll go back with Old Yang.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120
If you want to go back, you go back.

256
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,920
We're not on the same path anyway.

257
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,760
Alright

258
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,480
I'll be honest

259
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,320
I did see it too

260
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,680
Along the way

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
Something has been following us.

262
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,640
We should argue with words, not with fists.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
We should focus on external issues, not internal conflicts.

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Everyone must stay united.

265
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
If we are not united,

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,440
how can we sweep away all the evil spirits?

267
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Is everyone clear?

268
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,760
No objections

269
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
If there are no objections, I'll take it as everyone agrees

270
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
If anyone causes trouble again

271
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,360
I won't be polite to them

272
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,480
What's wrong?

273
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Xiao Ding

274
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,600
Xiao Ding

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,360
Help her up

276
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,080
Xiao Ding

277
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
What's wrong with you?

278
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
What's wrong, girl?

279
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,000
Your eyes

280
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
My eyes

281
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,400
What's wrong

282
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
Why are your eyes bleeding

283
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
What kind of curse is this

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Bloodshot eyes

285
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm afraid

286
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,760
it's the venom of the golden-scaled python

287
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,880
The words in the diary just now

288
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
I understood them

289
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
I was afraid you would worry

290
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,240
so I didn't tell you

291
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,720
There is no antidote

292
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
Next

293
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,920
are the internal organs

294
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,280
Antidote

295
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Xiao Ding

296
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,640
Lao Hu, where is the antidote?

297
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,920
The brocade-scaled python is kept by the Japanese military doctor.

298
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,400
Research building

299
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,320
The research building must have the antitoxin serum.

300
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Let's go up and find it.

301
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay, okay.

302
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,280
Okay.

303
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,120
Go, go to the research building, go to the research building.

304
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,880
Hold on.

305
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,240
How do we get there?

306
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Research building.

307
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,640
The exit is here.

308
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,280
There must be an exit nearby.

309
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
We have to backtrack a bit.

310
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,560
Okay.

311
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,800
No, don't backtrack.

312
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,320
It wastes everyone's time.

313
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
What time are we wasting, Xiao Ding?

314
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,080
Listen to me.

315
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,720
Nothing is wrong, understand?

316
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
We came together.

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,880
We have to go back together.

318
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll lead the team.

319
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,440
Come.

320
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,440
Let's go.

321
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,160
Come.

322
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,880
Let's go.

323
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,160
Old Hu

324
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,840
What they just said

325
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
Did you understand?

326
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Some I understood, some I didn't

327
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,200
Why are you playing dumb with me?

328
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
They came all the way here

329
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,120
I can't figure out their intentions

330
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,320
But the show has started, so let's keep looking

331
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,800
Let's stay alert and adapt to the situation

332
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
The most important thing right now

333
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,320
is to help Xiao Ding find the medicine

334
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Old Hu

335
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,080
This box has a Red Cross symbol on it.

336
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,520
Could it be filled with medicine inside?

337
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,240
This box is cleaner than a bald head.

338
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,720
Where did the medicine come from?

339
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,680
Don't listen to her nonsense.

340
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,400
This isn't for storing medicine at all.

341
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,120
Then what is it for?

342
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
Look at this

343
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
Reticulated python

344
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,240
Origin: Luzon Island, Philippines

345
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,520
And this

346
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,720
Spotted centipede

347
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Origin

348
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,360
Myitkyina, Myanmar

349
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
There's also a Malaysian rat

350
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,400
All foreign animals

351
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
Are they planning to build a zoo here?

352
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
These animals are probably sent here for experiments

353
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,440
The so-called water supply unit

354
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
is actually a bacteriological research institute

355
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,000
Not even sparing the rats

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Truly rotten to the core

357
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,720
How can this person be so brainless?

358
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
After all this fuss

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,760
This is a complete massacre scene

360
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,120
You came here just to find these things?

361
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
Yes, yes, yes

362
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,000
Find the medicine

363
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Find the medicine

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,840
Fatty, don't move

365
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't move

366
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,080
What's wrong

367
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Bow your head

368
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,240
Where did this yellow weasel come from?

369
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
And it's got white fur.

370
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,480
The white ones are the dangerous ones.

371
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,320
Whose life is it after?

372
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
It's after whoever it has a grudge against.

373
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Chandlerpan

374
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,520
The yellow weasel we caught

375
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,800
What happened to it?

376
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,040
We handed it over to the supply and marketing cooperative.

377
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,280
There are very few yellow weasels on the grasslands.

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,640
The yellow weasels from Inner Mongolia

379
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,720
don't have this fur color.

380
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,320
I heard from the blind old lady

381
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,680
that yellow weasels grow a strand of white fur every thirty years.

382
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,960
Have these two lived too long?

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,240
They've become spirits.

384
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
Look at this posture

385
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,120
Doesn't it look familiar?

386
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
Just like those white claws at the door before

387
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Exactly the same

388
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,000
Old Hu

389
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
Today I must

390
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,360
Where did it go?

391
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
The wooden box, the wooden box.

392
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,600
To the left, quietly.

393
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
Here we go again.

394
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,520
Wherever we go, these two follow.

395
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,720
We must get rid of this menace.

396
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,680
Chandlerpan, you take Xiao Ding and go first.

397
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
I'll deal with these two and then come find you.

398
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,560
Stop trying to show off.

399
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,680
We leave together.

400
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
That's an order.

401
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,000
Xiao Ding is poisoned right now.

402
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,440
Yan Zi, Hua Mei, Yang Da Ye, you go first.

403
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,440
Retreat.

404
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,440
Be careful!

405
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,120
Go, go, go!

406
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,560
Yan Zi, go!

407
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,200
Xiao Ding, hurry!

408
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,600
Go!

409
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,520
What's wrong? Let's go.

410
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,560
You need a helper.

411
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
Once the scar heals, you forget the pain.

412
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,640
You've been cursed by the yellow weasel.

413
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,520
I won't fall into the same trap twice.

414
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,320
You're quite brave.

415
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
Not as brave as you.

416
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,320
Your shooting skills are really terrible.

417
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,440
Killing isn't a real skill.

418
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,640
We need to capture him alive, buddy.

419
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,160
Run!

420
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Run

421
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,560
Huamei, run quickly!

422
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,440
Run, Huamei!

423
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Hu Bayi!

424
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,600
Hu Bayi!

425
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Run, hurry!

426
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040
Eyebrow

427
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,160
Are you okay?

428
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Come

429
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
Don't move

430
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,680
Come, come, lie down.

431
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,840
Got it

432
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,960
Open the bag

433
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,480
Come

434
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,640
Cover it

435
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,040
Even the slyest fox can't escape the hunter

436
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
On behalf of the people, I sentence you both to life imprisonment

437
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,840
Come

438
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,880
What's in here?

439
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,920
It shouldn't be.

440
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
Is it this one?

441
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Here it is.

442
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,960
Be careful.

443
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,120
Let me tell you all,

444
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,440
this might just be

445
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,160
the main switch for the enemy's underground construction.

446
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,080
If you turn this on,

447
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,640
all the lights will come on.

448
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,800
Don't mess with it.

449
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
Wasn't it last time

450
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,840
Wang Kaixuan, what's wrong with you?

451
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,960
Don't come over, don't.

452
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,880
Swallow

453
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,600
Swallow

454
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,560
Swallow

455
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
Doll

456
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,640
Old Man Yang

457
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
What's wrong?

458
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,480
Thanks to Yanzi

459
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Otherwise, you would have been dead by now

460
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,280
Swallow

461
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,680
Swallow

462
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,720
Swallow, wake up

463
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't scare me

464
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,520
No breath

465
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,600
What should we do?

466
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
What to do?

467
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,640
Then what to do?

468
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,360
Swallow

469
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,280
Swallow

470
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,480
Someone, artificial respiration

471
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Quick

472
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,200
Yes, artificial respiration

473
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,920
Breathe, breathe

474
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,080
Breathe, quick, quick

475
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,720
Hurry up

476
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,840
Quickly

477
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,040
You

478
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,360
I just saved you

479
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
How can you repay kindness with enmity?

480
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
Taking advantage of me, hitting you is already lenient

481
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,160
Who took advantage of you?

482
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,640
I clearly don't know how to perform CPR

483
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Wasn't this to save you?

484
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,960
Besides

485
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
When we were in the northeast

486
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,240
You got into my bed, I haven't even settled that with you

487
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,560
If you keep babbling, I'll tear that filthy mouth of yours

488
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,800
It's this filthy mouth

489
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
That just saved your little life

490
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,280
Even if I get electrocuted

491
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,640
I don't want to be disgusted to death by you

492
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, come on

493
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,960
Alright, alright, alright

494
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,200
You two

495
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,120
Just saved each other

496
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,920
Why are you arguing now?

497
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,400
I saved you, what are you up to?

498
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,320
Who saved whom? I saved you

499
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,440
I saved you

500
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,560
Who saved whom? Who saved whom?

501
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,520
I saved you

502
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,160
What's wrong with you two? What are you arguing about?

503
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,840
Old Hu

504
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,600
Oh my

505
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,040
How did you get hurt?

506
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,040
It's nothing.

507
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,280
The makeup effect is used to confuse the enemy.

508
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,920
What's wrong with your face?

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
It's okay.

510
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,200
How did the battle turn out?

511
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,280
There's good news.

512
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,440
Swallow

513
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,440
Come here.

514
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,880
Swallow

515
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Come.

516
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,480
One

517
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,040
The python is dead.

518
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,520
How did it die?

519
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,400
It was killed by a thunderbolt from a buddy.

520
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
Two

521
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,240
We really caught it.

522
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,880
How did it die?

523
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
It's not dead, just passed out.

524
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Its belly is still moving.

525
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,640
Come.

526
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
Put it in the wonton wrapper.

527
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,520
Place it properly.

528
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,720
Fatty

529
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
I think these two

530
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,120
are here to avenge that female yellow weasel

531
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,560
Don't fool me

532
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,800
Could it be that these two yellow weasels

533
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,120
followed us all the way from the northeast

534
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,160
Along the way

535
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,800
I did feel something was following us

536
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,640
I also saw two shadows

537
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,560
I thought I was seeing things

538
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,480
As the old saying goes

539
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
Fox, willow, yellow, white, and gray

540
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,760
the most troublesome

541
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,520
is the yellow weasel

542
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,520
Even if you run to the ends of the earth, it can find you

543
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,160
So you say

544
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,640
the stampede

545
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
was it caused by them

546
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,720
Darn it

547
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,400
I knew it

548
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,680
How did the rope tying the fence break so easily

549
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,000
If that's the case

550
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,040
the iron gate yesterday

551
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,680
was probably also their doing

552
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,080
And the crematorium door

553
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,680
was probably also done by these two

554
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
They released the giant snake

555
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,080
almost got us killed

556
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,240
If it weren't for these two yellow weasels

557
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,680
Little Ding wouldn't have been poisoned

558
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
Xiao Ding

559
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,800
How are you feeling now?

560
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,840
I'm fine, don't worry.

561
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,440
The road may be winding, but the future is bright.

562
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,760
As long as we quickly find the antidote,

563
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,480
all problems will be easily solved.

564
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,360
I've studied the map.

565
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,640
The main building of the Japanese research institute is just ahead.

566
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,680
Let's stop chatting and get moving.

567
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Yan Zi, support Xiao Ding.

568
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,200
Fatty, let's go.
