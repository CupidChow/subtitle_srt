1
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Hurry up

2
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,360
Fatty

3
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,720
There's a ditch ahead, jump down quickly.

4
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,160
Hurry up!

5
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,600
Old Hu

6
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,120
Fatty, hurry

7
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
What about the horse?

8
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Forget it

9
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,080
Xiao Ding

10
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,480
Hold on tight

11
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Get down

12
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Old Master Yang

13
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
Hu Bayi

14
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,399
Hold on tight

15
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Girl

16
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
What should we do?

17
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,560
Hu Bayi

18
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Hu Bayi

19
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
Help!

20
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
Old Man Yang

21
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Hold on tight

22
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,400
Daughter

23
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,360
Eyebrow

24
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,960
Eyebrow

25
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Old Man Yang

26
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
Hold tight

27
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Hu Bayi

28
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,280
Hu Bayi

29
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Hold my hand tightly

30
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,760
Xiao Ding

31
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,520
Xiao Ding

32
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
Hu Bayi

33
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,640
Hold on tight

34
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Hu Bayi

35
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Xiao Ding

36
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't let go

37
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,960
Xiao Ding

38
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
Hold on tight

39
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Old Master Yang

40
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,760
Hold on tight, Master

41
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
Hold on tight

42
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,600
Hu Bayi

43
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Hold on

44
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,520
Hu Bayi

45
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
Don't let go

46
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,760
Xiao Ding

47
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
Don't let go

48
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Xiao Ding

49
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,160
Old Hu

50
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
Old Hu, Little Ding

51
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Girl, are you hurt?

52
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,320
Fatty

53
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
Fatty, give me a hand

54
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,560
Hurry

55
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Be careful

56
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,440
Come

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you

58
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,120
Fat jerk

59
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,040
Are you okay?

60
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,280
Yan Zi, Mr. Yang, are you okay?

61
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm fine

62
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm fine

63
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
Go that way

64
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Let's go

65
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
Mr. Yang

66
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Go

67
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,440
Slow down

68
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Okay

69
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Old Master Yang

70
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
That gust of wind just now

71
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
What was that about

72
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
Yeah

73
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,080
That wind was really strange

74
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
It could devour a horse

75
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
I told you

76
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,880
That wasn't wind

77
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,920
That was a demon dragon

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
You all saw it

79
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
The demon dragon is pitch black and eats everything it sees

80
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,960
It's over now

81
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,640
All my horses are gone

82
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,640
I've committed a great sin

83
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,280
Old Master, there's no use in worrying

84
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
Let's think of another way

85
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,640
There are many terrifying natural phenomena in this world

86
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,920
We can't possibly understand all the secrets

87
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
But it does indeed exist

88
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,120
Understood

89
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Xiao Ding

90
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,799
You mean

91
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Whether we use materialism or idealism

92
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
Those beasts,

93
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
I guess we can't get them back.

94
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,760
What goes around comes around.

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,520
Maybe the herd of horses

96
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
ran back on their own.

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
That's true.

98
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,040
Let's think positively.

99
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,720
Maybe the horses have already returned.

100
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,080
Even if the horses can return on their own,

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
can we go back?

102
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Hey girl,

103
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,840
Where do you want to go back to?

104
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,600
Where I go back to

105
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
Does it concern you?

106
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Maybe not

107
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
Maybe it does

108
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm asking you

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,720
Do you have any relatives left in the northeast?

110
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
Hu Bayi

111
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Our horse

112
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
was just taken by that demon dragon

113
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
The previous horse

114
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
must have also been taken by this demon dragon

115
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
Sister

116
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Just say it

117
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,840
My father said

118
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
this demon dragon comes from the Hundred-Eyed Cave

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,040
Are all our horses over there?

120
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,640
Old Master Yang

121
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
Where is the Hundred Eyes Cave?

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you know?

123
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,560
I don't know, I don't know.

124
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,400
Didn't you just say you saw the demon dragon?

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
How come you don't know now?

126
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes, I have seen the demon dragon.

127
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,400
But I haven't seen the Hundred Eyes Cave.

128
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I don't know.

129
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,160
Ignore him.

130
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
This Hundred Eyes Cave

131
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
is a legendary feng shui treasure land.

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,760
Aren't you skilled in feng shui?

133
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,880
It will come in handy.

134
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
I can do feng shui.

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
I can also locate the spot.

136
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Sure.

137
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
It's easy.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
I'll listen to you.

139
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
Difficult.

140
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,520
What do you mean?

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,360
I should be the one saying that.

142
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
What do you mean?

143
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,080
Do you think

144
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,520
that without you

145
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
I can't find the Hundred Eyes Cave?

146
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
The sixteen-character Yin-Yang Feng Shui secret technique says

147
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,120
Dragon

148
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Cave

149
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,280
Sand

150
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,360
Water

151
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,360
Direction

152
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,400
Its essence must be Qi

153
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,440
Seek the dragon

154
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,520
Find the cave

155
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,680
Observe the sand

156
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,680
Search for water

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Determine the direction

158
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,640
Its purpose is to find auspicious Qi and avoid harmful Qi

159
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,640
Only then can you find the true Feng Shui treasure land

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
The house faces the saddle with heavy water

161
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
The yin cave faces the peak with heavy mountains

162
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
The green dragon should be tight, not pressed

163
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,080
The table mountain should be close to the bright hall

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
The mountain sending the dragon is short at the back

165
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
The supporting mountain does not embrace with both hands

166
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,640
The coiling dragon coils past the front of the tiger and dragon

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,520
Three layers, five layers, blessings extend continuously

168
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
Hu Bayi

169
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,960
What are you mumbling about

170
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,440
You don't understand, do you, Xiao Ding

171
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,560
This new compass requires a formula

172
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,160
And this formula

173
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
Only Old Hu knows

174
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
Northeast direction

175
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Swallow has left

176
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,040
My God

177
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
You guys are crazy

178
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
You want to find it quickly

179
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,560
You have to follow me

180
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,280
Are you really going to find the demon dragon?

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,440
You should go back.

182
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,880
I won't see you off.

183
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,920
Wait for me, old man

184
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
Hu Bayi

185
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,520
What is tomb raiding?

186
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,880
What is a big zongzi?

187
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
It's something to eat.

188
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,320
Tomb raiding is grave robbing.

189
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,840
Zongzi are the corpses in the tombs.

190
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
According to my grandfather,

191
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,640
there are 360 professions in the world.

192
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,800
Every profession has its master.

193
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,280
But among them,

194
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,640
there are 72 traditional Chinese professions that form their own systems.

195
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
There are 72 in total.

196
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Each has its own heritage, origin, and founder.

197
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,000
So, what exactly is in the ancient tombs?

198
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,240
You want to know what's in the tomb chamber?

199
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,640
It would scare you to death if I told you.

200
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,760
What is it?

201
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
I don't know either.

202
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,440
But if you really want to know,

203
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
we have to ask Huamei.

204
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,600
Huamei

205
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
Do you also understand ancient tombs?

206
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,720
I don't know.

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
You don't know,

208
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,200
but your father

209
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,200
seems to be an expert.

210
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,200
My father guards the forest.

211
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Unlike you,

212
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
who can't even keep your mouth shut.

213
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,960
What do you mean?

214
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
What do you mean?

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
I mean exactly what I said.

216
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Girl

217
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,440
Let me ask

218
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,280
Your mother died early

219
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,320
Did your father raise you alone?

220
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,080
You care about me

221
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
You look kind

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,680
I want to ask a few more questions

223
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
Don't think that just because you saved me

224
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,160
I will be grateful to you

225
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,040
At worst

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll give my life back to you

227
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,000
And also

228
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
I am a bad person

229
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,880
Stay away from me

230
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
Girl

231
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,640
Don't worry, your dad will be fine

232
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,800
There will definitely be sacrifices on this revolutionary road

233
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Fatty

234
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
Can you speak properly

235
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,080
Missing doesn't mean sacrificed

236
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
Let's search carefully again

237
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

238
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,680
He won't die

239
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,320
He has great fortune and a long life

240
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,920
He has great fortune and a long life

241
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,320
I don't want anything

242
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,160
As long as he is alive

243
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,920
Yes

244
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,760
Bite your tongue to feel the pain

245
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,280
More important than anything

246
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,560
Hu Bayi

247
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,720
Are we on the right path

248
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,360
The position indicated by this compass must be correct.

249
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,800
The body of this mountain has stones as its bones.

250
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,680
The forest is its clothing, and the grass is its hair.

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,840
Water is its blood.

252
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,720
Clouds and mist are its spirit, and the haze is its complexion.

253
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,320
As long as we understand the pulse of these mountains and rivers,

254
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,440
we can find a way out of this desperate situation.

255
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,359
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

256
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,119
Xiao Ding,

257
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,440
look at those mountains.

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,119
Don't they look like a few big burial mounds?

259
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,920
Maybe inside,

260
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,599
there are many big coffins.

261
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,280
Oh my gosh, please no more big coffins.

262
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,359
Stop talking nonsense, let's go.

263
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,680
Sir, sir

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,440
Sir Yang, Sir Yang, Sir Yang

265
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Help the sir up

266
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,680
Sir

267
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Are you okay?

268
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,080
Come, come

269
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,920
What happened here?

270
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
Fatty, hold him up

271
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,960
Get up, get up, help him up

272
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Fatty

273
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
Do you have any water left?

274
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
It's been gone for a while

275
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,360
What about you guys?

276
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Old Hu

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
We haven't had a bite to eat since we left

278
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,640
You must be hungry

279
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,560
Help the sir up, let's find something to eat

280
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,040
Okay

281
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,800
Quick, let's go

282
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,360
Slow down, slow down, slow down, come

283
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,280
Slowly, slowly, slowly

284
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
Slow, slow

285
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
There is a well ahead

286
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
Everyone, take a break.

287
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,680
Chandlerpan, help me look after everyone.

288
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,680
I'll go get some water.

289
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,240
Alright, go ahead.

290
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,320
Old Hu

291
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Why are you drinking here by yourself?

292
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,840
That's really not cool.

293
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
What's wrong with you?

294
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,680
Stop drinking.

295
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,960
You stop drinking.

296
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,440
Don't drink.

297
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,320
Old Hu

298
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,760
Water

299
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,680
Someone, come here!

300
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
Old Hu has gone mad, someone come quickly!

301
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
Don't do it.

302
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,240
Don't do it.

303
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,080
You can't drink it. You can't drink it.

304
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
This water is undrinkable.

305
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,280
Hold him down. Hold him down.

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,680
Grab him.

307
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,200
Hold him down. Hold him down. We've got him. We've got him.

308
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,160
Old Hu

309
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,720
Old Yang

310
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,760
What's going on?

311
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,640
Fox urine

312
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
I've heard people say

313
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,120
Foxes can use their urine to cast curses

314
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
He might be possessed

315
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,360
It's the fox again

316
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,120
What should we do?

317
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
It's okay, it's okay

318
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,040
Lay him flat and rub his back

319
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
He'll be fine once he coughs it out

320
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,440
Let me do it

321
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,600
Slow down, slow down

322
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll do it

323
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,040
Girl, come here, come here

324
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,520
Look, it's like this

325
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,120
You saw it all

326
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
This road is very dangerous

327
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,440
This kid is sick again

328
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,680
I think we should all go back

329
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,920
If you want to go back, go back.

330
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,840
I won't go back.

331
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,720
Why don't you listen?

332
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
Keep moving forward.

333
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,760
Who knows what might happen?

334
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,640
That's my own business.

335
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,640
It has nothing to do with you.

336
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,600
If you keep messing around like this,

337
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
aren't you afraid

338
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
something might happen to this kid?

339
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,000
Old Hu

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Hu Bayi

341
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,880
Old Hu, Old Hu, Hu Bayi, how are you?

342
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
How is Hu Bayi?

343
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Old Hu, how are you?

344
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,560
Hu Bayi

345
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Are you okay?

346
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Don't worry.

347
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,440
I won't die.

348
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
So now,

349
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
what should we do?

350
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,720
Should we advance or retreat?

351
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
We'll follow your lead.

352
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,760
Wherever we fall,

353
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
we'll get back up from there.

354
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,400
Keep moving forward.

355
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,520
Okay.

356
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
You kid,

357
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,040
even now, you still won't listen to advice.

358
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
Mr. Yang

359
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,960
Weren't you just fainting?

360
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
How are you awake now?

361
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
I

362
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,240
I

363
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,840
Hu Bayi

364
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,520
There are two roads here

365
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
Which one should we take?

366
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Northeast direction

367
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,840
Go

368
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,160
There seems to be something ahead

369
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
What is this?

370
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Is that a dragon?

371
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,520
Maybe it's a snake.

372
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,880
A python.

373
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,280
Old Hu, there's some here too.

374
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,920
Oh my gosh

375
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,760
Huang Xiangu

376
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,960
The one we met in the Northeast

377
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
Old Hu, look

378
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
There are two pieces here

379
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,120
Is the road ahead

380
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
still passable?

381
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,120
The revolution has not yet succeeded

382
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,040
Comrades still need to work hard

383
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,680
Keep moving forward

384
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Wait, wait, wait

385
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,840
This girl is quite straightforward

386
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,520
Chandlerpan

387
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,720
Let's go

388
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Let's go

389
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,520
Old Hu

390
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,040
Look, what's ahead?

391
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,200
We've arrived.

392
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,800
Kid

393
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Listen to me

394
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,160
You can't go in

395
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm telling you, Old Yang

396
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,800
Everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm is so high

397
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,480
Can you stop pouring cold water on us?

398
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,560
Yes, Old Man

399
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,920
We finally got here

400
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
We have to find out what's going on

401
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,840
I'm telling the truth

402
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
There's a demon dragon in there

403
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,120
That's perfect

404
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
I'll go find my father

405
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,800
And meet this dragon along the way

406
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,560
Girl

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,360
Huamei

408
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,040
Come back

409
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,880
Huamei

410
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,600
Go, go, go, hurry up

411
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Sir

412
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,880
You seem to care about her a lot

413
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
Not even afraid of death anymore

414
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,680
Losing a horse is one thing, but losing a person

415
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,120
Go

416
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Girl, wait for us, let's go together

417
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Go

418
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,760
Let's go

419
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,920
Go take a look

420
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,720
3916 Water Supply Unit

421
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,600
Prohibited

422
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Prohibited that thing

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
It definitely isn't something good.

424
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,520
3916 is a military unit number.

425
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,680
This place used to be a Japanese military base.

426
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
This place is built so hidden

427
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,960
There must be something shady going on

428
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Interesting

429
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,120
Let's go in and take a look

430
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,400
What's up

431
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,120
When others start a fire, you use yourself as a firecracker, right?

432
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
Now Ma Quan is in trouble

433
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,040
If something happens to him, it's all over

434
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah

435
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,400
Comrade Yan Zi

436
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,800
Aren't you usually quite brave?

437
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Why at critical moments

438
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,520
Do you always hold back the revolution?

439
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,320
Being brave isn't about being reckless

440
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,560
It's the good swimmers who drown

441
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,240
This cave doesn't have teeth

442
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,640
It's not going to eat us

443
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,760
You don't have to go in

444
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,520
I'll go in and take a look myself

445
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,120
Hu Bayi, Hu Bayi
