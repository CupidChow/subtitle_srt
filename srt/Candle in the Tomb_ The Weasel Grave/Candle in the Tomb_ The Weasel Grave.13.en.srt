1
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Old Hu

2
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
What is this moldy thing?

3
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,920
So pungent.

4
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
What thing still smells like this after twenty years?

5
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,960
We can handle even the most dangerous places.

6
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Can this smell really scare us?

7
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Back then, Nier helped the Japanese rob tombs.

8
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
They stole many valuable artifacts.

9
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
They are probably hidden in this building.

10
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
We can't find Ma Qun.

11
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
If we can really find these things,

12
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,720
this will definitely be

13
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,360
a great opportunity to make amends.

14
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
Old Hu

15
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,480
Look at this

16
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
At first glance,

17
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,760
it seems to have been abandoned by the Japanese.

18
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
it doesn't look like it was simply abandoned.

19
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,040
Look at this power outage

20
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Blocking the door

21
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
It seems to be to prevent something from coming in

22
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Or

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
to prevent something from getting out

24
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,200
Oh my

25
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
How can people live here

26
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,880
There's not even a door

27
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
It's not that there's no door

28
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
It's a cursed door

29
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
Isn't this crazy

30
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,880
Built the house and then blocked the door

31
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
Comrade Lenin

32
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
I heard you mention it before

33
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,840
There is a custom in the northeast

34
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,880
to place stones in the house

35
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600
to ward off ghosts

36
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,360
This can't be

37
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Xiao Ding

38
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
These sayings are all part of the Four Olds

39
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
just feudal superstitions

40
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Besides

41
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,440
placing stones to ward off ghosts

42
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
is to make people feel at ease

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,320
With this house sealed up like this

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
let alone people living in it

45
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,320
not even a big-eyed thief could get in

46
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,920
It would be better to just tear the house down

47
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,880
Maybe this place can't be torn down

48
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Tearing it down would cause even bigger trouble

49
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,040
That's why so many bricks are used

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,320
to block everything up

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,480
If there really are ghosts

52
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
do you think a few bricks

53
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,440
can block them?

54
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Door

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Run, run

56
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,200
Run, run, quickly

57
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,800
Run

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Hurry

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,120
Right there, hurry

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,640
Run

61
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Quick

62
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
Quick, quick, quick

63
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
Hurry

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
Over here

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Hurry

66
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,520
Help, quick!

67
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Coming, coming!

68
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
Who pulled the lever?

69
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Hurry, go!

70
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
Go, Yan Zi!

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Stop shouting, run!

72
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,120
Come on!

73
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,320
Go!

74
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,240
Everyone, don't panic.

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,760
Did anyone see clearly just now?

76
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,840
What exactly is outside?

77
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,680
The switch couldn't have pulled itself down.

78
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,400
Could it be...

79
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
Someone outside moved the lever.

80
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,720
I saw those white claws just now.

81
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,200
They didn't look human.

82
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,720
Whether it's human or ghost,

83
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
it's really bad.

84
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,640
They're trying to suffocate us in here.

85
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
Hu Bayi

86
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Are you sure?

87
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,720
They come with ill intentions.

88
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,400
Good people wouldn't come.

89
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
We can't get out anyway.

90
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,040
What did I say earlier?

91
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
We shouldn't enter this Hundred-Eyed Cave.

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Now look at us.

93
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
We'd be better off going back and getting scolded.

94
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,760
It's better than being trapped to death in this damned place.

95
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,600
Arguing for so long, it's all nonsense.

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
I led the way

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
I will take responsibility

98
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
According to military strategy

99
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,240
In the face of events, it is important to hold firm

100
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,560
When making decisions, it is important to be decisive

101
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
In planning, it is important to be secretive

102
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
That means when facing difficulties

103
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,640
we must not waver or doubt

104
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,040
we must stick to our principles

105
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,400
When facing opportunities

106
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
we must be decisive and resolute

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
we must not hesitate or retreat

108
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,160
When making plans

109
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
we must be thorough and detailed

110
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
we must not be reckless or blind

111
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,480
As long as we adhere to these three principles

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
we can turn passivity into initiative

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,880
and overcome all enemies and difficulties

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Old Hu is right.

115
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
This building is dead.

116
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,000
People are alive.

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
Nothing is impossible in this world.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,840
As long as you are willing to climb.

119
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Swallow.

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Come.

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,680
Take it.

122
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
The door and windows are all blocked.

123
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
How do we get out?

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
This is just the situation on this floor.

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
Let's check other places too.

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,840
If there are other rooms that are not blocked,

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,920
we will have a chance to escape.

128
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Hu Bayi

129
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,560
Up

130
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
Or down

131
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Water flows downward

132
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,680
People climb upward

133
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,440
Up

134
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Fatty

135
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Come with me to check it out

136
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,840
Let's go

137
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
You stay here

138
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Here

139
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Hey, Lao Hu

140
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,680
We've climbed several floors, look at this

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
It's still the same

142
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,400
Chandlerpan

143
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,760
Let's chat for a bit

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,160
What

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,440
Do you feel something's off

146
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
It's really off

147
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
Be more specific

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Didn't you notice every floor looks the same

149
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
And the doors are all blocked

150
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
Let me ask you

151
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,160
Is it the people or the things that are off

152
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,120
That's hard to say

153
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
Probably both

154
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
Did you hear today's knocking

155
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Isn't it just like last time we

156
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
encountered in the forest

157
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,600
Exactly the same

158
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
You have to admit, it really looks like it.

159
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,120
So Inner Mongolia has such troublemakers too?

160
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,680
Keep your voice down.

161
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Ever since we entered this Hundred-Eyed Cave,

162
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
I've had the feeling something is following us.

163
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,560
Look,

164
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,640
those two hands on the window today,

165
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,400
it's clear they were coming for us.

166
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,200
We'll deal with soldiers with generals, and water with earth.

167
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,160
We followed the Red Sun to conquer the world,

168
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
we're not afraid of any monsters or demons.

169
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
If it's a real ghost, we're not afraid.

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,880
What we fear is someone playing tricks behind our backs.

171
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Are you talking about Old Man Qiaoshan?

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I suspect him too.

173
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,960
But Huamei is with us,

174
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
he has no reason to do that.

175
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,520
Could it be

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
we really encountered a ghost?

177
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,000
Old Hu

178
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,200
Wait for me

179
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Keep your voice down, keep your voice down

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,320
What are you doing?

181
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,480
Nothing.

182
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
Doing nothing is still doing something.

183
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,760
It's none of your business.

184
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,040
Stop pretending with me.

185
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,080
You've been using Old Hu as a tool all along.

186
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Tell me,

187
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,200
what are you really up to?

188
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
He's not a three-year-old child

189
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,120
who listens to my commands

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,240
He's just possessed

191
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm telling you

192
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
when you were possessed

193
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,160
he risked his life to go up the mountain to fight the bear

194
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
and went to the underworld

195
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,720
the first person he saved was you

196
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,320
he would go through hell and high water for you

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,680
don't set him up

198
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,960
and make him jump in blindly

199
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
He has a sincere heart.

200
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,760
You need to have a conscience.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
What are you guys doing?

202
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,160
Looking for the way

203
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,120
With your brain, what way are you looking for?

204
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Come down quickly, Xiao Ding has found something

205
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
Hurry up

206
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Coming

207
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,480
Hu Bayi, come quickly.

208
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Look.

209
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,520
This wall.

210
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,000
It was pried open and then filled back in.

211
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
Could there be something inside?

212
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Xiao Ding, you have sharp eyes.

213
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
You even noticed this.

214
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,760
Chandlerpan, give me a hand.

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,080
Move aside, come on.

216
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,400
Swallow, give it to me.

217
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,400
Look, what is that?

218
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
It's not Russian.

219
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not Mongolian script either.

220
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,720
Dude, he hasn't even fully learned Chinese yet.

221
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,560
This is really unfamiliar.

222
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,800
Don't worry about recognizing the characters first.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Look at this.

224
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't move, don't move!

225
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
Don't open it, there must be something inside.

226
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,280
What's that smell?

227
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
It's a stinky ditch inside.

228
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,360
Darn

229
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,080
The fat guy is holding it

230
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,080
I'll go in and take a look

231
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,079
Come

232
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,839
Grab my foot

233
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,440
Come

234
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,680
Light

235
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,360
What's going on inside?

236
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,320
Inside is a large chimney.

237
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
I think

238
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,000
there's probably a large iron furnace below.

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,120
What are they burning that smells so bad?

240
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,840
Don't be afraid when I tell you this.

241
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,080
During World War II,

242
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
the Germans used gas to kill Jews.

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
They used this kind of furnace.

244
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Look,

245
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,160
this is the fat evaporated from burning bodies.

246
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,800
The walls inside are covered with a layer of it.

247
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,080
Who knows how many people were burned to death.

248
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Such a cruel and inhumane thing.

249
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,960
No wonder they used bricks to cover it up.

250
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
It's not as simple as you think.

251
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
At that time,

252
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
it was no secret that the Japanese were killing Chinese people.

253
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,680
Going to such great lengths

254
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,760
to seal off the entire building

255
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,200
was probably not just to cover it up.

256
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
Let's not talk about this now.

257
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,120
Let's find a way to escape first.

258
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,240
You aren't planning to climb the chimney, are you?

259
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,680
I saw a ladder over there.

260
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
I should be able to jump across.

261
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
What's the big deal?

262
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,880
You think you're the only one capable?

263
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,160
Swallow

264
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
We can't act tough in front of the King of Hell.

265
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,080
Close your eyes and wait for death?

266
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
We can't hide behind Marxism-Leninism.

267
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,840
Doing things half-heartedly.

268
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,480
Making foolish promises when things get tough.

269
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,960
If you ask me,

270
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
relying on yourself is better than asking anyone for help.

271
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,280
Hu Bayi

272
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,840
Take this with you.

273
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
For self-defense.

274
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
Thanks.

275
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,120
Isn't this my Finnish knife?

276
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
Does it have your name on it?

277
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
This clearly belongs to Xiao Ding.

278
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
You actually took your buddy's stuff to show off.

279
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,200
Doing a favor

280
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
You are really mean

281
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
I did it for you

282
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,440
Did it for me

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Ask her

284
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,400
Thank you, Wang Kaixuan

285
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,480
Darn it

286
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

287
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,520
Let's go

288
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,400
Be careful

289
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,760
Old Hu, be careful

290
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
Be careful, Hu Bayi.

291
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,320
Here's a flashlight.

292
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Catch.

293
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,600
Slow down

294
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,360
Be careful

295
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
Hu Bayi, be careful

296
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
Take it easy.

297
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,560
It's fine.

298
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Hu Bayi

299
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,520
Hu Bayi

300
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Hu Bayi

301
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,720
Hu Bayi, Hu Bayi

302
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Hold on tight, quickly

303
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,080
Don't worry about me, close the door.

304
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,120
Close the door, quickly!

305
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,840
Hold it shut, quickly!

306
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,840
What's in there?

307
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,800
I don't know either.

308
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,040
But it's definitely not something good.

309
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Listen to that noise.

310
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
What kind of creature is it?

311
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,640
The crematorium is sealed.

312
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,120
How could there be a living creature?

313
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
Are we blocking the door to keep it in?

314
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,240
It's the ghost of someone burned to death coming for revenge.

315
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
Old Yang, when people die, their lights go out.

316
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,640
Ghosts and spirits are all made up.

317
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,960
What do we do now?

318
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Block it completely.

319
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
Listen, listen

320
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,000
What is this?

321
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,120
Retreat

322
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,960
Retreat

323
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,240
Retreat, retreat, retreat

324
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,080
Old Hu

325
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,600
It's nothing

326
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,200
Be careful

327
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Go

328
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,200
Old Hu

329
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
Go, hurry up

330
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
Go, go

331
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Where are you all going?

332
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,200
Everyone go up, quickly.

333
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,320
Hurry up.

334
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,520
Follow me.

335
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,920
Go.

336
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
Go down, go down.

337
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Hurry up.

338
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,480
Where are we going? Which way?

339
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,960
There's a door there, this way.

340
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,760
Hurry up.

341
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
Hu Bayi.

342
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,840
Move, I'll do it.

343
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,440
Hurry, hurry up.

344
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,480
Open it quickly.

345
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
Open the door quickly.

346
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Go in, go in, hurry up.

347
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,480
Old Hu, where is this?

348
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,600
Why isn't there another exit?

349
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,520
What is this place?

350
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Fatty

351
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Here, catch

352
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,080
Tear the cloth, catch

353
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,440
Why tear the cloth?

354
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,840
Shut up, tear it quickly

355
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,080
Fatty, next

356
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,960
come

357
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,400
what are you doing

358
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,000
what are you up to

359
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,080
I want to make a torch

360
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
throw it into the chimney

361
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,160
burn everything inside no matter what it is

362
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,800
sounds reliable

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
burn the corpse oil inside with a torch

364
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,440
we can climb out

365
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
come and help

366
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,920
Tear

367
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
Hu Bayi

368
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,560
Did you see it clearly just now?

369
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,480
What was it?

370
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
I don't know either.

371
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
It seemed like a python.

372
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,400
I was startled when I climbed the chimney.

373
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
Where did a python come from on the grassland?

374
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,560
Exactly.

375
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,680
Maybe it was brought here during the Japanese experiments.

376
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
Brought from another place.

377
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,480
Tear it quickly, tear it quickly.

378
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,600
What python?

379
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
It's the demon dragon of the northern desert.

380
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Stop talking and tear it.

381
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,240
If we offend it,

382
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,240
we'll be in big trouble.

383
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,280
What?

384
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,000
Who?

385
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,240
Me.

386
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,000
It's not you

387
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,120
No one else, it's just a few of us

388
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
What is that?

389
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
Who opened the door?

390
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,120
Xiao Ding

391
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,480
Fire

392
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
Wha- What is it?

393
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
Ignite

394
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,120
Okay

395
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,360
Old Hu

396
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm going

397
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,880
Run, Xiao Ding

398
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,480
Fatty

399
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,120
Fatty

400
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,800
Hu Bayi, Hu Bayi

401
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Over here, come

402
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,440
Hu Bayi

403
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,320
Hu Bayi, wake up

404
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,000
You go in

405
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
Grandpa Yang, Grandpa Yang

406
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,840
Grandpa Yang, are you okay?

407
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,400
Xiao Ding

408
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,560
Xiao Ding, come back

409
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,320
Get lost

410
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,680
Get lost

411
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,920
Xiao Ding

412
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,480
Get lost

413
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,920
Hurry up

414
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,320
Fatty

415
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,840
Wang Kaixuan

416
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Run!

417
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,880
Run

418
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,080
Hu Bayi

419
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,480
Hu Bayi, be careful

420
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,120
Baby, watch out

421
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,800
Run

422
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,720
Hu Bayi

423
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,920
Child, be careful!

424
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,680
Hu Bayi

425
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,240
Hu Bayi
