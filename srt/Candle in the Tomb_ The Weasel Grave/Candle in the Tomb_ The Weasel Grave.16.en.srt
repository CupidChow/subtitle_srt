1
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
Old Hu

2
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Why are there so many bodies here?

3
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,960
I don't know either.

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,840
Be careful!

5
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Old Hu

6
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Why does this all look like the stuff from the Soviets?

7
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Everything is moldy and growing hair.

8
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
I estimate this corpse transformation

9
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,560
might be related to the environment

10
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,040
This place is very likely already a turtle resting ground

11
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,880
What is a turtle resting ground?

12
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,280
Even a divine turtle, though long-lived, has an end

13
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
Literally speaking

14
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
it means that although turtles live long

15
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
they also have a day when their life ends

16
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
From a feng shui perspective

17
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,800
it is called the place where the four spirits gather

18
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
Since it is a place chosen by an old turtle

19
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,160
it must be a blessed land

20
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,600
Old Hu

21
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,320
Did you notice

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,520
they all died facing one direction

23
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
What does that indicate

24
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
It indicates they were all running out before they died

25
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,400
Also,

26
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,360
their clothing and equipment are all neatly worn.

27
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,040
This indicates that death occurred in an instant.

28
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,840
This death is too bizarre.

29
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you think?

30
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,640
What could be so powerful?

31
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
To kill so many people at once.

32
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Could it be

33
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,160
an accident like a bacterial leak?

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
I think the possibility is very low.

35
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
The water supply unit specializes in studying bacteria.

36
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,200
I guess these people's deaths

37
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
might be related to the bronze box.

38
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
At the moment the bronze box was opened,

39
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
something terrible suddenly happened.

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,880
It killed all the living people.

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
I heard from the blind old lady

42
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,160
that the Yellow Immortal used to open the box to save people.

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
I've never heard

44
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,040
of opening the box to harm people.

45
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
It must be the Japanese

46
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,880
who opened the box the wrong way.

47
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
How do you know?

48
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
Didn't your father tell you?

49
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
Anyway,

50
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
the disaster brought by the bronze box must have passed.

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,720
Otherwise, we wouldn't have made it this far alive.

52
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
There's no need to worry about that.

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
There's nothing to worry about.

54
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
What is meant to come will come.

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
Maybe it has already come.

56
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
We just haven't noticed it yet.

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,160
Sis, what's wrong?

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,920
Xiao Ding

59
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,880
What's wrong with you?

60
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Xiao Ding, are you okay?

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
I'm so sleepy.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,760
You must not sleep now.

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
It will be trouble if the poison reaches your heart.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,720
Fatty, let's quickly go find some medicine.

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Uncle Yang

66
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,600
Please keep Xiao Ding company.

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,120
Talk about what?

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Anything, just don't let her sleep.

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Fatty, let's go.

70
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm coming too.

71
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,400
Go ahead.

72
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh my, it really stinks.

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
Besides the stink, there's also a smell of disinfectant.

74
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Let's search one by one.

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
Make sure not to miss anything.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Alright.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
If you find the antidote, shout out immediately.

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,640
Whether you find it or not, gather here.

79
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,960
Got it.

80
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Let's go.

81
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Thank you, Mr. Yang

82
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
Sweet girl

83
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
When I was your age,

84
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,920
I went with my brother Yang Erdan

85
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,040
from the central plains to the northeast.

86
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,640
We joined the biggest gang in the mountains, the Nierhui.

87
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,360
My brother was lucky,

88
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
he married the leader's daughter.

89
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,880
He took over the top position from his father-in-law.

90
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
The leader had a nephew

91
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,920
who was the accountant of the gang.

92
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,680
He was jealous of my brother becoming the leader.

93
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,600
He tried to sabotage him at every turn.

94
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,240
Later

95
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
my brother was taken by the Japanese devils

96
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
to this Hundred Eyes Cave

97
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,440
pity my sister-in-law

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
who was pregnant

99
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
with a boy or a girl

100
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,960
where are they now

101
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
someone calculated

102
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,680
it was a girl

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
with a rare fate

104
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
Oh my gosh

105
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
This is a place where people die

106
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Eyebrow girl

107
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,440
You said that the box contains something that can save lives.

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,880
Your father said that, right?

109
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
Your dad

110
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,240
Why for so many years

111
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
did he stubbornly stay in the Northeast

112
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,280
And why

113
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,760
did he suddenly bring you to Inner Mongolia

114
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,800
Never said that.

115
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,600
I think it's all about the profit.

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,800
Thinking about the stuff in the box.

117
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,640
Then why don't you tell us

118
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,800
what's inside the box

119
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
and broaden our horizons.

120
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
I haven't seen it with my own eyes

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
but I've heard people talk about it

122
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,040
The Yellow Immortal has three treasures

123
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,480
golden pearls, blood elixir, and dragon talisman

124
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
That's all nonsense

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
Inside there

126
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
it's clearly filled with a resurrection potion

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,920
It seems your father didn't tell you the truth

128
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,280
What year were you born?

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,760
Your father didn't even tell you that, did he?

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Stop trying to trick me.

131
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm asking you.

132
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,120
Have you seen your mother since you were little?

133
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,520
I'll give it to you

134
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,880
sis

135
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
How is it?

136
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
It's fine.

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you find anything?

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,800
We searched every room carefully.

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
Right at the room's entrance.

140
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Found numbers used as markers.

141
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
Couldn't find anything else.

142
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,920
Do you smell something foul?

143
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,320
Like rotting meat.

144
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,040
It's probably the smell of these corpses.

145
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,440
No.

146
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,280
It's getting worse.

147
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,200
The stench is getting stronger.

148
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,400
You guys rest here for a while

149
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
I'll go in and take a look first

150
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
You're already injured

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,480
and still want to play the hero

152
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
I'll go with you, buddy

153
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Sounds good

154
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
Doll

155
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,920
Take this

156
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
I'll use this.

157
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,400
Take good care of Xiao Ding

158
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,920
One Two

159
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,400
Darn

160
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,520
Old Hu

161
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
This is the enemy's vegetable cellar.

162
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
It looks like a pigsty to me.

163
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,200
It smells bad.

164
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
It's even more humid.

165
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,920
This little guy really knows how to find a place.

166
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
There's a bit of light here.

167
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
They even raised pigs here.

168
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
Stop talking nonsense.

169
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,360
I don't think this is a good place.

170
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's leave.

171
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,160
Okay

172
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,880
Let's go

173
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,920
Old Hu

174
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,640
Take it easy.

175
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
The soil is still soft.

176
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
Old Hu

177
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
You say these Japanese people raise pigs

178
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
why are they also planting trees?

179
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,640
Why so much nonsense?

180
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
Can't I just talk?

181
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Just raise a pig if you want to raise a pig.

182
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
It smells like a dead person.

183
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,000
Stop it.

184
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,720
What are you doing?

185
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,720
Old Hu, Old

186
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,360
Fatty

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,920
Old Hu, Old Hu

188
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,320
Old Hu

189
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,040
Old Hu

190
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Old Hu

191
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,440
Save me

192
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,000
Fatty

193
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,800
Old Hu

194
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,080
Go

195
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,120
Get up

196
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,320
Old Hu

197
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
Get up

198
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,960
Go

199
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
Fatty

200
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,920
Old Hu, Old Hu

201
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,680
Old Master Yang

202
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,560
What are you standing there for? Come out quickly.

203
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,640
Go

204
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,320
Go

205
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
Run

206
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,840
Quick, close the door!

207
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Old Hu, didn't you say there were no ghosts?

208
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Then what are these things?

209
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
How would I know?

210
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Maybe they absorbed some yang energy and turned into zombies.

211
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,360
Push!

212
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,240
Grandpa Yang, come over and help!

213
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Grandpa Yang!

214
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
Hold the door!

215
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
Put some effort into it!

216
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,280
Oh my gosh, a ghost!

217
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
What are you doing here? Go back.

218
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Go back.

219
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
What should we do?

220
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,840
Help, help, help!

221
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,840
Xiao Ding, what are you doing here? Do you want to die?

222
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,760
If we die, we die together.

223
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,640
Xiao Ding.

224
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,560
Move aside.

225
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,360
Close the door.

226
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,920
What is that?

227
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Close the door

228
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,720
Darn you

229
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,520
Excellent

230
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Support

231
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,160
Support

232
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,960
Held on

233
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,280
Old Hu

234
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,560
What did you just see?

235
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,080
I saw

236
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
I just saw

237
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
The body was growing on a big ginseng

238
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
The body didn't move

239
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,560
The ginseng was moving

240
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
Fatty, where's the foreign liquor?

241
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
Burn it with fire

242
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
It's been gone for a long time

243
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,560
What the heck are you doing?

244
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,080
Fatty

245
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,960
Retreat, retreat

246
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,120
Go, go, go

247
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Go

248
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,840
Hurry, go, go

249
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,800
Hurry, go!

250
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,640
Go, Xiao Ding!

251
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,880
Go!

252
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,560
Xiao Ding!

253
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,760
Get out, get out

254
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,640
Go

255
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,080
Go

256
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,520
Hurry up

257
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,680
Go, chandlerpan

258
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,720
Here

259
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,920
Hurry, hurry

260
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,160
Close the door quickly

261
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,200
Close the door

262
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,960
Close the door

263
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,880
Close the door

264
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,400
Quick

265
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,360
Pull

266
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,640
Pull

267
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,360
Pull, pull

268
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,480
Move aside

269
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,280
Close the door

270
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,880
Hurry

271
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Old Hu

272
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,480
This door

273
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Is it reliable?

274
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,880
This basement

275
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,640
was built to military standards by the enemy

276
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
even bombs can't blow it open

277
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,160
probably

278
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Old Hu

279
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,320
Do you think

280
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
this person's outfit

281
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
is different from the zombies outside

282
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,960
isn't it?

283
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Didn't the Soviet's diary mention

284
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,440
there are many prisoners here

285
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,320
used as subjects for live experiments

286
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
But looking at this outfit

287
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,160
doesn't it seem familiar

288
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,240
it seems like the legend

289
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,240
of the northeastern mountains

290
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,760
the bandit attire

291
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,720
it looks like it to me

292
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
that's it

293
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,440
the bandits of the Muddy Society

294
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,360
in the temple of the Yellow Immortal

295
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,240
stole some treasures

296
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
as a result

297
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,840
they were betrayed and killed by the devils

298
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
fed to the monster

299
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
We found the Yellow Immortal.

300
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,800
It's possible.

301
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,200
We just saw those bodies outside.

302
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
Many of them were wearing enemy uniforms.

303
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,120
Maybe.

304
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,720
They were all affected by that sudden disaster.

305
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,760
That's why they were taken by the adults.

306
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,840
I thought

307
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
you educated youths were knowledgeable.

308
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,080
What do you call that thing?

309
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,560
It's called ginseng.

310
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,400
That's not ginseng.

311
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
What is it?

312
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,080
It's a plant from the Western Night Kingdom.

313
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,640
A plant that was brought in.

314
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
Old Master Yang

315
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,880
Explain yourself clearly

316
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,400
What exactly is going on

317
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
This plant

318
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,400
was brought from the ancient Western Night Kingdom thousands of miles away

319
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
through the city of Yuan Sha

320
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,960
is highly poisonous

321
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,320
and looks somewhat humanoid

322
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,000
The Western Night Kingdom calls it Yabulu

323
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,680
The Han people call it Corpse Ginseng

324
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,640
It is a

325
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,920
strange plant similar to a Venus flytrap

326
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,040
that thrives in dark, foul-smelling soil

327
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,160
Its roots can extend several meters underground

328
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,240
feeding by strangling humans and animals

329
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,480
to obtain nutrients

330
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,800
Due to this plant

331
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,640
being exposed to various chemicals from the Japanese military base

332
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,280
it has mutated

333
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,440
becoming abnormally large and ferocious

334
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,400
So it uses its roots to entangle corpses

335
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
to attack the living

336
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Now that you mention it

337
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I understand now

338
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,760
That brick room was specially built by the invaders.

339
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
They are cultivating corpse ginseng here.

340
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,640
To develop medicine.

341
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,040
I have read about it in books.

342
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,760
It is said that the decaying flesh of buried bodies in the corpse cultivation ground

343
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,960
is called "Menxiang."

344
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,920
can be used in medicine.

345
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
So I was right

346
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,080
It really isn't a fake resurrection

347
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
Mr. Yang

348
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
You just said

349
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
This

350
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
This corpse ginseng

351
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,200
is poisonous

352
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,280
That's right

353
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Old Hu

354
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
One mine is a pit

355
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
Two mines are also bearable

356
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,520
When there are many lice, they don't bite

357
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,880
When there are many debts, there's no worry

358
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,040
It's okay

359
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,160
You're right

360
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,720
In this world

361
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,440
What can be difficult for a revolutionary youth

362
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,760
I think what Yan Zi said was particularly good

363
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,720
Yan Zi, do you remember

364
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Whatever happens, happens.

365
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,280
What's up?

366
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,080
Xiao Ding

367
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,560
What's up?

368
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,520
Xiao Ding

369
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,840
How are you?

370
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
I really miss

371
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,800
the days we all traveled together

372
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,080
to Chairman Mao's hometown

373
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,600
everyone

374
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,040
held a handful of local soil

375
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
just holding it

376
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,840
tightly all night

377
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,400
without letting go

378
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,640
The next day, my hand was swollen.

379
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
Remember

380
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
death

381
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,400
does not belong to the working class

382
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,480
You must
