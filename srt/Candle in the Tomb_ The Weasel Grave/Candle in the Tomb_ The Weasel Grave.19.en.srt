1
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
I promised you

2
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
Eyebrow drawing

3
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,720
Eyebrow

4
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Eyebrow

5
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,440
Eyebrow

6
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Wake up

7
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Wake up

8
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Eyebrow drawing

9
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,200
Old Hu

10
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
Where did all these little white bugs come from?

11
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Fatty

12
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,000
Quick, take Xiao Ding and the others and jump into the water, hurry!

13
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
This water is from an underground golden well

14
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
It can ward off evil and repel insects, hurry!

15
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Okay, okay

16
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
Xiao Ding, Yan Zi, Grandpa Yang

17
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,200
Hurry, get in the water

18
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,240
Hurry up

19
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,760
Jump quickly

20
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
Quick

21
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,000
Yan Zi

22
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,800
Jump

23
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,600
Wang Kaixuan

24
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Come down quickly

25
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Hurry up

26
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,760
Old Hu, Hu Bayi

27
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Hu Bayi

28
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,040
Old Hu

29
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Come down quickly

30
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,920
Kid, come down quickly

31
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,800
Hu Bayi

32
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,560
Come down quickly, Old Hu

33
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Hu Bayi

34
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,360
Come down quickly

35
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Kid

36
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,160
Come down quickly

37
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Hurry up

38
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
Hu Bayi, come down quickly

39
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
Come down quickly

40
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
Hu Bayi

41
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Come down quickly

42
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,000
Old Hu

43
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,440
Kid, jump down quickly

44
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Hu Bayi, come down quickly

45
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,960
Old Hu

46
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,320
Old Hu

47
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,880
Come down quickly

48
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,760
Hu Bayi

49
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Come down, Old Hu

50
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,640
Hu Bayi, come down

51
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,600
Hurry up

52
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Come down quickly

53
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Hurry

54
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,240
Come down, kid

55
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Go

56
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
You ruined me

57
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
You ruined me

58
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
You ruined me

59
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
Qiaoshan, let go

60
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,880
If you don't let go, everyone will die

61
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Listen to me, Huamei will die too

62
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,560
Dad

63
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,160
Hu Bayi

64
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,400
Old Hu

65
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Hu Bayi

66
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,400
Hu Bayi

67
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Huamei

68
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,520
Huamei

69
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,560
Huamei

70
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,440
Huamei

71
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,920
Retreat

72
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,320
Old Hu, look

73
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,880
Daughter

74
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,760
The moment the thrush opened the copper box

75
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
the light and piercing sound emitted

76
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,840
caused everyone to hallucinate

77
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,160
and lose their sense of direction

78
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,920
If it weren't for that shot breaking the magnetic interference

79
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,240
we might have really been trapped here

80
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,120
forever unable to get out

81
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Facing the morning sun on the grassland

82
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,280
I, who learned the truth

83
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,080
felt particularly relieved

84
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,080
The depression of these past days

85
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,840
was swept away by the warm sunlight

86
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,120
At the same time

87
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,520
the Revolutionary Committee learned of our two-day disappearance

88
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,560
and sent out a team of cavalry

89
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
to search for us

90
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,120
When did you get lost?

91
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
What?

92
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
When did you get lost?

93
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,920
Dreaming of dragons.

94
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,080
I have never dreamed of dragons.

95
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,880
I haven't heard of dragons either.

96
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,440
Lost

97
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,680
Got lost

98
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,880
When

99
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,160
Monkey

100
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
I haven't seen a monkey

101
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Besides

102
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,440
There are no monkeys on the grassland

103
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,680
Is there something wrong with your ears?

104
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,400
Soldier

105
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,480
It's a soldier

106
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,840
A soldier from the Liberation Army saved my life

107
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,880
I still need to thank them properly

108
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,920
Old sheepskin

109
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Your ears didn't have this problem before

110
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,160
Soldier

111
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,160
It's a soldier

112
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,600
A soldier from the Liberation Army saved my life

113
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,520
Miss

114
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
Is there something wrong with your hearing?

115
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
No, there isn't.

116
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
My hearing is excellent.

117
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
Alright, then tell me how you got lost.

118
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,080
I don't remember.

119
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,560
We were walking,

120
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,320
and got lost.

121
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,560
You're from the northeast.

122
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
What are you doing in Inner Mongolia?

123
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,560
I came with my friends.

124
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
What's wrong?

125
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,920
During the days you were missing,

126
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
did you notice where the herd of horses went?

127
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Didn't see

128
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Anyway, wherever Mr. Yang goes, I'll follow

129
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,840
I think this girl might be an idiot.

130
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,320
Let's ask someone else.

131
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
Change, change.

132
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Change, change, change.

133
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
Name Gender

134
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,480
Name Gender

135
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,680
Comrade, I'm asking you a question.

136
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Miss, your name is Huamei, right?

137
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,280
Is she deaf and mute?

138
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,080
Or does she have trouble expressing herself?

139
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,880
Don't waste your time, switch to those two male educated youths.

140
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,200
Are you two alright?

141
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,240
Yes

142
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,480
Hearing

143
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Speaking ability

144
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
All normal, right?

145
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,760
Normal

146
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,480
Then tell me

147
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,880
What happened?

148
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,560
To talk about what happened

149
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
what exactly happened

150
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,680
Exactly

151
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,400
Please tell everyone

152
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,120
what exactly happened

153
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,840
Dear audience

154
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
please don't be impatient

155
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,040
let me tell you slowly

156
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,120
Please tell us

157
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,320
So, the six of us

158
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,280
braved the cold wind, endured hunger and thirst, with our stomachs growling

159
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,520
we were about to reach the end of our rope, with no way out

160
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,960
suddenly

161
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
what happened

162
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
we discovered a cave

163
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,680
inside, there was a chilling wind and a foul smell

164
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
at this moment

165
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,920
there were strange noises coming closer

166
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,600
The sound is getting closer and closer.

167
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,280
We took a closer look.

168
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
It turned out to be a brocade-scaled python.

169
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
It's a brocade-scaled python.

170
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,760
And it's a one-eyed dragon.

171
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,040
And it's a one-eyed dragon.

172
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
This monster had a triangular head.

173
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,680
Its head was like a pot lid, and its eyes were like copper bells.

174
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,440
From a distance, it looked like a big red lantern.

175
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,240
It was four to five feet long and as thick as a bucket.

176
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
Its entire body was covered in scales.

177
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,760
It was crawling towards us with its bloody mouth wide open.

178
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,359
Commander Hu

179
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,880
What should we do now?

180
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,680
What should we do?

181
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,520
Chairman Mao taught us

182
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,800
to sweep away all demons and monsters

183
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,640
with the red sun in our hearts and the east wind under our feet

184
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
dare to compete with ghosts and gods

185
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,319
and not yield an inch to demons

186
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,079
That's right

187
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,480
Now is the time to show

188
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,840
our revolutionary stance

189
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,360
Yes

190
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,760
Several heroic young soldiers were fearless

191
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,360
and charged forward with torches

192
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,520
fighting the monster for several rounds

193
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,960
And then?

194
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
In the face of the righteous revolutionary force

195
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,600
the monster was defeated

196
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,440
and we locked it in the incinerator

197
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,280
Look

198
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,960
But this Jinyin Python was not willing to give up

199
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,560
and fought desperately in the crematorium

200
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,480
spewing yellow poisonous smoke

201
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,840
The poisonous smoke quickly filled the small space

202
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,920
According to historical records

203
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,400
the poison gas of the Jinyin Python

204
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
can kill a horse in one minute

205
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,840
extremely poisonous

206
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
anyone who smells it will surely die

207
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
What should we do then

208
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
Facing this situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak

209
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,440
the young heroes were fearless

210
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,360
We knew well

211
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,080
that we couldn't attack forcefully, only with strategy

212
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,080
At this moment

213
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,040
What happened

214
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
We found gasoline

215
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,960
and a tarpaulin

216
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,760
Suddenly, an idea came to mind

217
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,720
We had a plan

218
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,520
We fought the Jinyin Python

219
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,880
while retreating step by step

220
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
while retreating step by step

221
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
What happened next

222
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,680
We lured it into the gasoline trap step by step

223
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,640
When the time was right, we set it on fire

224
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
How is it?

225
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,000
Under the flames of justice

226
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
the evil reactionary forces

227
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,560
turn to ashes

228
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Just like that

229
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,600
Awesome, right?

230
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Awesome

231
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
You two

232
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,840
You think we're fools, right?

233
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,040
What you are saying

234
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,560
completely defies common sense

235
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
What we are saying is true

236
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,880
Comrade, I'm telling the truth

237
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Next one

238
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,360
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to know what happens next

239
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,800
please wait for me to slowly... don't

240
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,280
No, no, no

241
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,200
Get out, get out

242
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,760
I'm telling you

243
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,200
I also have a big ginseng radish

244
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm telling you

245
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,880
That ginseng moves like this

246
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
It took our Kangxi treasure sword

247
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,440
The hand rises, the knife falls, the hand rises, the knife falls

248
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
We did our best to chase the herd of horses

249
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,160
but unexpectedly got lost near Baiyan Cave

250
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,680
and couldn't find the herd

251
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,720
We were also attacked by wild animals

252
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,880
We had to abandon the horses and hide among the rocks

253
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Our comrade Hu Bayi

254
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,080
Comrade Wang Kaixuan

255
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,720
Comrade Swallow and Comrade Thrush

256
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
While I and Old Sheepskin

257
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,440
were injured and unconscious

258
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,840
they did their best to treat and take care of us

259
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,080
and finally brought us back to safety

260
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,800
Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought

261
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,480
we carried forward

262
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,880
the spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death

263
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,840
and continued to search for the lost herd

264
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
but ultimately couldn't find them

265
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,240
We had to return to the pastoral area and report to the organization

266
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,360
The Revolutionary Committee originally wanted to make your pastoral area

267
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
a model for promoting revolution and production

268
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,360
to support the Dazhai agricultural and pastoral learning

269
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
But after this incident

270
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,920
it might be difficult

271
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,840
Understood

272
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,960
When we return, we must always remember to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism

273
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
Report early and late

274
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,160
Regularly conduct criticism and self-criticism

275
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,440
Summarize experiences and lessons

276
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Strive for greater victories

277
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,120
Ding Sitian

278
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
If everyone had your level of awareness

279
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
Our work would be much easier

280
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,200
I still have many shortcomings

281
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,480
I hope the Revolutionary Committee and the leaders

282
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,440
will provide more criticism and guidance

283
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,800
Look, they are back.

284
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,960
Dad

285
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Dad

286
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,640
Dad

287
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
I just got back from the alliance

288
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,640
and heard that our horse group exploded

289
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,160
What exactly happened?

290
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,440
Don't mention it, don't mention it

291
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,840
I'll tell you, now we're roasting a whole lamb

292
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,800
I can eat it all

293
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Is there any food?

294
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,560
Let these educated youth hurry and eat

295
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,200
Dad, the food is already prepared

296
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Good, good, good, good, hurry

297
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,120
There's food

298
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,800
There's food

299
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,920
Hurry up, hurry up

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,880
There's food, there's food

301
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
Let's go, let's go, Swallow

302
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
Let's go eat

303
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Let's go

304
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,800
Fatty

305
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,280
Save some for me

306
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,120
Hurry up

307
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,280
Sir

308
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,360
I have a few words to say to you

309
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
This time

310
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
Thanks to you, kid

311
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,360
You saved my old man's life

312
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
No need to be polite with me

313
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,840
We went through life and death together

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
These are all minor things

315
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
Great kindness needs no thanks

316
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll repay your kindness later

317
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,480
I have something to show you

318
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,880
Sir

319
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,880
this is

320
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,200
the Eyeless Dragon Talisman

321
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
you mentioned before that the Yellow Immortal has three treasures

322
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,400
this talisman is one of them

323
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
This just looks like an old copper coin

324
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,800
Is it really that magical?

325
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,000
Back then

326
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,400
when I was wandering in the northeast

327
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,160
I picked up a tip from an old shaman

328
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
who said it was

329
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
a great Xianbei witch

330
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,440
forged from ancient meteorite copper

331
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,920
with boundless magical power

332
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,200
It's of no use to me

333
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,840
You are a descendant of the tomb raiders

334
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,240
Maybe in the future

335
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,440
it will come in handy

336
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,080
Sir, this

337
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,320
Let's go eat.

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,160
Eyeless Dragon Talisman

339
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,240
You know about this thing too?

340
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,680
I heard Qiaoshan mention it a long time ago.

341
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,640
Back then,

342
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,920
the Great Xianbei Witch summoned the deep sea dragon fire

343
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
and forged this Eyeless Dragon Talisman.

344
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,560
This kind of dark fire

345
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
is different from the ones on the ground.

346
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,920
It doesn't extinguish when it meets water.

347
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Its temperature and brightness are extremely high.

348
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
So,

349
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
back then, those followers

350
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,960
regarded this talisman

351
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,760
as a sacred token.

352
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,880
The Sixteen-Character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Secret Technique

353
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,480
also mentioned this dragon fire's aura.

354
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,400
It is said to be formed by all the world's bad luck.

355
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
It is said that the person who holds this talisman

356
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,400
can command ghost soldiers and generals.

357
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
However,

358
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,560
if the holder's own cultivation is insufficient,

359
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,240
they will be destroyed by it instead.

360
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,320
Yes, yes, yes.

361
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
That old shaman also said

362
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
that those without fortune who take it

363
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,840
will instead bring disaster upon themselves.

364
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,680
Sir,

365
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,880
Miss,

366
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,840
these sayings are all part of the Four Olds.

367
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,240
It's just feudal superstition.

368
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,800
In this world,

369
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
many things

370
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
cannot be explained by the word superstition

371
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,040
alone.

372
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,280
A thorough materialist is fearless.

373
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,880
Don't scare yourself.

374
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,920
On such a sunny day

375
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,400
why is there thunder?

376
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,120
Hu Bayi

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,200
I don't care about anything else

378
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Just one thing

379
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,960
This thing

380
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,560
must not be kept

381
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,920
Here it is.

382
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,360
Throw it away.

383
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,600
Really throw it away?

384
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,080
We picked this up with great difficulty.

385
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
We could keep it as a memento.

386
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,880
Keeping it will only bring trouble.

387
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
The most frightening thing is

388
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,240
harming others

389
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,560
and harming oneself.

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Old Yang

391
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Did you pick this up?

392
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,400
You can throw it away.

393
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
We should head back now.

394
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,440
Northeast

395
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
or Beijing

396
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,120
First, go back to the Northeast

397
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
then go to Beijing

398
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,760
With whom?

399
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
The fat guy

400
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,520
What about me?

401
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,400
Of course, you're welcome to come to Beijing.

402
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
I promised you before.

403
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
Don't play dumb.

404
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
I'm talking about us.

405
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,360
Give me a straight answer.

406
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,640
What answer?

407
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,040
The truth.

408
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,960
I said it before.

409
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
It doesn't count in front of others.

410
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,240
Chandlerpan is not an outsider.

411
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,040
Between us, everyone else is an outsider.

412
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,560
I won't say it again.

413
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,800
Then say something else.

414
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,520
You are deliberately making things difficult for me.

415
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,680
Have a piece of candy.

416
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,240
Say something sweet.

417
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
No matter how sweet the sugar is,

418
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
no one is sweeter.

419
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
And what else?

420
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
Actually

421
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,800
Can I have another piece?

422
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,880
Take off your pants.

423
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,320
Isn't this inappropriate?

424
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,280
Why are you hesitating like a big man?

425
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
In broad daylight,

426
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,640
someone might see us.

427
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm not afraid, why are you?

428
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,440
Bro, bro, it's not that I'm afraid.

429
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,680
It's just my first time.

430
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
Don't worry.

431
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
I'll be gentle with you.

432
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,400
Not undressing yet?

433
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,760
Then I'll do it myself.

434
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,240
No, no, no, no.

435
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I'll undress myself.

436
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,880
Did you secure the curtain?

437
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,400
It's tight, not even a fly can get in.

438
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,360
Hurry up and undress.

439
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,360
Can you turn around first?

440
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Are you done undressing?

441
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,560
You go ahead

442
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Let me help you, lie down

443
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,640
Yan Zi, stop messing around

444
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,160
Oh my, it's so big

445
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,280
Keep your voice down, someone might hear us

446
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,520
Such a big wound

447
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier

448
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,720
This is sweet flag.

449
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Bear with it.

450
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,080
It hurts

451
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,800
Physical pain is better than heartache, right?

452
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,600
My heart died a long time ago, buddy

453
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,040
It doesn't hurt

454
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,560
About Xiao Ding

455
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,160
You've really given up

456
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,280
A forced melon is not sweet

457
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,160
We don't force things

458
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,320
Buddy, let me give you a piece of advice.

459
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,360
There are countless revolutionary children.

460
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,760
Not good.

461
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,400
You can replace them anytime.

462
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,040
You said it yourself.

463
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,960
If you have the ability, find me one

464
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,280
stronger than Hu Bayi.
