1
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
Buddy, let me give you a piece of advice.

2
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
There are countless revolutionaries.

3
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
Not good, you can change anytime.

4
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
You said it yourself.

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
If you have the ability, find me one.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
Stronger than Hu Bayi.

7
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Me.

8
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
You.

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
You just brag more than him.

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,680
This shows you don't understand me at all.

11
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,880
Buddy, this is called farting under the covers.

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
Skilled in both literature and martial arts.

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Bluffing, bluffing.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,720
Whoever bluffs you is a grandson.

15
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
What are you laughing at?

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Actually,

17
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,200
you have thick eyebrows and big eyes, you're quite good-looking.

18
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
Of course.

19
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Let me tell you,

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,320
once I slimmed down,

21
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,320
I became a heartthrob in Beijing.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
So many young girls

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
stuffed love letters in my back pocket.

24
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
I didn't even pay attention to them.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
What I'm saying is true.

26
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,800
I feel like I've seen this scene in a dream before.

27
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Old Man Yang

28
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,480
Old Master Yang

29
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,400
Old Master

30
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
What's going on here?

31
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
I say, Old Master Yang

32
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,600
Are you playing with fire?

33
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Did everyone see that?

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
This is from the Yellow Immortal

35
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,760
It's urine

36
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh my

37
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,840
This yellow weasel has a really big bladder.

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
It's like a sprinkler truck.

39
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,960
Sir,

40
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
what does this mean?

41
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,560
How did you provoke the yellow weasel in the northeast?

42
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,120
We didn't do anything.

43
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,360
We just caught a golden female weasel.

44
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
And traded it for two pounds of fruit candy.

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,600
The yellow weasel respects females.

46
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,160
You are in big trouble.

47
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,480
There's no such thing as a yellow weasel.

48
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,040
We are atheists.

49
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,640
You guys...

50
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Old Master Yang

51
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Master

52
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
Old Master Yang

53
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
What's going on here?

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,600
Help him up

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,560
Come on, quickly

56
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,200
Old Master Yang

57
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,600
Go inside first

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Be careful

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,960
Hurry

60
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Your father was already ill before.

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,040
After this exhausting adventure,

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,360
his condition rapidly worsened.

63
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,760
He was overcome with anger.

64
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm afraid he doesn't have much time left.

65
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,440
Grandpa Yang

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,960
What's wrong with you?

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,560
Grandpa Yang

68
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,680
Grandpa Yang, are you feeling better?

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Dad

70
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
Dad, why are you getting up?

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Lie down quickly.

72
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
What did the doctor say?

73
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
What illness does Grandpa Yang have?

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm afraid I won't survive the night with this illness.

75
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
After I die,

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,040
you all should

77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
dig a deep hole

78
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,920
and bury me in it.

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,560
Grandpa Yang, what are you saying?

80
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
We don't understand.

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,440
Isn't Old Hu

82
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,520
Grandpa Yang,

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
this is absolutely not acceptable.

84
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,840
Just do as I say.

85
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
Dad, Dad,

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
Grandpa Yang, it's not that we don't agree,

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
but this burial method

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
we've never heard of before.

89
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Besides,

90
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,080
Stop talking.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,680
Just do as I say.

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,520
Dad,

93
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
Did you remember?

94
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,480
You all can go back now.

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,040
I have a few more words

96
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
to say to Huamei.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Go on.

98
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Xiao Ding

99
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Old Master Yang

100
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Go ahead

101
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Daughter

102
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,200
I have already explained

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In the future

104
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,679
No matter where you go

105
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,000
This will always be your home

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,920
There will always be a place set for you at the table

107
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,800
There will always be a bed for you

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,440
In the family genealogy of the Lao Yang family

109
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
You will always be a part of it

110
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Thank you

111
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Uncle

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
When I get there

113
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,560
if I can see your father

114
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
I will definitely tell him

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
My daughter

116
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
has grown up

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,560
Commander Hu

118
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
Do you think

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,320
we should really do as Old Master Yang says?

120
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
No matter what Old Master Yang says,

121
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
we should agree first

122
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
to let him rest and recover.

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
But this is just a temporary measure.

124
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,440
Tomorrow morning

125
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,040
we still need to go to the town to get a doctor.

126
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,720
I agree.

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
Although lying is not good

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,640
our intentions are good.

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
Hu Bayi

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
What's wrong?

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Old Master Yang has passed away.

132
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
No way.

133
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,840
He just took his last breath.

134
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Let's go.

135
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Go back and take a look.

136
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't go.

137
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,560
It's not convenient right now.

138
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
His son

139
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,480
has gathered a group of people

140
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
and they are digging a grave for the burial.

141
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,760
Fatty

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
What's going on?

143
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,280
I just saw a yellow weasel here.

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
In the blink of an eye,

145
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,360
it was gone.

146
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
You really know how to make a fuss.

147
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,440
You must have seen it wrong.

148
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,400
Yellow weasel

149
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
No way

150
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Old Hu

151
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
I think this way of burial is very inappropriate

152
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,360
Old Yang must be confused due to illness

153
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
We can't follow him and act foolishly

154
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,080
I've been in Inner Mongolia for over a year

155
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Grandpa Yang takes such good care of me

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,360
Now we have to bury him this way

157
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
I really can't accept it

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,960
Sis

159
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,560
No matter what we say

160
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,440
It's still the family's decision

161
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,200
Let's not worry about things that don't concern us

162
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
Listen, you all

163
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
What is that sound?

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
You stay here.

165
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,960
Chandlerpan, come with me to check it out.

166
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,600
What's going on?

167
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,120
This thunder is really strange.

168
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,440
It's all my fault for not listening to Dad's advice.

169
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,800
I caused trouble.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Get up and talk.

171
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,840
What exactly happened?

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,720
If I had

173
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,000
buried him the way Dad said,

174
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,680
I was afraid if this got out,

175
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,320
people would say I was unfilial.

176
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,800
So I had to come up with a compromise.

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,960
I wrapped Dad in a white cloth.

178
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
I didn't expect it to cause trouble.

179
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
Thunder and rain are natural phenomena.

180
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

181
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,720
If you ask me,

182
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
we should quickly dig up the soil.

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,560
Alright.

184
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,240
You stay here, the two of us will go.

185
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,320
Let's go, chandlerpan.

186
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm going to Lao Hu

187
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,440
How did this white silk end up like this?

188
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,400
Darn

189
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Old Hu, what's going on?

190
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Is it going to turn into a zombie?

191
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,240
If it really turns into a zombie, that would be simple.

192
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
Chandlerpan, don't forget what we do.

193
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
Speak.

194
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,600
Grave robbers.

195
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Locate the treasure.

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,240
Specialize in talking to the dead.

197
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Chandlerpan, keep digging.

198
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,200
Today, I don't believe in this superstition.

199
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,920
Let's see what's really going on.

200
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Brother, brother, brother, we must not dig any further.

201
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
If it really becomes a zombie,

202
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,440
it could be fatal, brother.

203
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,600
I'm begging you.

204
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,400
Let's fill the pit, okay?

205
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,880
Can't you see it's thundering outside?

206
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,480
A zombie wouldn't appear in this situation.

207
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,400
Okay?

208
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,520
Brother.

209
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Look, it's still moving.

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,240
The corpse can move

211
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
because it decays too quickly

212
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,640
and the corpse gas is trapped by the white cloth

213
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,960
so when it just breaks the ground

214
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,840
it twitches and trembles like it's been electrified

215
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,840
I'm telling you

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
if we don't dig up the corpse now

217
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,480
the corpse gas will eventually seep into the soil

218
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,640
and negatively affect the living nearby

219
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,520
Do you understand?

220
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,400
Is this true?

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
You have that book on debunking superstitions with science at home, right?

222
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,560
It's clearly written in black and white

223
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
See for yourself

224
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,160
Brother

225
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
What?

226
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,480
Well, well, well, let's go with your plan then.

227
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,640
Old Hu

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,880
Why are the mines getting denser?

229
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,600
Where are you going?

230
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,080
Fatty

231
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,480
Ignore him, keep digging.

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Fatty

233
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,000
Retreat

234
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Go!

235
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
Let's go.

236
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,760
Old Hu, don't go again.

237
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
It really stinks.

238
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,280
Old Hu

239
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
What's going on?

240
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,520
Those two yellow weasels from Baiyan Cave

241
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
Where did they go?

242
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
They were handed over to the Revolutionary Committee.

243
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,080
Could it be

244
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,800
he didn't throw it away before

245
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,800
Old Hu

246
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,400
What is this thing?

247
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,440
This is called the Eyeless Dragon Talisman.

248
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,760
It was found by Old Master Yang in the Turtle's Resting Place.

249
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,240
It is said to be a sacred object of the Yellow Weasel.

250
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,280
I suspect this time the Yellow Weasel

251
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
firstly, is seeking revenge on us,

252
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,480
and secondly, is coming for this Dragon Talisman.

253
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,080
Then this is a valuable item.

254
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,640
With it,

255
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,240
we won't have trouble attracting the Yellow Weasel.

256
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,680
You are thinking too simply.

257
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
This dragon talisman

258
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
is very sinister.

259
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Xiao Ding

260
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,920
If Old Master Yang's death

261
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
is really related to this dragon talisman

262
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
it means it is an extremely ominous disaster star

263
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,760
then we definitely can't keep it

264
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,320
Don't, Xiao Ding

265
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,840
We still need it to catch the yellow weasel

266
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,480
Even if you kill a few yellow weasels

267
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,600
what's the use

268
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Can it bring the dead back to life

269
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
Besides

270
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,360
what if something happens to you two

271
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,560
I can't just watch you

272
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,440
go down the wrong path of blind action

273
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,880
I want to throw it away

274
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,720
Let these disasters

275
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
stay far away from us

276
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,880
Xiao Ding

277
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
This dragon talisman definitely has more to it

278
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,360
Don't throw it away

279
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,960
Look

280
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,720
Swallow

281
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,280
Ding Sitian

282
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Thrush

283
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
Do you remember?

284
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,200
Back then,

285
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,800
we almost lost our lives in the Hundred Eyes Cave.

286
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,400
In the blink of an eye,

287
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,760
nearly twenty years have passed.

288
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,400
Isn't that right?

289
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,120
No

290
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
Why are you still being nostalgic?

291
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,640
Being nostalgic is better than being pregnant.

292
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,440
No matter what you're feeling,

293
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,320
if you keep it up, you'll really miss the flight.

294
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm telling you,

295
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,000
I've packed your luggage.

296
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,280
I'll go out and get a taxi first.

297
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,880
You grab the luggage and come find me quickly.

298
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,960
Did you hear me?
