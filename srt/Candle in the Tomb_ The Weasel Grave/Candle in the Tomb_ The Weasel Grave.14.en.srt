Huamei

23
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,760
Retreat

24
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Retreat

Be careful!

27
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
Hu Bayi, be careful

28
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Run!

29
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,920
Old Hu

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
Hurry up!

31
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200
Hu Bayi, be careful!

00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,960
Hurry up

Hurry, hurry, close the door

48
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,040
Old Hu, hurry up

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
Stop looking, run

50
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,720
Hurry

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,200
Hu Bayi

59
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,200
Xiao Ding, go, hurry!

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,920
Get up.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Quickly.

62
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,400
Which way?

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,120
That way.

64
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,960
Lower your head

65
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,360
Go

66
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Hurry

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Over there

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's go

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,640
This thing is here, over here

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Direction

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,880
Run this way, hurry, hurry, hurry

72
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Uncle Yang

73
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Up

74
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,920
Hu Bayi

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Hu Bayi

76
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Down

77
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
There, there, there

78
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Quick, come this way.

79
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,600
Hurry.

80
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang.

81
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,520
Come quickly, there's a house here.

82
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Hurry, hurry.

83
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,200
Stop running, there's a house here where you can hide.

84
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,640
Come over here.

85
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,320
You, you, you.

86
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
Why are you calling me over?

87
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,240
Hurry.

88
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,800
Come over, come over, come over, quickly, quickly, quickly.

89
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
Swallow

90
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,080
Wang Kaixuan

91
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
There's a room here, come in quickly

92
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Up there, up there

93
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
There's a room here

94
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,640
There's a room here, come in quickly

95
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,640
Above you

96
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
Hey fatso, look up

97
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Look up quickly

98
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Above you, hurry

99
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll fight you to the end

100
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,480
Girl

101
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,440
Swallow

102
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,080
Girl, girl

103
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
Wang Kaixuan

104
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,520
Hurry up

105
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
This way

106
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Where is this?

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
Why are we back here again?

108
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,160
Run!

109
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,480
Yan Zi, what's wrong?

110
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Lao Hu, run quickly!

111
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
Run!

112
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,360
This way, go in there, go in there

113
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
Hurry, hurry, close the door

114
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Hurry

115
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,760
Close the door

116
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,720
Hurry, hurry

117
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,600
Close the door

118
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
Hold it

119
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Can I ask you something?

120
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Go ahead.

121
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
The furnace door just now,

122
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
who opened it?

123
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,120
We are all together

124
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,240
No one has moved

125
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,800
Could it be that in this cellar

126
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
there is someone else

127
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,120
This place

128
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,560
is only this big

129
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,320
If there really is someone

130
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,640
Could it be

131
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
they could slip away right under our noses

132
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I heard it

133
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
It might not be a person

134
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,800
Xiao Ding

135
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
What's wrong?

136
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,320
Get up.

137
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,800
There's something wrong with the smoke. Get up.

138
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,040
Move back.

139
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Retreat, retreat, come over here.

140
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Smoke, smoke.

141
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,240
Grandpa Yang, Grandpa Yang, quickly, go to the back.

142
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,280
Quickly, go to the back.

143
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,800
Retreat, retreat.

144
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,680
Old Hu, where are we going?

145
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,920
The chimney.

146
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,760
The chimney, let's go.

147
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
No, it's blocked.

148
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
Come on, retreat, retreat.

149
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,920
We can't get out through the door, and the chimney is blocked too.

150
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,560
Huamei

151
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,040
There's not even a crack.

152
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,720
It's over.

153
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,760
Bro, this time

154
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,640
we're really stuck here.

155
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,520
Old Hu

156
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Bro, I'm hungry

157
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,040
Fatty

158
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,920
We had the same thought

159
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
We should have some hand-grabbed meat now

160
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,920
Can you two be more mindful

161
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Facing death and still thinking about food

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,720
Mainly because of that meal on the grassland yesterday

163
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Didn't get enough

164
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Hu Bayi

165
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
Wang Kaixuan

166
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,760
It's because of me that you came to the grassland

167
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm sorry

168
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,760
I dragged you into this

169
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Xiao Ding

170
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,560
You're being too polite

171
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
If we can die together

172
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
It would completely elevate our revolutionary friendship

173
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
To a higher level

174
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
Right

175
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Remember

176
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
Death does not belong to the working class

177
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,280
This is called sacrifice

178
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,360
In the next life

179
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
We will still be comrades

180
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,320
I have something to tell you

181
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,880
Go ahead

182
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,680
Thank you for saving me today

183
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,920
If it weren't for you

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
I would have been a snack for this thing right away

185
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,440
I didn't save you

186
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,560
I did it for myself

187
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,680
I originally promised to take you to Beijing for two days

188
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Let's fulfill that promise in our next life

189
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
I never took it seriously

190
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
I was serious

191
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Hu Bayi

192
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
I have something to say to you too

193
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Can you wait a moment?

194
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,320
In a moment, we might be dead

195
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,440
If we don't say it now, there won't be another chance

196
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
Water

197
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,680
There's a way

198
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,160
The sewer, the sewer, Mr. Yang, hurry

199
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,160
How is it, Old Hu?

200
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,880
Can it work?

201
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,360
No, it can't

202
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll do it

203
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,080
Come

204
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,600
Be careful

205
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,440
Can it work or not?

206
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,160
No, I can't reach

207
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,440
Move, I'll do it. Hold this

208
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Come closer

209
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,840
How is it?

210
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,320
How is it going?

211
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,360
How is it?

212
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,760
It's open.

213
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
It's open, it's open, it's open.

214
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,280
Chandlerpan, one, two, three.

215
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Hurry, hurry.

216
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,520
I'll go down and catch you.

217
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,839
Okay, be careful.

218
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,520
Be careful.

219
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,000
Chandlerpan, catch Yanzi properly.

220
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,480
Come on, Yanzi, hurry.

221
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Be careful.

222
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,880
Come.

223
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,160
Next, Xiao Ding, come.

224
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
What's that smell?

225
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,079
Down.

226
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,200
Catch properly, Chandlerpan.

227
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Come.

228
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,319
Down.

229
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Come, hurry.

230
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,480
Down

231
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,560
What is this place?

232
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,960
It's been decades.

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
I didn't expect this sewer to still be usable.

234
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
I don't know either.

235
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,240
Anyway, we can't go back to that place.

236
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
I'll lead. Xiao Ding, flashlight.

237
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,400
Everyone, be careful.

238
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Come on, follow me.

239
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
Come here.

240
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,520
Come on, stay close.

241
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
Huamei, thanks to you just now. Thank you.

242
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
I also need to thank you.

243
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
When we return home,

244
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,120
I'll give you two old hens.

245
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
Don't thank me.

246
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,480
If you want to thank someone, thank Ding Sitian.

247
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
If it weren't for her,

248
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
we would all be dead.

249
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,560
Xiao Ding,

250
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,160
On behalf of the organization, I thank you for your quick reflexes.

251
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,880
No, we still need to thank Huamei.

252
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Don't be so modest.

253
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,080
If it weren't for you,

254
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,760
we would all have been poisoned.

255
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,560
There wouldn't even be anyone to collect our bodies.

256
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Sister,

257
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
don't be so humble.

258
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,280
The person I admire the most,

259
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
is the contemporary Soviet hero,

260
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Ostrovsky.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,520
Now,

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
I have started to admire you.

263
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,560
When a person looks back on their past

264
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
they won't feel ashamed for being unproductive

265
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
nor will they regret wasting their years

266
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
and feel remorse

267
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,960
Xiao Ding said it well

268
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,000
When I look back on my past

269
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
I won't regret not

270
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
crawling out of the crematorium chimney

271
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
and feel remorse

272
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,280
nor will I

273
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,320
feel ashamed for crawling through this stinking sewer

274
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,440
and feel ashamed

275
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,120
But everyone, stay alert

276
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,120
In this sewer

277
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,480
we don't know what else is in here

278
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,880
We've only taken the first step of a long journey

279
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
This way

280
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
It's still early.

281
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,960
What's wrong, Old Hu?

282
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Kid

283
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,920
What's up?

284
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
Old Master Yang

285
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,520
Gun

286
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,440
There are still living creatures here.

287
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
It's okay

288
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,400
It's okay

289
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Everyone, go back the way we came

290
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,120
It's okay

291
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
This big rat

292
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
Old Master Yang

293
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,000
What's wrong?

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,720
Gun

295
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,320
Go

296
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
Xiao Ding, give me the flashlight.

297
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,040
It's over, Lao Hu. There's no road ahead.

298
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
Another dead end.

299
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Let me see.

300
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
Why is there no road again?

301
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
There is a door over here.

302
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,360
Oh no

303
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
Such a thick chain

304
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
It's over, it's over

305
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
Looks like we have to go back

306
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
Kid

307
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Try this

308
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Move back a bit.

309
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
Fatty, get on the beam.

310
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,160
Come on.

311
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Come

312
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,120
Good knife

313
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,240
What's wrong?

314
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,160
This knife is really nice.

315
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,320
Come on, Old Hu

316
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,120
Come on, chandlerpan, give me a hand.

317
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,560
One, two, three.

318
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,000
Come on, everyone get in quickly.

319
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,600
Go.

320
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,320
Go.

321
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,080
Be careful.

322
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Come this way.

323
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,200
Come.

324
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
Take it easy.

325
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,480
Oh my, Old Hu

326
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,080
This sewer is like a maze

327
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,400
Here we are

328
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,800
We've been walking for ages and still can't find the door

329
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,560
Everywhere looks the same

330
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
Be careful

331
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Old Hu

332
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,840
Look here

333
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,600
Let me see

334
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
There's something wrong with this wall.

335
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,200
You guys, step back a bit.

336
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,600
I'll go in and take a look first.

337
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,320
Okay.

338
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,520
Chandlerpan, flashlight.

339
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,080
Take it easy.

340
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,680
Hu Bayi, be careful!

341
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,400
Nice place.

342
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,000
Come over here quickly.

343
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,160
There's a room here.

344
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,200
Coming.

345
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
I'll go first and give you the knife.

346
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,360
Be careful.

347
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Come on, chandlerpan, use your strength.

348
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,880
Slow down, slow down.

349
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,840
Are you okay?

350
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm fine.

351
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,560
What the heck is this?

352
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,120
I'm coming

353
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,320
Old Hu

354
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Good stuff

355
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,040
Be careful, it might be poisonous

356
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,440
Very good stuff

357
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,840
Let me see

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,760
Alcohol

359
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,600
Alcohol

360
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,240
How is it?

361
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,160
It's strong enough.

362
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
Let me try.

363
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
What's wrong?

364
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,840
Why is there a dead monkey here?

365
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,040
Young man, don't speak nonsense.

366
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,360
Look closely, is this a monkey?

367
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,600
This thing

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,400
There are many of these in the abandoned graves where we live

369
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,440
What is this called

370
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
Called, called what

371
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,760
Zombie

372
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,080
Don't touch it

373
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,040
If the living don't touch it, it won't come back to life

374
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,440
Don't touch

375
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,120
If you touch it, it will rise

376
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,000
If you don't believe me, try it.

377
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
You go first

378
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,000
Or we can go together

379
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
Let's see who has better luck

380
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,640
Look, what is this?

381
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,480
This is all in Russian.

382
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,400
Xiao Ding, take a look.

383
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,760
Hold it properly.

384
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,920
This is a

385
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,240
diary written by a Soviet scientist

386
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,200
seems to be researching something

387
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,400
Researching what?

388
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,800
I haven't used my Russian in a long time

389
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
I'm afraid I'll translate it wrong

390
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,960
Xiao Ding, don't worry

391
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,120
Let Yan Zi accompany you to the back room to take a look

392
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
We'll talk when we have a lead

393
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
We still have things to do

394
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,080
Let's go

395
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,480
The resting place of the turtle

396
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,520
The dragon's spirit soars

397
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,640
What resting place of the turtle?

398
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
This is just a stinky ditch

399
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,080
Old Hu

400
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,080
I say, this thing of yours

401
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,560
isn't reliable either

402
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
The book says

403
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,320
The resting place of the turtle is a supreme celestial spot

404
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,280
It gathers the essence of heaven and earth

405
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
It accumulates the essence of the sun and moon

406
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,240
Break a branch and insert it, it remains green and does not wither

407
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,320
The deceased are buried naked

408
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
They do not decay, and grow feathers and dragon scales

409
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
It can bless descendants to achieve great success

410
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,360
Stop reading the book

411
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,880
Look at this one first

412
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
If you ask me

413
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,320
Just chop it into pieces

414
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,920
Throw it into the sewer

415
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,480
All done

416
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
Better not

417
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,960
In our hometown

418
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,120
We have to wrap it in a fishing net before burning it

419
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,840
There is a similar saying in the northeast

420
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,480
But it refers to hanged ghosts

421
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Fatty

422
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,920
Do you remember what the blind old lady said?

423
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,240
Let me think.

424
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Wherever someone has been hanged,

425
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
if you dig three feet deep,

426
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,200
you will surely find

427
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,800
something as black as coal.

428
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,600
That is the resentment left by the hanged person

429
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
before they died.

430
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,160
If it is not dug out,

431
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
it will harm people sooner or later.

432
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,040
That's how it goes, right?

433
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,960
There are zombies here

434
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,840
for a few reasons.

435
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
First,

436
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,360
a change in feng shui.

437
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,120
The corpse's energy doesn't dissipate after death.

438
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,600
Over time, it turns into dry wax.

439
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,360
Second,

440
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,760
to prevent decay before death,

441
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,320
the deceased might have

442
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,560
swallowed a large amount of slow-acting poison.

443
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,600
Or after death,

444
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,760
wax and mercury were injected into the body.

445
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,240
If the corpse contains mercury,

446
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
the zombie will have

447
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,280
many black spots on its body.

448
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,560
When struck by lightning,

449
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,080
it can jump up and attack people.

450
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,800
Girl,

451
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,440
you know your stuff.

452
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,240
You also heard this from the blind old lady.

453
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,720
She listened to me

454
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,080
Do you believe it?

455
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
No matter who said it,

456
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
we have to learn and apply it.

457
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,760
This corpse has turned into this state

458
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
definitely due to the environment.

459
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,280
There must be some kind of microorganism

460
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,440
causing the corpse to be preserved.

461
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
Now, even if you stick a branch in it,

462
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,880
it will grow leaves.

463
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,680
Stop talking nonsense.

464
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,640
Just tell me,

465
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,160
what do we do now?

466
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,200
We don't have a fishing net,

467
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,880
nor do we have a black donkey hoof.

468
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,440
I say,

469
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,560
wrap it in cloth and burn it.

470
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
Is this

471
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,880
the final destination for humans?

472
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,840
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

473
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,320
We have been in the Northeast

474
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,200
and experienced many things.

475
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,800
We have seen this kind of thing before.

476
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,960
In our place,

477
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
there is a Huangpizi grave.

478
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,440
It's much more sinister than here.

479
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,840
Right, Lao Hu?

480
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,040
Huangpizi grave.

481
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,160
It's where Huangpizi are buried.

482
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
They bury all sorts of strange things there.

483
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Better not to talk about it.

484
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,400
The things from the Yellow Weasel's Tomb back then

485
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,360
were dug up by the invaders

486
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
There were so many enemies back then

487
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,080
Who knows which group of enemies

488
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
Exactly

489
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
It's been so many years

490
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,280
Who knows

491
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,560
At that time

492
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
What exactly happened

493
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,360
I heard someone say before

494
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,600
when burning a body

495
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,160
the flames will leap higher

496
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
the higher they leap

497
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,240
the more thoroughly the body burns

498
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,200
the finer the ashes

499
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,720
the finer the ashes

500
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,440
the more at peace the person burning the fire feels

501
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,400
as if they see themselves in the flames
