1
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Remember

2
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
Death

3
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
does not belong to the working class.

4
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
You must

5
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
get out alive

6
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
alive

7
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
get out

8
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,880
Don't talk nonsense

9
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,480
We are here with you

10
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,280
This girl has a hard life

11
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,440
We need to think of a way

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,760
We can't let her die in this dark room

13
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,720
The poison has already entered the bone marrow

14
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
What else can we do

15
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
What's the use of crying

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
Old Hu

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
This neurotoxin

18
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,440
If we can't find an antidote

19
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,040
then Xiao Ding is doomed

20
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,880
Old Master Yang

21
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,920
But we can't let

22
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,680
our most important comrade sacrifice themselves

23
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Now is not the time for a memorial service

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
As long as we still have a breath

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
no one can give up

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Hurry

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,680
Fatty, Fatty

28
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
Old Hu

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Fatty

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,720
Don't pull me

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,600
Calm down, calm down, calm down

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
Listen to me

33
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,520
Listen to me

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Listen to me

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
We

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,880
The most important thing for us right now

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,640
is to find medicine for Xiao Ding

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Then

39
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
we will get out of here alive together

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Do you understand

41
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,720
Do you understand

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
What are you standing there for? Move back.

43
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Block the door.

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,480
Okay.

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
Come on, chandlerpan.

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Old Hu.

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Here.

48
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
Quick, fall back!

49
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
Quick, quick, fall back, quick!

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,280
Old Hu

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
Behind you

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,400
Old Hu

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,560
The corpse inside here is the same as the one outside.

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,080
What do we do now?

55
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,760
Let's go inside and talk.

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
Go, go.

57
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
Over here, come quickly!

58
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,000
Old Hu, look at this

59
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
What is this?

60
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Oh my gosh

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,040
Great Xianbei witch

62
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
Great Xianbei witch

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,000
Heaven above

64
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,800
Uncle Yang

65
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
What's wrong with him

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,520
Eyebrow drawing

67
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
What are you doing?

68
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
Eyebrow shaping

69
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,800
Eyebrow

70
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,600
Girl

71
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,680
Girl

72
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,720
Wake up

73
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,600
Sister Ding

74
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Little Ding

75
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,840
Heaven bless, Heaven

76
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Sister

77
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,240
Wake up

78
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
Wake up

79
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,400
Wake up

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
Wake up, wake up, wake up

81
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Wake up

82
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Wake up

83
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Heaven bless us, Heaven bless us

84
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,640
Heaven

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,640
Heaven bless us

86
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,440
Wake up

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Heaven bless us

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
Heaven

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Heaven bless us

90
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Wake up

91
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Heaven bless us, Heaven bless us

92
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
Bless us

93
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,000
Heaven bless us

94
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,920
Eyebrow painting

95
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Old Yang, stop praying and go help out!

96
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,920
Go, go

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Get up

98
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680
Get up

99
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Get up

100
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
Chandlerpan, the potion works, come quickly!

101
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay, okay.

102
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,360
Huamei, Huamei, come back

103
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,520
Calm down

104
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,440
Fatty

105
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
Help

106
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Let go

107
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,280
Come in, come in, come

108
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Calm down, calm down

109
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,920
Fatty

110
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
Useful, quick

111
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
Come

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,760
Hurry

113
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
Doll Bottle

114
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Doll, bottle

115
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,800
Grandpa Yang

116
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Put the stuff there, quickly

117
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,920
Fatty, give me yours

118
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay

119
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Go close the door, go, close the door

120
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,960
Close the door

121
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,840
Come in quickly

122
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
Get in quickly

123
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Grandpa Yang, hurry

124
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,480
Old Hu, hurry, hurry

125
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
Doll, hurry

126
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,920
Doll, hurry

127
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
Hurry, hurry

128
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Old Master Yang

129
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,720
Quick

130
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Hold on

131
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,840
Huamei, come help quickly

132
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
Huamei

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
Huamei, come help quickly

134
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,160
Huamei

135
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,640
Wawa, hurry

136
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
Huamei

137
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
Help quickly

138
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Hurry, Wawa

139
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Push

140
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,880
Quickly

141
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,360
Wawa, hurry up

142
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Come in quickly

143
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Wawa

144
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,440
Old Hu

145
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Wawa

146
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
Quickly

147
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Old Hu

148
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,520
Quickly, hold on, hold on

149
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,080
Xiao Ding, Xiao Ding, Xiao Ding

150
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Oh my God

151
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,280
When will this end?

152
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,400
Can we still go out?

153
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,400
If we can't go out, just let us know

154
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,600
Stop scaring us with these monsters

155
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,360
Yan Zi

156
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,360
Don't cry

157
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,400
Yes

158
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,040
These corpse ginsengs are usually underground

159
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
They don't attack people

160
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Unless something provokes them

161
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,400
What do you mean?

162
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,440
I can't say for sure

163
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,760
But something feels off

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,640
This is the entrance to hell.

165
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,880
If you want to survive,

166
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,000
then shut up.

167
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,440
Is there still hope for this girl?

168
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,880
As long as I am alive

169
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,040
she must live

170
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,360
Chandlee, hurry up and find the medicine

171
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
Old Hu

172
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,040
Push away

173
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,400
Yellow weasel head

174
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,840
The texture of bronze

175
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,440
It all matches

176
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,680
I heard from the old blind lady

177
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,880
The treasure in this box

178
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,400
Is worth more than gold and silver

179
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,200
Just this broken thing

180
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,440
You can find plenty of these at the Panjiayuan Antique Market

181
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Give it to me

182
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,720
You can't hit

183
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,280
Let go

184
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,120
If you open it, none of us will survive

185
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
Huamei

186
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't do it

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,400
What are you doing

188
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
Are you addicted to fighting

189
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
It's about to open

190
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,080
It will surely bring a great disaster

191
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,320
It's life-saving

192
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,880
You can't hit

193
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,280
You have no idea

194
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,800
Hold on

195
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
Let go

196
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
You can't hit

197
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
This is life-saving

198
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
You can't hit

199
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,720
Huamei

200
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,800
You can't hit

201
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,160
Quick, the bag

202
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,000
Give it to me

203
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,240
Give it to me

204
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,640
The bag

205
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,599
The bag

206
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,839
Give it to me

207
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,319
Come here

208
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,440
Let go of me

209
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,400
Afraid to die, huh?

210
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm not afraid to die

211
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,200
But I definitely don't want to seek death

212
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,080
That box may be small

213
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,680
But I think it's a small temple with a big evil wind

214
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
A shallow pond with many turtles

215
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
The Japanese who died in the secret passage wanted to escape

216
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Why did they want to escape?

217
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,080
Annoying

218
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,360
Alright

219
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
So many people have died here inexplicably

220
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,640
Could it be because

221
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
It's related to them opening this box

222
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,160
We haven't died yet

223
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Could it be because we haven't opened that box

224
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,280
Since we entered this research institute

225
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,120
We don't know how many times we've died

226
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,400
One more time won't make a difference

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,840
I'll leave the box here

228
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,320
Open it or not, it's up to you

229
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,560
Old Hu, this box

230
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,440
Whatever

231
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,400
Find medicine

232
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
Old Hu

233
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,840
You said this antidote

234
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
is an injection

235
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,920
a liquid or a pill

236
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
I don't know, it could be any of them

237
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,560
You're not saying anything useful

238
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,160
These are all foreign characters, I can't understand them.

239
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,120
Chandlerpan, look carefully.

240
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,160
Some Japanese characters are similar to Chinese characters.

241
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Let's split up and search.

242
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,440
You over there, me over here.

243
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,080
Okay.

244
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,960
Do you have anything over there?

245
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,160
Seems like there's nothing.

246
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,320
What about your side?

247
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Nothing here either.

248
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
I heard

249
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,640
that the thing inside the box

250
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,120
if eaten, can

251
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,040
bring someone back to life

252
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Did Qiaoshan tell you that?

253
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
None of your business.

254
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,440
Silly girl.

255
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,200
That thing can't cure or save anyone.

256
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,240
Then what is it used for?

257
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,720
It's used for summoning spirits.

258
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,280
Open it.

259
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
It can bring the dead back to life.

260
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,320
Impossible.

261
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,440
That thief from Qiaoshan is full of lies.

262
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,560
He was injured in his lower body years ago.

263
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
He can't have children.

264
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,680
You treat a thief as family.

265
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,720
And you're still in the dark about it.

266
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Then why

267
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,520
did he raise me to this age

268
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,640
In 1949, a heavy snow blocked the mountain

269
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
He gave me the last bite of food

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
and went down the mountain to find food for himself

271
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,720
I was possessed by a yellow weasel's evil spirit

272
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
At his old age

273
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
he went to fight a bear

274
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,280
Not his biological child

275
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,960
Why did he save me?

276
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Isn't it because he saw your fate?

277
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,080
Fate

278
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,600
A fate one in ten thousand

279
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,720
He raised you

280
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
just for the day

281
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,640
you would open this bronze box

282
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,280
That was during the Yuan Dynasty

283
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,720
The Great Xianbei witch discovered the resting place of the turtle

284
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,760
This place is surrounded by mountains, with water and food.

285
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,840
Suitable for survival.

286
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,080
The great Xianbei witch was here.

287
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,720
She developed her own power.

288
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,680
The court feared their power was too strong.

289
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
And would lose control.

290
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,160
So they launched a siege against them.

291
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,800
In the end, the great Xianbei witch was defeated.

292
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,040
At the final moment of life and death,

293
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,480
The witch told her people to take the box and leave.

294
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,920
Never let the entire clan's lineage end.

295
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,120
Wait until one day they find her successor.

296
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,120
In the year of Bingxu, month of Xinchou, day of Xinchou,

297
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,040
A girl born at the hour of Zi.

298
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
Using the spirit of the Yellow Immortal to possess her,

299
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,960
Open the box at the place of the turtle's rest.

300
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,000
It can summon the souls of their deceased clan members.

301
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
And bring them back.

302
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,840
People can be resurrected and rebuild their power.

303
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,640
After the witch died

304
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,000
the tribe members scattered to various places

305
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,440
some of them became bandits

306
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,320
and formed a group called the Mud Gang

307
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
Later, the descendants of the Nie'er Society

308
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,520
never gave up looking for the witch's heir

309
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,680
until the Japanese arrived

310
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,520
and heard this legend

311
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,480
they also wanted to find a way to summon spirits

312
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,240
they wanted to summon the souls of dead soldiers

313
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,000
to increase their own forces

314
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,880
and thereby conquer all of China

315
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Unexpectedly, the Japanese

316
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
quickly found the resting place

317
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
and built a research facility there

318
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,600
and also found the people of the Nie'er Society

319
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,400
They said they could help them revive their power.

320
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,920
They used the people of the Nie'er Society to find the box.

321
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,640
The Japanese took the box but then reneged.

322
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
And killed Yang Erdan's brother.

323
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
Yang Erdan sought revenge against the Japanese.

324
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Without an heir,

325
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,560
he opened the box.

326
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,520
And perished together with the Japanese.

327
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,480
Unexpectedly, Yang Erdan's wife

328
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,040
gave birth to a baby girl in the year of Bingwu, month of Xinchou, day of Xinchou.

329
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,680
gave birth to a baby girl.

330
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,680
Qiaoshan received this news.

331
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,000
He took the baby girl and raised her.

332
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
So that one day,

333
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
the girl could open the box.

334
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,160
To help him summon thousands of ghost soldiers.

335
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
And revive the Nie'er Society.

336
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
Girl,

337
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
were you born at that time?

338
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
Stop talking

339
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,600
Impossible

340
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,120
I don't believe it

341
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,760
Heaven above

342
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
If I tell even half a lie

343
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,560
I will die a terrible death

344
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
Impossible

345
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Impossible

346
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,240
Oh my

347
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,840
Such a big lizard

348
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,760
Look down

349
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,400
This is not a lizard

350
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,840
It's a python bone

351
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,560
Old Hu

352
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,840
This is much bigger than the one we saw in the furnace

353
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
Do you think this medicinal wine made from the python

354
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
could be an antidote

355
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,720
In the world, everything has its counter

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,400
I've never heard of something countering itself

357
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,560
Python bones can't neutralize python venom

358
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,960
This is common knowledge

359
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
Old Hu

360
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,840
We have been poisoned by the Yabulu toxin.

361
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,760
Fatty

362
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,480
It looks like we're going to die here.

363
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,840
Do you remember

364
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,880
when I fought that little punk from Dongsi alone

365
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,760
and he almost killed me

366
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
At that time

367
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,600
everyone was watching

368
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,160
only you rushed over

369
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,160
give me a word, buddy

370
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,360
if you want to die

371
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
I'll die with you, buddy

372
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,880
then without a word

373
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,280
you charged forward with a brick

374
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,320
from that moment on

375
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
Bro, I acknowledge you

376
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,800
Actually, I regretted it at that moment.

377
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,800
I don't even know where that burst of energy came from.

378
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,640
Old Hu

379
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,040
I've followed you for so many years

380
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Worth it.

381
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,800
But you know, you're quite a jerk.

382
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,400
A buddy asked you to handle this small task.

383
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,320
And you still haven't done it for me.

384
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,440
Xiao Ding

385
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,800
You have to save me no matter what.

386
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,440
You owe me for this.

387
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,240
Bro, I'm giving it back to you now.

388
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,560
What is this?

389
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,680
Gecko, a big gecko. Here, take it.

390
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,240
How do you know this thing can detoxify?

391
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
How will we know if we don't try?

392
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,360
I was bitten by a poisonous scorpion when I was a kid.

393
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,280
My arm swelled up like a bucket.

394
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,080
I was taken to the hospital and almost had to have my arm amputated.

395
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
Is it open?

396
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,640
Come.

397
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,040
Come.

398
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Okay.

399
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Come, lift the cover.

400
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,600
Eating this big gecko cured it.

401
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
Come on, chandlerpan.

402
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Look here

403
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
This is called Qi Hong Xiang

404
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,200
I heard from my grandfather

405
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,160
As long as you place a jar of Qi Hong Xiang

406
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,200
in the house

407
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,040
snakes, ants, and mosquitoes won't dare to come near

408
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,280
Mojin Xiaowei

409
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,720
even knows this

410
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
Yin-Yang Feng Shui

411
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,200
seeking medicine to cure illnesses

412
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,560
are fundamentally connected

413
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,640
I hope you can be reliable for once.
