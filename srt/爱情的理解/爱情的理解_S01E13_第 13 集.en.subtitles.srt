00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,701
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

3
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,297
Can we meet right now?

4
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:48,024
When I was in college,
there was a girl whom I liked.

5
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,864
But one day, her cousin visited me.

6
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,828
That was when I found out
how incredibly rich they were.

7
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,295
He told me to break up.

8
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,092
My pride was hurt,
and I was going to end it.

9
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,972
But whenever I saw her,
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

10
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,103
So I slept…

11
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,772
with her best friend.

12
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,279
Sleeping with someone
isn't a big deal these days.

13
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,449
But back then, I thought
it was the worst betrayal.

14
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,665
So what did you get from doing that?

15
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,378
Closure.

16
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,049
An irrevocable…

17
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,137
ending.

18
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,393
Hello?

19
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,152
-Who is this?
-Mr. Jeong?

20
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,280
Sorry?

21
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
JEONG JONG-HYEON

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,367
It's Section Chief So Gyeong-pil.

23
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,914
I see.

24
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,084
But why are you answering her phone?

25
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,214
What about you, Mr. Jeong?
Why are you calling her at this hour?

26
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
By any chance, are you with her right now?

27
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,389
Why?

28
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,310
There's probably a reason for that, right?

29
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,652
Su-yeong and I are in a relationship.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,694
I see.

31
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,072
So what?

32
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,826
So tell me.

33
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,914
Why are you answering
Su-yeong's phone at this hour?

34
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,963
Put her on the phone right now.

35
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,260
Sure thing.

36
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,920
The phone you have called is turned off…

37
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,469
Are you sure you won't regret it?

38
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,226
I won't.

39
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,374
JEONG JONG-HYEON

40
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,962
Yes, Jong-hyeon.

41
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,091
We'll talk after work.

42
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,951
You're here.

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,753
Why did you leave
all of a sudden yesterday?

44
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,739
Is it true?

45
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,952
-Let's talk outside.
-Answer me!

46
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,538
-Jong-hyeon--
-I'm asking you a question!

47
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,543
Tell me.

48
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,758
You already know the answer.

49
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,574
What are you doing?

50
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,368
-Let me go!
-Mr. Jeong!

51
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,246
What? Is there something
between you and Su-yeong too?

52
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,083
Did you sleep with her too?

53

EPISODE 13

55
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,589
Who knew Ms. Ahn
and Mr. Jeong were dating?

56
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,346
Mr. Ma, you saw them
eating lunch at the park, right?

57
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,722
Is that when it began?

58
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,768
Then what about Mr. So?

59
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,103
What do you think?

60
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,525
The great Ms. Ahn dated Mr. Jeong
and saw Mr. So on the side.

61
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,487
Let's open for business.
The clients are waiting.

62
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,490
Hey, you.

63
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,660
Make sure you keep
Mr. Kim of the Sindo branch quiet.

64
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,538
If word gets out,
the Youngpo branch will be humiliated.

65
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,123
He wouldn't do that.
We all work for the same bank.

66
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,084
What's going on at this bank, anyway?

67
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,463
One person pretends
as if his mistress is his wife.

68
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,217
Another one gets married, has an affair,
and becomes an online community star.

69
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,427
And now a dirty scandal that got physical…

70
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,680
We need to perform
an exorcism or something.

71
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,059
I want an explanation.

72
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,646
He misunderstood, right?

73
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,857
Mr. Jeong misunderstood you.

74
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,028
No, it's true.

75
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,948
I slept with Su-yeong.

76
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,747
Is that why Mr. Jeong punched you?

77
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,918
I sent him a voice recording.

78
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,045
What?

79
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,632
I saw in the morning that
he had called me over 20 times.

80
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,011
I thought he'd take it the wrong way,
so I let him know

81
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,180
that this was all Su-yeong's idea.

82
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,932
Man.

83
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,311
I didn't think he'd go even crazier
after hearing the recording, though.

84
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,148
What did you record?

85
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,277
Do you want to hear it?

86
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,239
Are you sure about this?

87
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,327
Yes.

88
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,536
ALL RECORDINGS

89
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,496
Don't change your mind and blame me--

90
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,873
It won't happen.

91
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,593
There's more.
So do you want to hear the rest?

92
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,140
You crazy bastard!

93
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,810
You scumbag.

94
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,812
Why did you…

95
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,523
Why am I a scumbag?

96
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,276
What?

97
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,278
Do you think…

98
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,156
you're any different?

99
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,497
How is my behavior any different
from what you tried to do to Mi-gyeong?

100
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,922
Jeez, why did you hit me
where I got punched earlier?

101
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,867
Su-yeong.

102
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,957
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,918
What do you mean?

104
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,255
Did you and Gyeong-pil really…

105
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,050
Did you have feelings for him?

106
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,682
Did you just smirk?
Is this funny to you?

107
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,111
KCU BANK

108
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,667
Ms. Park.

109
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,922
Are you and Sang-su all right?

110
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:44,013
I mean, Mr. Jeong asked Sang-su
if he slept with Ms. Ahn too.

111
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,434
That's not true, of course.

112
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,897
Right, Sang-su?

113
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,650
We have nothing to do
with what just happened,

114
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,527
so don't get us involved.

115
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,740
She's right, Sang-su.
Don't get involved in this.

116
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,869
I always knew Gyeong-pil
would get himself in trouble one day.

117
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,621
But this is just so random…

118
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,807
-I'll get going now.
-Okay.

119
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,168
Why are you so shocked?

120
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,965
Why do you look so blown away?

121
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
How could you do that to me
for someone like her?

122
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,097
Why are we the ones
who have to feel this way?

123
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,145
Do you still like her?

124
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,900
Do you still like Su-yeong?

125
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,282
Are you really okay
with what happened today?

126
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,078
Say something!

127
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,622
Mi-gyeong.

128
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,501
Later…

129
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,255
Later.

130
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,693
No, it's true.

131
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,321
I slept with Su-yeong.

132
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,948
Are you sure about this?

133
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,867
Yes.

134
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,203
Don't change your mind and blame me--

135
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,997
It won't happen.

136
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,216
This looks good.
Let's go ahead and proceed.

137
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,262
Mr. Ha?

138
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,060
Yes, sir. I'll have everything prepared.

139
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,083
So guess what I did?

140
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,964
I destroyed it myself.

141
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,155
YANG SEOK-HYEON:
WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S GRAB A DRINK

142
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,985
Did you think I'd be gone?

143
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,335
I thought about it all day,

144
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,296
but I still don't get it.

145
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,008
Why?

146
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,305
Why did you do that?

147
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,353
Why are you doing this to me?
Did I do something wrong?

148
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,608
You didn't do anything wrong.

149
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,700
No, I was wrong.

150
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,786
No matter how angry I was,

151
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,955
I shouldn't have acted that way
in front of everyone.

152
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,500
There must be a reason.

153
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,335
Right?

154
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,714
There must be a reason why you did that.

155
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,258
You wouldn't just…

156
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,136
do something like that.

157
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,183
I'm sorry.

158
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,833
What…

159
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,545
happens to us now?

160
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,968
You're looking for a place.

161
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,766
Study for your exam…

162
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,730
and find someone
who is a better match for you.

163
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,402
Then you can start over
and live a good life.

164
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,121
Live a good life?

165
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,835
What happened at the bank…

166
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,716
I said we'd talk after work.

167
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,930
Live a good life?

168
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,484
Can I join you for a drink?

169
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,133
Thank you for before.

170
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,678
When my wife got into an accident…

171
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,764
you took her to the hospital.

172
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,726
Don't mention it.

173
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,523
Are you close to Su-yeong?

174
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,328
I…

175
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,498
I like her.

176
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,011
Is she…

177
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,264
giving you a tough time?

178
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,561
No, it's not that.

179
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,612
She grew up a little too early.

180
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,948
It's our fault.

181
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,367
Who knows what burden
she carries in her heart?

182
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,289
I may be her father,
but I don't know what's on her mind.

183
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:06,171
Still, she's a kind
and warmhearted person.

184
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,049
She'd rather get hurt
than see others in pain.

185
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,554
Yes, I know that.

186
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,976
Come with her next time.

187
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,895
I'll cook something good.

188
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,440
Yes, I'll do that.

189
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,284
Mi-gyeong!

190
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,538
Goodness. Wake up and come out.

191
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,042
-Wake up!
-Mom, this is breaking and entering.

192
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,129
Then you should've answered your phone.
I ran over because you didn't pick up.

193
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,589
-Why?
-Look.

194
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,303
Where did you get this?

195
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,472
That's not important right now.

196
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,140
Your cousin sent it to me.

197
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,809
Everyone at the bank knows.

198
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,646
Is this why Sang-su dumped you? Is it?

199
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,360
Tell me.

200
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,537
Turn it off. Right now!

201
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,039
-Let me go!
-Mr. Jeong!

202
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,752
It was like a movie.

203
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,380
They looked good on the screen.

204
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,385
When something like this happens,
I should be informed immediately.

205
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,096
I shouldn't have to hear
about this from the director!

206
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,974
Burying your head in the sand
won't make this go away!

207
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,394
And what were you doing, Mr. Noh?

208
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,604
Well…

209
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,483
It was before we opened,
so only our staff members…

210
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,653
Mr. Kim from the Sindo branch was here,

211
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,198
but I never thought
he would record a video of it.

212
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,285
The important thing is that

213
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,705
Mr. Ma said he'd make sure
to keep Mr. Kim's mouth shut, so--

214
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,916
The problem is that
he didn't keep his mouth shut!

215
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,544
You should be glad that I intervened.

216
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,423
What if HQ had found out about this?
How humiliating would that have been?

217
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,307
Everyone, listen up.

218
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,727
Mr. Jeong caused all this.

219
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,396
It's all on him.

220
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,400
Then…

221
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,195
are you telling us to fire him?

222
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,031
He was already fired this morning.

223
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,869
If anyone asks what happened
at our branch, that's what you tell them.

224
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,080
That Mr. Jeong completely lost his mind.

225
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,000
How dare some hiring-service staff
disgrace our bank like this?

226
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,461
Is this something
to get fired over, though?

227
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:55,465
What do you suggest, then?
Should we blame Mr. So or Ms. Ahn?

228
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,010
No matter what we do,
we'll end up disgraced.

229
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,305
It's better to get rid of him
instead of one of our own.

230
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,520
Hey.

231
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,651
When you're at the bank,
just focus on work, okay?

232
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,961
-Hello.
-Hello.

233
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,045
Hello.

234
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,174
I can't believe they fired him right away.

235
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,467
He was with us for so long.

236
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,512
We're not all the same,
even if we work at the same bank.

237
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,520
Mr. Jeong wouldn't have wanted
to stay here and work anyway.

238
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,191
Anyway, why did Ms. Ahn
take a half day after the mess she caused?

239
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,320
She's interviewing
for a position transfer.

240
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,405
My gosh.

241
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,575
She's really scary, isn't she?

242
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,871
She makes a fool out of two guys,
then carries on with her business.

243
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,539
I'm going to HQ for training.

244
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,166
Okay.

245
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:27,098
KCU BANK
POSITION TRANSFER INTERVIEW

246
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,808
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong? Come in.

247
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,062
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong.

248
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,484
You applied for a transfer
last quarter as well.

249
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,819
You're in a permanent position.

250
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,948
Is there a reason
you constantly apply for a transfer?

251
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,911
There's no longer
a big difference in bonuses anyway.

252
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,213
You asked the same question last time.

253
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,592
Although a lot of employees
wish to transfer positions,

254
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,969
it's not easy to do so.

255
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,766
How about trying harder
in your current position?

256
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,479
What do you think is the reason
you keep failing the interview?

257
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,692
I'd like to ask the same.

258
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,619
I check all the boxes
in terms of test scores,

259
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,496
performance, and attendance.

260
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,999
I wonder what keeps me
from passing the interview.

261
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,629
When the bank is short-handed,

262
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,797
we're told to offer help

263
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,758
including off-site work
wine and dine duties.

264
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,931
So, I wonder why you won't
acknowledge our efforts.

265
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,062
Are you here to complain?

266
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,608
No, I'm purely curious.

267
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,822
I want to know why…

268
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,870
I couldn't fit
in the boundaries the bank drew.

269
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,934
KCU BANK
SENSITIVITY TRAINING

270
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,482
-Is it true?
-I already told you.

271
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,192
You even saw the video.

272
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,945
Is it true that Ms. Ahn made a scene
by two-timing her boyfriend

273
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,947
and sleeping with Mr. So?

274
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:53,953
If Mr. Ha had hooked you up with her,
you might've been in the video instead.

275
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,705
Mr. Kim.

276
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,125
Why did you record that video?

277
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,126
Just because.

278
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,170
I shared it because I thought it'd be fun,

279
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,173
but your branch manager got mad,
so I had to take it down.

280
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,346
Are you worried
about getting tangled up in all this?

281
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,682
Don't worry. Everyone blames Ms. Ahn.

282
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,145
She had an affair with a section chief
while dating a security guard.

283
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,441
If I had known she was like that,
I would've hit on her too.

284
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,234
Hey, isn't that a little gross?

285
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
Why? I wouldn't date her.

286
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,947
-A one-night stand would be enough.
-Watch it.

287
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,616
She used to act so high and mighty.

288
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,534
You really dodged a bullet.

289
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,620
I told you to watch it.

290
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,042
What?

291
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,835
Why?

292
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,046
Is there something between you two?

293
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,050
Did you two sleep together?

294
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,302
What's your problem?

295
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,932
It was just a joke.

296
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,810
Come on.

297
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,238
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

298
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,136
Doors are closing.

299
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,942
Doors are closing.

300
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,245
Did your interview go well?

301
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,543
Yes.

302
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,924
I'm glad it went well.

303
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,038
Why are you following me?

304
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,630
And why are you smiling?

305
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,932
Why won't you ask me anything?

306
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,854
I know you're curious.

307
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,607
I know you're angry
and that you despise me.

308
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,735
Everyone's bad-mouthing me
and wants answers,

309
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
but why aren't you the least bit curious?

310
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,453
How could you…

311
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,667
How could you be so indifferent?

312
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,187
Hey, Sang-su got himself in trouble.

313
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,316
He grabbed Mr. Kim
of the Sindo branch by the collar at HQ.

314
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,153
It was vicious,
and he did it in front of everyone.

315
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,696
Mr. Kim got absolutely furious

316
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:01,659
and asked if there was something
between Ms. Ahn and Sang-su.

317
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,828
What is he talking about?

318
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,663
We work at the same branch.

319
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,915
The jerk took a video and shared it.

320
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,084
He deserved to get grabbed by the collar.

321
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,712
I'm glad Sang-su did that.

322
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,922
-Yes, I agree.
-Wait.

323
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:20,428
So Ms. Ahn's scandal

324
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,265
has nothing to do with Sang-su, right?

325
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,019
Let's just go have lunch.

326
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,437
Of course, it doesn't.

327
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,773
I heard what happened,
and I could see why he got mad.

328
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:38,196
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go eat lunch with Mr. Ha.

329
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,406
-Okay. Go on.
-Thank you.

330
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,758
Don't go inside.

331
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,220
They think we're having lunch.

332
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,895
I heard you grabbed his collar
while everyone was watching.

333
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,357
Why did you do that?
What are you going to do now?

334
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,819
You keep making messes
that I have to clean up.

335
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,321
You don't have to.

336
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,410
It's hard not to.

337
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,372
Don't do it.

338
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,252
Don't cover for me, Mi-gyeong.

339
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,969
Go get lunch on your own.

340
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,929
I have somewhere to be.

341
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,649
KCU BANK

342
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,175
I really didn't want to ask you this.

343
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,385
Then don't.

344
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,680
What do you think you're doing?

345
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,059
-What?
-Why are you still so immature?

346
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,562
Because people never change.

347
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,609
-Did you really do it?
-Darn, I lost again.

348
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,612
You knew Su-yeong was dating Mr. Jeong.

349
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,908
And you knew who Sang-su liked.

350
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,745
-So?
-So how…

351
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,831
How could you do that?

352
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,962
Gyeong-pil, you're the worst…

353
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,883
both as a boyfriend and a friend.

354
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,970
You're not being honest with yourself.

355
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,770
Shouldn't you be happy right now?

356
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,401
You even came to me and said
you were having a rough time.

357
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,615
Sang-su and Su-yeong
can never be together now.

358
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,369
I'm just saying it's okay to be happy.

359
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,664
Are you saying you did this for me?

360
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,003
Of course not.

361
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,399
I heard you had
a position transfer interview.

362
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,193
-Yes.
-Did it go well?

363
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,613
Yes.

364
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,365
It went well?

365
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,409
Yes.

366
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,036
Did you know Mr. Jeong got fired?

367
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,000
You dated Mr. Jeong,
led on Sang-su, and slept with Gyeong-pil…

368
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,841
I really can't figure you out.

369
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,677
I liked you so much.

370
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,095
I never asked you to.

371
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,519
I never asked you…

372
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,898
to like me or understand me.

373
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,282
You said you'd keep liking me
to make me uncomfortable.

374
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,580
But I want
to feel comfortable for a change.

375
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,544
So go ahead and hate me.

376
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,506
Let me ask you one question.

377
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,971
What on earth…

378
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,932
did Sang-su mean to you?

379
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,384
Why won't you ask me anything?

380
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,055
I know you're curious.

381
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,516
I know you're angry
and that you despise me.

382
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,602
Everyone's bad-mouthing me
and wants answers,

383
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,646
but why aren't you the least bit curious?

384
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,766
Why are you here?

385
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,106
You wondered why I wouldn't ask anything.

386
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,363
I was afraid.

387
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,371
It didn't matter if it was true or not.

388
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,959
I was afraid you'd use that as an excuse

389
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,087
to keep your distance from me.

390
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,055
What I'm afraid of the most…

391
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,853
is not seeing you, Su-yeong.

392
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,242
Don't come here anymore.

393
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,995
I'm going to come tomorrow.

394
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,498
And I'll keep coming.

395
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,462
I'm going to face you while I suffer.

396
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,800
So I'll see you…

397
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,930
tomorrow.

398
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,510
SU-YEONG

399
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,346
We're now departing.
Please board the bus for Miryang.

400
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,326
Hey, Sang-su.

401
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,503
Weren't you going on a trip?

402
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,548
Your door is unlocked too.
What's with the mess?

403
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,342
If I say I'm on a trip,
people won't bother me.

404
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,554
And there's nothing to steal,
so I don't need to lock it.

405
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,476
People heard our marriage fell through
right after the wedding,

406
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,519
so the realtor can't list this place.

407
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,149
Have you eaten anything?

408
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,362
Does it look like I have an appetite?

409
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,751
-Do you want more?
-I have no appetite.

410
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,384
Do you want to hear something strange?

411
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,763
After the divorce,

412
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,018
I thought I could be with Jeong-eun
and pick up where we left off.

413
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,648
But?

414
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,401
My wife…

415
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,155
Well, she's not my wife anymore.

416
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,161
I keep thinking of Ji-eun
because I feel bad for her.

417
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,839
But then, I can't leave Jeong-eun again.

418
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,392
Sang-su.

419
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,312
Love feels like

420
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,901
some kind of punishment
for something I did wrong.

421
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,331
That must be him. Can you get the door?

422
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,295
Hey, what took you so long…

423
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,148
Su-yeong.

424
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,779
Can you give me something to eat?

425
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,284
I'm hungry.

426
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,336
Here.

427
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,927
Slow down, or you'll get sick.

428
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,265
How are you feeling?

429
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,686
Your dad won't let me do anything.

430
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,362
Is there something going on?

431
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,912
There's always something going on.

432
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,673
What's the matter? You look worn out.

433
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,761
Mom.

434
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,432
What does it feel like to forgive someone?

435
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,733
Dad left you for someone else.

436
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,153
But you forgave him.

437
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,243
I want to know
what went through your mind.

438
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,544
Su-yeong…

439
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,555
Should we go back to Tongyeong?

440
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,064
You came here because of me.

441
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,196
Should we just
leave everything behind and go back?

442
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,658
What's going on?

443
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,453
You can tell me.

444
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,292
I'm tired.

445
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,757
I'm just tired.

446
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,426
Mom, I need some water.

447
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:29,628
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're the one who wanted to talk.

448
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,589
I don't believe you.

449
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,928
No matter how many times
you tell me that it happened…

450
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,931
I don't believe you.

451
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,057
Actually, no.

452
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,519
Even if it did happen…

453
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,855
I still like her.

454
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,653
Jeez.

455
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,031
That's some profound love.

456
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,453
You're capable of being
that understanding?

457
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,913
Is that…

458
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,833
what it looks like to you?

459
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,003
Does it look like I'm not angry?

460
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,508
I don't understand any of this,
and I really want to kill you.

461
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,138
But I don't believe it. I'm not buying it.

462
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,687
It doesn't feel real.

463
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,281
Do you need a reality check?

464
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,494
You would've been done for
if it hadn't been for me, you punk.

465
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,750
If you dump Mi-gyeong for Su-yeong,
do you think people will congratulate you?

466
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,504
Do you know what Mi-gyeong's dad is like?

467
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,797
He won't let this slide.

468
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,427
That's the reason?

469
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,097
You did it for me?

470
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,394
Hey.

471
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,692
Tell me the real reason.
Why did you take things this far?

472
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:20,155
What do you want?
Oh, do you want to talk about Mi-gyeong?

473
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:33,001
You want me to have a good reason.
That way, you'd feel better, right?

474
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,130
If I had gotten rid of Mi-gyeong for you,

475
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,633
you could've gone
to Su-yeong quite happily.

476
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,386
Sorry to disappoint you,

477
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,558
but there's no philosophical reason
as to why I sleep with women.

478
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,517
You bastard.

479
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,937
Su-yeong is the one who called me first.

480
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:01,196
I know you don't want to admit
the woman whom you love so much

481
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,031
only amounts to this.

482
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,157
But Sang-su…

483
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,536
you need to get yourself together.

484
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,703
Jong-hyeon, I know you can do it.

485
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,788
I believe in you. You got this!

486
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,202
Don't come here anymore.

487
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,747
I'm going to come tomorrow.

488
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,802
And I'll keep coming.

489
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,930
I'm going to face you while I suffer.

490
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,851
So I'll see you…

491
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,106
tomorrow.

492
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,488
I can't come next week.

493
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,783
Why not? We see each other
only once a week.

494
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,245
He's right. You need to come.

495
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,664
I'm a bit busy.

496
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,707
I hear the bank is having issues.

497
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,876
And there's a dirty rumor going around.

498
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,671
Hyeok-jin says it's your branch.

499
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,551
But it has nothing to do with Mi-gyeong.

500
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,760
I never said it did.

501
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,306
Anyway, why hasn't Sang-su called?

502
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,310
Since he turned down dinner,
he should be the one to contact me first.

503
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:27,068
It's a busy season for bank clerks.
He'll call when things settle down.

504
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,499
What are you going to do?

505
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,295
-About what?
-About Sang-su!

506
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,547
Do you still plan on staying with him?

507
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,550
He told me straight to my face
that he doesn't want you.

508
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,972
He's involved with that woman
in the video, too, isn't he?

509
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,892
I have a sixth sense for things like this.

510
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,269
Don't say a word to Dad.

511
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,564
Where's your pride?

512
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,482
Mom.

513
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,608
What?

514
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,112
This is my pride.

515
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,300
Are you eating well these days?

516
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,056
You sound like such a typical mom.

517
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,434
I am your mom.

518
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,731
I thought you were my brother.

519
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,609
Goodness.

520
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,535
Sang-su.

521
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,290
Don't get hurt too badly.

522
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,464
It's okay to feel desperate,
confused, and troubled.

523
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,049
All of that is okay.

524
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,220
Just don't hurt too badly.

525
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,769
Wounds to your heart tend to last long.

526
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,496
Take some facial masks.
You look terrible.

527
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,596
-Hello.
-Hello.

528
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,016
What happened?

529
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,768
I called, but then a nurse picked up.

530
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,103
I just got here too.

531
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,567
Is Mi-gyeong all right?

532
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,778
Don't worry. This happens once in a while.

533
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,115
She doesn't want her parents to know.

534
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,829
Please stay with her
until she's done getting her IV.

535
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,831
Okay.

536
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,341
Actually, is something going on
with Mi-gyeong?

537
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,220
This happens
when she's particularly stressed.

538
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,229
By any chance,
is there a problem between the two of you?

539
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,210
Why are you here?

540
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,419
Just lie down.

541
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:19,300
It's nothing. This happens sometimes.
Excuse me, can you take this out?

542
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,302
No, you should finish it.

543
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,388
Please take it out.

544
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,624
Let's go to your place.

545
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,776
Shouldn't you eat porridge instead?

546
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,572
I thought…

547
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,077
I could eat this.

548
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,267
You look distressed.

549
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,441
A little.

550
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:14,957
I'm sorry…

551
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,378
for causing you pain.

552
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,508
I think…

553
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,470
I was…

554
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,891
disrespectful to you…

555
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:37,188
back then at Han River.

556
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:47,156
When you said it was okay
that I wasn't 100% ready yet…

557
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,912
I used that as an excuse.

558
01:03:55,915 --> 01:04:00,461
Anybody can see
that you're a wonderful person.

559
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,548
And your background was…

560
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,593
a little too much to handle at times.

561
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:12,473
But despite that background,
you grew up to be a great person…

562
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,145
and I thought
it wouldn't hurt to be with you.

563
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,442
I had some pretentious thoughts like that.

564
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,450
I took advantage of your feelings…

565
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,872
for selfish purposes.

566
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:51,929
I knew I didn't like you
as much as you wanted me to.

567
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,307
But I thought that someday…

568
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,936
it would reach 100%.

569
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,072
That's how I deceived…

570
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,285
you…

571
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,623
and me.

572
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,889
I'm sorry. I mean it.

573
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,538
Mi-gyeong.

574
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,627
Yes?

575
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,136
I don't want you to hurt because of me.

576
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,935
Please don't be hurt, Mi-gyeong.

577
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:22,853
Okay?

578
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,120
The ramyeon is cold now.

579
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,126
I'm going to leave now.

580
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,183
Let me take you.

581
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,770
It's okay.

582
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:13,904
I can take this car.

583
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,587
Bye.

584
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,479
What are you doing?
Why are you dumping these?

585
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,608
I have to make money.
I'm giving up everything to work.

586
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,486
-This has nothing to do with our breakup!
-Why do you care?

587
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,198
Why do you care
if I take that exam or not?

588
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,044
What…

589
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,838
What happened to us?

590
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,144
Why did you do that?

591
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,731
Because I was poor?
Because I had no future?

592
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:22,611
You said you trusted I'd do well,
but did you lose hope in me?

593
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,280
No, it's not that.

594
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,284
It is. I was pathetic.
That's why you did this.

595
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:34,331
Then why did you want to stay together?
Why did you say I could move in with you?

596
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:43,007
You never loved me, did you?

597
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:45,759
Be honest.

598
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,804
It was pity, right?

599
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,225
You felt sorry for me.

600
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,854
Sympathy. Compassion.

601
01:11:58,188 --> 01:11:59,857
Something like that, right?

602
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,616
Were you happy when you were with me?

603
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:18,417
You always said things were fine,
but were you really happy?

604
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,673
You never looked happy
when you were with me.

605
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,176
You laughed more
when you were with other people.

606
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,099
Are you talking about Seon-jae?
There's nothing between us.

607
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,435
I know that. It's not because of her.

608
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,439
It's just…

609
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,943
It's just that our love came to an end.

610
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:57,623
And what you felt for me
wasn't love either.

611
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,796
No, that's not true.

612
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,050
Don't use me as an excuse.
Don't you dare assume anything.

613
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,386
I'm sorry, Jong-hyeon.

614
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,304
I'm sorry.

615
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:14,640
I'm sorry.

616
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,112
Let me ask you one last time.

617
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,533
Is it true?

618
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,789
Did you really sleep with him?

619
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,253
Yes.

620
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,841
Yes.

621
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,266
You're…

622
01:13:58,183 --> 01:13:59,852
a real bitch.

623
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,245
I think that's enough to fool him.

624
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,463
Should we stop now?

625
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,049
Yes.

626
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,307
Why go this far?

627
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:47,024
Why did you offer to help, Mr. So?

628
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,407
Was the person you liked in college…

629
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,786
Ms. Park?

630
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:13,217
You're offering to help
because she's stressed out by me.

631
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,974
Well, does it matter?

632
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,194
I needed that too.

633
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,040
An irrevocable reason.

634
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,572
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

635
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:19,092
Do you think it'll work out between us?

636
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,927
I can handle anything that comes my way.

637
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:22,888
No matter what it is.

638
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,931
I wasn't going to come.

639
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,683
But I still came because this could be…

640
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,352
our last time seeing each other.

641
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,937
Let's decide with this coin.

642
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,231
Thank you, Sang-su.

643
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,027
Can you promise me one thing?

644
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,489
Promise me that
you won't give up on the exam.

645
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,242
What did you want to tell me?

646
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,661
That I liked you.

647
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,537
That I wanted to ask you out.

648
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,083
I'm going to put my feelings…

649
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,752
and happiness first.

650
01:17:55,545 --> 01:18:00,550
