THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,428
Cheers!

3
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,730
This is nice.

4
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,441
Why aren't you drinking?

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,943
Who's going to drive?

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,279
We can hire a designated driver.

7
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,990
No, it's okay. You go ahead and drink.

8
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,249
What?

9
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm looking at my boyfriend,
wondering why he said he'd date me.

10
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,345
You said that's how I'd get this.

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
Seriously?

12
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,353
You say you like me so much now,

13
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,314
but you couldn't
care less about me back in college.

14
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,903
So whom did you give
your heart to instead?

15
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,949
The timing was off back then.

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,785
I had graduated by the time
you came back to school.

17
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,623
What about you?
Were you really single that whole time?

18
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,707
Not even a crush?

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:14,551
No, don't tell me. I'm already
starting to get jealous. Forget it.

20
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,686
Su-yeong. Let's break up.

21
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,206
Help me understand you.

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,961
You took a leave of absence
and didn't answer my calls.

23
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,754
Then you suddenly showed up, and…

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,093
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,389
You can apologize later.
Give me an explanation first.

26
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,729
Jong-hyeon.

27
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,119
By any chance…

28
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,543
did you do badly on the test?

29
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,674
Is it your studies?

30
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,969
Is that why?

31
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,016
Yes.

32
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,562
But still…

33
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,825
-I have to go.
-How can you leave after this?

35
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,577
Later.

36
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,288
Let's talk again later.

37
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,252
Goodbye.

38
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,128
What is it?

39
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,591
I think it's amazing
that we're in a relationship now.

40
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,553
Right?

41
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,599
When I first saw you,
I never imagined we'd end up like this.

42
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,144
I did.

43
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,605
I went to the future and saw us.

44
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,859
What else did you see?

45
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,449
You got promoted and began to work at HQ.

46
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,286
And I passed the test
and became a police officer.

47
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,705
Also…

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,834
we took walks whenever it rained.

49
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,631
Were we still dating when you saw us?

50
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,302
Yes, and breaking up
never crossed our minds.

51
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,411
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

52
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,538
EPISODE 7

53
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,518
-Hey.
-When will you get here?

54
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,812
By the way, I'm already here.

55
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,564
Right, I'm almost there.

56
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,079
Hey, you're here.

57
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,957
-Make me a cup too.
-Get it yourself.

58
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,793
-Good morning.
-Hey, Ms. Park.

59
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,837
Did something good happen?

60
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,421
Can you tell?

61
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,801
What is it? Come on,
let me live vicariously through you.

62
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,264
Actually, something good
happened to Mr. Noh.

63
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,855
It's definitely different.

64
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,276
BRANCH MANAGER
YUK SI-GYEONG

65
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,283
Now then. Let's have another good day.

66
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,875
Good morning, Mr. Branch Manager.

67
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,503
What did you say? Who?

68
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,467
Goodness, I just slipped up.

69
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,888
For a second there,
you looked like a real branch manager, so…

70
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,935
That's quite understandable,
but let's be careful.

71
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,813
Yes, sir.

72
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,319
Blue Mountain coffee with
two-and-a-quarter pumps of syrup, right?

73
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,362
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

74
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,034
You must be stressed.

75
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,286
Yes, right.

76
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,546
-These have to be signed.
-Is that so?

77
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,508
Let's see.

78
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,262
When will you do the site inspection?

79
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,182
As soon as the paperwork is done, sir.

80
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,266
I see.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,437
-Can you press a bit harder?
-Yes, sir.

82
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,273
I almost forgot.

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,192
-This weekend…
-Yes?

84
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,069
Why don't we go hiking?

85
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,406
I'm sorry. Did you say hiking?

86
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,702
Why not?
Golfing is okay, but hiking isn't?

87
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,872
Wait, I got chills.

88
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,669
I was just thinking
that I should go hiking this weekend

89
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,505
because I got a sudden urge to go.

90
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:12,343
Mr. Branch Manager, I've been thinking for
a while that you and I are like soulmates…

91
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,469
Goodness.

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
You're doing it again.

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,016
I'm only filling in for Mr. Yuk
while he's away on vacation.

94
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,894
-I'm just borrowing his office.
-I'm sorry.

95
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,437
-So watch what you say.
-Yes.

96
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,731
-Manager Ma.
-I'm still an assistant manager.

97
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,400
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

98
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,443
-I slipped up too.
-It's all right, sir.

99
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,028
Okay, then.

100
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,031
I'm all right, really.

101
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,577
This Sunday, we'll meet at the entrance
to Cheonggyesan Mountain.

102
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,620
Please get there by 10:00 a.m. sharp.

103
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,249
We'll take a group photo at the top,
come down, and go home.

104
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,334
But it'd be a shame to go straight home,

105
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:50,172
so we'll go to a good restaurant nearby
and have some fun while sharing a meal.

106
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,509
Is hiking the new trend now?

107
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,303
A sudden urge to go hiking?

108
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,139
What did you say again?
That you two are soulmates?

109
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,807
You sly punk.

110
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,351
You're all coming, right?

111
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,519
Mr. Lee?

112
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,855
No idea. We'll see.

113
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,815
Pending.

114
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,652
It's my in-laws' wedding anniversary.

115
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,904
I have a blind date.

116
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,072
That's a lie.

117
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,574
It's my cousin's wedding.

118
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,618
A wedding?

119
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,952
What about you, Ms. Ahn?

120
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,079
I'll go.

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,373
Okay. Ms. Ahn is coming.

122
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,669
Mr. Ha, you're definitely coming.

123
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,047
-I'll go too.
-Okay.

124
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,007
Ms. Park is coming.

125
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,345
I have a memorial service to attend.
As the eldest son, I must be there.

126
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,264
I'm getting a suit to wear
to meet my future in-laws.

127
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,310
I see. I got it for now.
Tell me if you change your mind.

128
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,439
Hello.

129
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,316
-Hello.
-Hello.

130
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,442
Hello.

131
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,570
It seems like Mr. Jeong is still on leave.

132
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,089
Wait, Ms. Ahn.

133
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,256
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,718
I'll clean it up.

135
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,553
No, it's okay. I got it.

136
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,437
Shall we get going, then?

137
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,523
Sorry?

138
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,943
We're going to Yeongjin Products today.

139
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,405
Right.

140
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,574
Let me just get changed quickly.

141
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,575
I'll take that.

142
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,952
Thank you.

143
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,164
LOCKER ROOM

144
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,633
Uncomfortable, right?

145
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,637
Sorry?

146
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,682
I meant the car. It's small.

147
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,979
No, it's all right.

148
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,873
Your annual income surpasses
the standard amount,

149
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:34,420
and you've been employed here long enough,
so you can borrow up to this amount.

150
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,338
Do you have the paperwork ready?

151
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,631
Yes.

152
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:42,470
Automatic payroll deposit to this account
will give you regular benefits.

153
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,723
Could you fill in the blanks I checked?

154
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,288
Is that your lunch?

155
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,708
No. I'll eat with Sang-su
when he gets back.

156
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,336
He's going to eat with me.

157
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,424
-Did you two make plans?
-No, but I'm about to ask him.

158
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,517
PARK MI-GYEONG

159
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,109
Hey.

160
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,535
I can hear you fine.
We're done now and heading back.

161
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,538
I'm craving something today.

162
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,291
Really? Then ask Su-yeong to join us.

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,461
I'll ask Gyeong-pil too.

164
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,465
Okay. I'll meet you there.

165
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,676
Come quickly.

166
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,515
You heard that, right?
You're having lunch with us.

167
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,519
Looks like you two have become close.

168
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,855
Is that a problem?

169
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,693
No, I was just making an observation.

170
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,946
Get ready and come.

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,872
Was that Ms. Park?

172
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,124
Yes.

173
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,169
She wants to have lunch together,
including you and Mr. So.

174
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,675
But if you feel uncomfortable,
then you don't have to come.

175
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,804
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

176
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,269
So where are we going?

177
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,192
The four of us haven't had lunch before.

178
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,152
You're right.

179
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,712
Sang-su, did we eat
oyster gukbap last time?

180
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,924
The siraegi soup is also delicious.

181
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
What is it? Do you not like oysters?

182
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,889
No, I do.

183
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,894
-How about we try siraegi soup today?
-Sure.

184
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,562
Is that okay with you?

185
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,521
Sure.

186
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,279
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

187
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,369
Here, I'll take that.

188
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,667
Thank you.

189
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,383
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

190
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

191
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,733
I wanted to eat first.

192
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,152
Sure.

193
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,116
You never ate this in college.

194
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,743
Me?

195
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,122
No, I actually like perilla powder.

196
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,880
Does it taste all right?

197
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,883
Yes.

198
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,934
Mr. Jeong has been
on vacation for a while.

199
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,230
Is something going on?

200
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,405
You're as nosy as ever, aren't you?
Call him yourself if you're so curious.

201
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,250
What's wrong? Indigestion?

202
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,586
Yes, a bit.

203
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,215
I wonder why you have indigestion.

204
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,719
Well, that was unexpected.

205
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,304
What do you mean?

206
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,514
You and Mi-gyeong dating.

207
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,021
-How did you know?
-I didn't.

208
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,148
Until you told me just now.

209
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,736
Well, I've known you for a while,
so it was obvious.

210
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,827
So does Mi-gyeong know?

211
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,581
-What?
-That you liked Ms. Ahn.

212
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,463
Well, even if she knew,
she wouldn't have backed off.

213
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,635
Yes, sir. Yes.

214
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,137
You're already here?
I'm right around the corner.

215
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,015
Yes, I'll be there soon. Yes, sir.

216
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,312
Good luck. You have my support.

217
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,658
Where's Gyeong-pil? Did he leave?

218
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
Yes. He went to the singing class.

219
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Here.

220
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,085
It's just a little something.
You seemed to enjoy it a lot.

221
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,628
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

222
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,630
-How much is it?
-No.

223
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,383
It's not a big deal. Please accept it.

224
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,886
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

225
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,263
-Thank you.
-Come again.

226
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,434
She won't make any profit
because she gave us so much.

227
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,770
Sang-su, let's come again.

228
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,188
Okay.

229
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,609
I'm going to head back.
You two should take your time.

230
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,448
Maybe she's going to call Mr. Jeong.

231
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,036
-We should go too.
-Okay.

232
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,374
This looks great, doesn't it?

233
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,224
Jong-hyeon. We need to talk.

234
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,367
The weather forecast says it might rain.

235
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,204
Should we go later?

236
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:10,417
Come on. When it rains, it rains.
Let's just go. I like it when it rains.

237
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,483
I want to like the things that you like.

238
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,028
And I hope you'll like
the things that I like.

239
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,210
Sang-su, the light is green.

240
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,253
Right.

241
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,283
Happy?

242
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,953
Why? Don't you like it?

243
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,378
For someone who disapproves of this,
you sure do have nice gear.

244
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,755
It's because you said you like this.

245
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,008
Jeez.

246
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,804
Anyway, do we have to sit here
and watch oxygen burn?

247
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,767
This is the beginning of civilization
and the fruit of human prosperity.

248
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,148
Human prosperity came from reproduction.

249
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,859
You need to light a fire
under reproduction for history to begin.

250
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,821
And when will history begin
if we just sit around and watch this fire?

251
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,288
How about a sweet potato?

252
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,540
Sure. Peel one for me.

253
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,839
Gosh, that's hot.

254
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,217
So are you really going to go hiking?

255
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,178
Of course.

256
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,182
Won't it be tough?
You won't get any rest this weekend.

257
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,143
But you're going.

258
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,897
You'll be really tired.

259
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,736
I can't let my boyfriend face death alone.

260
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,908
Besides, I'm in much
better shape than you.

261
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,453
Just try not to crash
to the ground like you did last time.

262
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,506
If I fall down, will you ask me out again?

263
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,591
Here. Take this and eat it.

264
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,885
My gosh.

265
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
Be careful.

266
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,264
Gosh, this is so hot!

267
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,101
Wait, did you peel this
with your bare hands?

268
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,437
It must've been so hot.

269
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,815
It was super-hot.

270
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,152
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm fine. Eat up.

271
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,946
Thanks.

272
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,097
What's going on?

273
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,980
Jong-hyeon, are you moving?

274
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,863
You still refuse to talk to me?

275
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,660
Are you even listening to me?

276
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,581
Yes, I'm moving out.
And I'll quit the bank tomorrow.

277
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,834
Why?

278
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,050
I knew your studies were an excuse,
but I went along with it

279
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,343
to give you time.

280
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,764
So why are you
stabbing me in the back like this?

281
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,935
If you quit your job and move,
am I just supposed to accept that?

282
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,355
Am I just supposed to say, "Yes."
And break up with you?

283
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,693
Are you sick of me already?

284
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,155
Did I not meet your expectations?

285
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
Did I fail to take a hint?

286
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,159
-Should I have just left you?
-My father…

287
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,666
My father collapsed.

288
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,895
Jong-hyeon…

289
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,691
Here, take this.

290
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,695
Please make the first payment
at administration.

291
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,992
Do you know how awful it was?

292
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,287
I was more worried about money…

293
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,247
BILLING STATEMENT

294
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,749
… than to be happy
that my father was okay.

295
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,510
I thought I was at zero.

296
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,682
I thought all I had to do was
build my way up from zero.

297
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,892
But I was wrong.

298
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,939
Starting at zero
was more than I could hope for.

299
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,984
My life actually started below zero.

300
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,407
How was I supposed
to tell you this, Su-yeong?

301
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,578
Where are you moving to?

302
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,289
Wherever.

303
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,005
Please leave. I need to pack.

304
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,513
Don't quit your job just yet.

305
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,811
You should think about it
until your leave is over.

306
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,833
How may I help you, ma'am?

307
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,546
Is Assistant Manager Park Mi-gyeong here?

308
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,173
Are you one of our VIP clients?

309
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,884
I'm a VIP, all right.

310
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,679
Please come in. Let me escort you.

311
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,063
-Please wait in here.
-Thank you.

312
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,732
Have a nice day.

313
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,904
He has great taste in ties.

314
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,614
Please sign here.

315
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,325
-Here?
-Yes.

316
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,830
So where's that young lady
who came to our house before?

317
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,874
Su-yeong is with the Deposits Team.

318
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,627
Then did you just take credit
for everything she did?

319
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,089
It was my job to begin with.

320
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,801
Shall we have lunch?

321
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,346
No, I'm meeting my new bestie.

322
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,599
You two seem close.

323
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,353
Share this with everyone here.

324
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,147
And these are your vitamins.

325
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,858
You never take vitamins
unless I bring them to you.

326
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,985
I said I was fine.

327
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,905
These are really good for you, though.

328
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,072
How good?

329
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,617
This is a multivitamin from Switzerland,

330
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,202
and it's top-of-the-line.

331
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:52,415
Vitamin A, B, C, D,
folic acid, calcium, and magnesium.

332
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,376
Anyway, everything in it is good.

333
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,423
I'll take it then.

334
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,010
But only because I said
it's top-of-the-line.

335
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,972
Then I'll contact you
once the screening process is over.

336
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,808
Yes, thank you.

337
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,650
Emergency stairwell. Now.

338
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,498
What is it? Is something wrong?

339
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,542
Take this. They're vitamins.

340
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,210
Do you want to take one now?

341
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,795
I'm okay. You should take it.

342
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,631
This is really good for you.

343
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,260
It's a multivitamin
imported directly from Switzerland.

344
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,389
It has vitamin A, B, C, D,
folic acid, calcium, and magnesium.

345
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,350
Whatever. Everything in it is good.

346
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,602
So just be grateful.

347
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,606
I'll live a long life thanks to you.

348
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,527
You helped cure my disease,
so I'm returning the favor.

349
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,280
What? Are you sick?

350
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,448
Yes, I am.

351
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,491
What is it?

352
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,368
Monday blues.

353
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,709
I would get really depressed on Sundays.

354
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,627
Actually,

355
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,047
I'd want to get off work badly
even though it was only Saturday.

356
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:31,139
But now, I want to come to work
every single day just to see you.

357
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,935
Aren't you embarrassed to say such things?

358
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,439
Not at all. I can take it even further.

359
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,234
So? Do you want me to go on?

360
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,319
Do you?

361
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,576
There's absolutely no use
in raising a daughter.

362
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,372
She won't hang out with me now,
so imagine if she starts dating.

363
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,919
I'll make sure
to keep my eye on her boyfriend.

364
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,088
If she takes after you,
then she'll bring home a good man.

365
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,548
Right.

366
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,260
My daughter takes after me,
so she has very high standards.

367
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,766
How old is your son again?
Is he dating anyone?

368
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,477
I have no idea because I don't ask.

369
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,023
Let me give you
a piece of advice as a friend.

370
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,109
Don't ever accept a daughter-in-law
if she's like my kid.

371
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,111
Why not?

372
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,739
I only live with her because she's mine.

373
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,908
But to have her as a daughter-in-law?

374
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,285
Gosh, you won't find
anyone bossier than her.

375
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,747
I'll be happy as long as
he's happy with whomever.

376
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,625
I hope he'll start dating.

377
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,835
Dating is great when you're young.

378
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,506
But now, I realize
that having a husband or child is useless.

379
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,759
My life is much better
with a friend who is willing to listen.

380
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,054
Thank you, Ms. Han.

381
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,123
Are you here to quit?

382
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,293
I told you yesterday.

383
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,006
We need to talk.

384
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,804
Do you have to take extreme measures?

385
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:41,436
I get that your situation is difficult.
But you don't have to quit your job.

386
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,313
Your father will recover
after he gets surgery.

387
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,775
-And if you pass your test--
-I failed the test too.

388
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,993
Being a security guard doesn't pay a lot.

389
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,998
I wanted to do it while I studied,
but there's no need to do that now.

390
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,545
What about me?

391
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,093
Why are you giving up on me?

392
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,765
I get that you're quitting
because of money,

393
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,767
but why are you breaking up with me?

394
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,484
You're the same to me,
no matter what situation you're in.

395
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,402
No. It's different.

396
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,865
If I were a part-time security guard
with no future ahead of him,

397
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,285
could I have met someone like you?

398
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:53,800
I failed the test,
and my family's worse off now than before.

399
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,973
Su-yeong.

400
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,143
I want to break up
because I feel humiliated.

401
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,980
Because you saw this side of me.

402
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,525
And because this is all I am.

403
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,070
It's humiliating that you saw everything.

404
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,575
But whenever I see you…

405
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,579
I forget my place and keep wanting you.

406
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,337
It's tough for me.

407
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,880
Then what should I do?

408
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,817
Should I just break up with you then?

409
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,280
Is that what you really want?
Is it that easy for you?

410
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,907
Who said it was easy?

411
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,785
It's hard.
It's not like I want to do this.

412
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,455
What should I do?
I don't know when things will get better.

413
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,291
-Should I hold on to you?
-Do it.

414
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,087
Ask me to wait. Hold on to me.

415
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,016
I'll quit my job once my leave is over.

416
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,895
If that'll make you feel better,

417
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,439
then I'll do that.

418
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,109
-Please take care of this.
-Okay.

419
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,781
Su-yeong, are you done? Shall we go?

420
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,532
I'm almost done.

421
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,507
Let's go to Cheonggyesan together.

422
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,134
I can take the bus.

423
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,054
You live right across the bridge from me.

424
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,889
We can chat on the way.

425
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,183
Okay.

426
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,436
Text me your address.
I'll pick you up in the morning.

427
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,146
Okay.

428
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,401
Guess what? I'm dating Sang-su.

429
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:04,657
I thought you should know
since you told me about Mr. Jeong too.

430
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,288
Congratulations.

431
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
It's like a piece of a puzzle.

432
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,504
It feels as if I've finally found
the last puzzle piece

433
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,506
missing from my life.

434
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,929
Are you that happy?

435
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,391
Of course. It's wonderful.

436
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,687
It's exactly how I imagined it.

437
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,261
Are you getting in or not?

438
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,889
I'm coming.

439
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,936
Numbers can tell you many things.

440
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,606
Here's your ID, sir.

441
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,732
Okay. Thank you.

442
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,984
ACCOUNT BALANCE

443
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,027
One's wealth.

444
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,575
Social standing.

445
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,205
One's full potential.

446
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,125
CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE
POLICE OFFICER EXAM

447
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,941
BALANCE: 19,800 WON

448
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,901
Numbers help me realize…

449
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,823
that he has a rough future ahead of him.

450
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,707
That his situation
isn't something I can handle.

451
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,264
Sang-su.

452
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,434
-Good morning.
-Hey, you're here.

453
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,478
Are those sneakers?

454
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,314
-Will your ankle be okay?
-I'll be fine.

455
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,692
You might really sprain your ankle.

456
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,777
How did you know I was going for that?

457
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,863
What?

458
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,490
If I sprain my ankle,
you'll have to carry me.

459
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,412
Hop in.

460
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,582
Sang-su, let's take my car.
You can leave yours here.

461
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,507
She lives closer than I thought.
We'll be there soon.

462
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,388
But does she know that I'm coming?

463
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,475
No, but she knows that we're dating.

464
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,767
I told her.

465
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,354
She told me
that she was dating Mr. Jeong too.

466
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,772
Is that okay?

467
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,276
Yes, that's fine.

468
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,241
-What did she say?
-What? What do you mean?

469
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,662
When you told her that we were dating,

470
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,290
what did Ms. Ahn say?

471
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,836
She congratulated me
and said that we made a cute couple.

472
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,263
Su-yeong, hop in the back.
Sang-su is here too.

473
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,060
Hello.

474
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,280
Let's go.

475
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,496
Right, I got some chocolate.

476
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,844
Isn't this good?
I ordered it from this popular place.

477
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,013
Yes, it's good.

478
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,349
Do you want one?

479
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,519
No, thank you.

480
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,773
It's like a piece of a puzzle.

481
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,318
It feels as if I've finally found
the last puzzle piece

482
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,320
missing from my life.

483
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,000
Do you think we'll be late?

484
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,129
-I think we'll be fine.
-Okay.

485
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,717
POLICE

486
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,928
Will you be doing that too?

487
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,890
You'll be the first person
I salute when I become an officer.

488
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,018
Promise?

489
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,478
Yes. I'll keep it at all costs.

490
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:35,362
And when you're having a rough day,
you can call me whenever you want.

491
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,619
I'm sorry, but I have to get out.

492
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,288
Su-yeong.

493
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,878
What's going on? Goodness.

494
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,061
I thought you all couldn't make it.

495
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,648
The wedding was called off.
The groom-to-be had an affair.

496
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,236
Goodness. No personal questions, please.

497
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:21,408
I thought this would be more fun
than attending a memorial service.

498
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,786
Well, I just came.

499
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,915
Don't ask. I'm about to get mad again.

500
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,918
But where's Su-yeong?

501
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,004
Something suddenly came up.

502
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,343
Mr. Noh was the one who wanted to come.
Why isn't he here yet?

503
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,762
Hey!

504
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,722
Good morning!

505
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,683
-Good morning.
-You're here.

506
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,435
I like how everyone is dressed.

507
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,647
KCU! Are you ready?

508
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,357
Yes!

509
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,733
Hey. Louder, please.

510
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,443
Are you ready?

511
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,320
-Yes.
-Yes!

512
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,155
Okay, let's go!

513
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,074
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

514
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,618
-Keep it up.
-Let's go.

515
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,578
He's so energetic.

516
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,788
Let's go.

517
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,337
Keep up the pace. Pass it on.

518
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,715
-Keep up the pace. Pass it on.
-Keep up the pace.

519
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,928
What is it? Are you tired?

520
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,430
No, I'm fine.

521
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,933
-Give me that.
-What? I'm fine, really.

522
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,153
-Here. Take this.
-What? Are you looking after me?

523
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,323
Wipe the spit off your chin.

524
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,908
You're so gross.

525
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,957
Wait.

526
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,377
You might as well lie down.

527
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,047
Oh, my. You're down.

528
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,970
Everyone is so fast.
Is this a hiking club?

529
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,307
Or maybe you're just that slow.
Have you thought about that?

530
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,351
This is it for me, Ms. Bae.
You should go ahead.

531
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:25,908
Ms. Bae. Wait for me. Ms. Bae.

532
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:54,186
Does Mr. Jeong Jong-hyeon live here?

533
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,248
I'll take that.

534
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,713
So you work with Jong-hyeon?

535
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,632
Yes.

536
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,553
Were you going somewhere?
I'm sorry for making you stay.

537
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,097
I was on my way to the hospital
to see my husband,

538
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,432
but it's only right
to greet a visitor properly.

539
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,983
Thank you.

540
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,278
Jong-hyeon told us

541
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,322
that the bank gave him a loan
for his father's surgery.

542
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,703
Yes.

543
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,498
If they let him borrow
such a huge amount of money,

544
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,293
it must mean
that Jong-hyeon is excellent at his job.

545
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,672
He is. The bank appreciates him very much.

546
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,716
Goodness.

547
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,177
My goodness.
I didn't even offer you anything.

548
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,763
We grew these apples.

549
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,141
They're not pretty, but they're organic.

550
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,684
You can eat the skin too.

551
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,936
Thank you very much.

552
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,482
I'm not just saying this
because he's my child,

553
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,484
but Jong-hyeon is very sweet.

554
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:31,575
You'd never know that he's my kid.
He's smart, kind, and good-looking.

555
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,620
He really is.

556
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,752
Goodness, your skin is so fair.
Even more so than this rice cake here.

557
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,465
Anyway, what brings you
all the way here from Seoul?

558
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,879
OIL CHANGE
CAR WASH SERVICE

559
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,689
Surprise.

560
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,483
How did you find me here?

561
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,530
How did you end up here?
What are you doing?

562
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,325
I used to work here, and they needed help.

563
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,286
I see.

564
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,547
I came to tell you something.

565
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,512
Jong-hyeon.

566
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,892
I'm…

567
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,735
I'm hungry.

568
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,408
All right, come and sit.

569
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,993
Hurry up and sit down.

570
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,871
Come and sit. You too, Sang-su.

571
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,207
Mr. So, stand there.
And you should sit there.

572
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,084
Okay.

573
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,838
Here we go.

574
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,467
Okay. Big smiles, everyone.

575
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,885
And don't blink.

576
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,721
One, two, three.

577
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,273
Wait. My scarf.

578
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,525
Is something missing?

579
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,278
My scarf. I had it just a moment ago.

580
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,321
Pink stripes?

581
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,157
I think that's…

582
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,119
Ms. Bae and I'll find the scarf
and come down. You go on ahead.

583
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,580
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

584
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,752
-Search your backpack again.
-But I had it on me.

585
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,088
Where did I see it last?

586
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,178
Sang-su, wait.

587
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,305
What is it? Do your feet hurt?

588
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,599
No, let's take a photo.

589
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,311
I'll take it for you.

590
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:50,482
What? I want to take one together.
Not a group photo. Just the two of us.

591
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,237
Hey, I don't really take selfies.

592
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,781
You'll take a lot from now on.

593
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,369
Get closer. Closer. Good.

594
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,120
Let me do it.

595
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,337
One.

596
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,549
One, two, three.

597
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,056
Are you hot?

598
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,684
Your face is red.

599
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,398
Right? I wonder why my face turned red.

600
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,362
Mi-gyeong. Why are you so bold?

601
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,447
Come here, Sang-su.

602
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,285
-Come here.
-No, why?

603
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,418
Are you okay?

604
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,766
My gosh. No way.

605
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,686
-Are you two…
-Dating?

606
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,480
Well…

607
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,112
Yes.

608
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,991
We're in a relationship.

609
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,912
Mr. Lee!

610
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,705
-Mr. Lee Gu-il!
-Wait for me!

611
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,333
-You're in a relationship?
-Mr. Lee!

612
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,918
A relationship?

613
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,672
He'll tell everyone now.

614
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,676
What can we do? They caught us already.

615
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,019
Congrats.

616
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,771
-My gosh.
-Thank you.

617
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,106
-Everyone, fill your glasses.
-Yes, sir.

618
00:53:55,815 --> 00:54:00,528
My dear Sang-su. I told you to work hard,
but you worked on something else.

619
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,655
My gosh.

620
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,993
I think you two look great together.

621
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,915
Hey, you should consider
getting married while you're at it.

622
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,377
If two bank clerks save up together,
they can buy a house in no time.

623
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,753
They don't have to.

624
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,465
Ms. Park already has a house
in the center of Gangnam.

625
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,968
Really?

626
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,471
How did you know that?

627
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,682
Most people here know.

628
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,809
Really?

629
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:35,730
Sang-su, once again, congratulations.
Be good to her, and don't let her go.

630
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,526
I had a feeling
since the day you two got together

631
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,820
to work on the in-house contest.

632
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:46,408
I told you. I'm friends with Cupid.
I can tell right away when I see a couple.

633
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,243
Right.

634
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,664
When Seok-hyeon gets married,
Ms. Park should receive the bouquet.

635
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,833
-Right?
-Stop teasing us now.

636
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,334
This is why we kept quiet.

637
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,502
-Really?
-Yes.

638
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,753
I see.

639
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,756
Hey, Mr. So-Nosy.

640
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,174
Why are you so quiet?

641
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,011
Right.

642
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,888
Congratulations, you two.

643
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,765
-This is great.
-Yes.

644
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,267
-Congrats.
-Good for you.

645
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,310
-Congratulations.
-This is nice.

646
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,645
They're an office couple.

647
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,956
You said you were hungry.

648
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,502
Why aren't you eating?

649
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:51,556
Why did you come so far to see me?

650
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,394
I'm not sure.

651
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,776
I don't know why I'm here,
considering how you just took off.

652
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,123
Should we go now?

653
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,714
After I sober up a little.

654
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,263
It's nice here.

655
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,517
You can swim here in the summer.

656
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,020
I did that when I was younger.

657
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,900
It's deeper than it looks,
so I used a swim tube.

658
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,779
That must have been cute.

659
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,490
Su-yeong.

660
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,912
You should go now.

661
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,336
Is your father doing well?

662
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:07,841
Yes.

663
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,177
How did you
take care of the hospital bills?

664
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,809
I used up my security deposit
and the savings I had.

665
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,775
Are you going to live here from now on?

666
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,652
No.

667
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,947
My mom thinks I still work at the bank.

668
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,285
The place I used to work at
has a room I can use.

669
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,038
They give tips
if you work the night shift.

670
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,709
I'll stay and work there
till I save enough for a place.

671
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,715
Are you really giving up
on the police exam?

672
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,304
It's not a matter of choice.

673
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,516
And that's why you're breaking up with me?

674
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,276
Are you sure you'll be okay?

675
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,323
I told you already.

676
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,658
I can't see you right now.

677
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,869
No, I meant your dream.

678
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,171
You wanted to be a police officer.
Are you okay with giving up that dream?

679
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,055
I have to be.

680
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,726
You said you saw my house.

681
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,192
Dreaming is a luxury that I can't afford.

682
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:58,368
Someone I know
can see five years into the future.

683
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,624
In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

684
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,210
It'll be unimaginable.

685
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,754
You don't care what others think of you.

686
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:13,174
You're an amazing man
who recognizes his own worth.

687
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,263
But despite all that,
I don't think I'm a fool.

688
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,599
It doesn't bother me
when people mistreat me.

689
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,187
I have a dream,
so I know things will get better.

690
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,740
Those words you gave me,
I'll let you borrow them.

691
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,203
In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

692
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:50,253
You said that things
will get better if you try harder.

693
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,343
This is for you.

694
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,262
BUS TICKET

695
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,893
You said your life started below zero.

696
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,897
No matter how hard you try,

697
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,026
it feels as though
you can't reach that zero mark.

698
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,863
I know that feeling quite well.

699
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,494
As if nobody will hold your hand…

700
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,623
That kind of loneliness.

701
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,423
But I'll hold your hand.

702
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,596
Come live with me.

703
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,852
Work at the bank
and study for the exam again.

704
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,314
You know that nothing will change

705
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,484
even if you manage
to find a way to make a living.

706
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,530
Don't give up on the exam.

707
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,533
And show me…

708
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,871
that it's possible
to become happy if you work hard.

709
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,344
I'll wait for you at the bus terminal.

710
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,556
If you don't come…

711
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,520
then let's just break up as you said.

712
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,276
I can't go with you.

713
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,323
Then that's it, I guess.

714
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,453
I'll get going then.

715
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,356
Sang-su, look. We look great, right?

716
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,358
Yes, we do.

717
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,989
I'm sorry you couldn't drink
because you had to drive.

718
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,991
And it was to celebrate us too.

719
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,159
It's all right.

720
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:33,124
You don't like it, do you?
That people found out about us.

721
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,797
I was being cautious.
People talk a lot at the bank.

722
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,426
-If everyone knows--
-It'll be awkward if we break up.

723
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,931
You're really straightforward, aren't you?

724
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:54,562
If you're worried about that,
then just don't break up with me.

725
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,358
Sang-su.

726
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,446
Let's not break up.

727
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,239
Okay?

728
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,888
Su-yeong, are you okay?
Is something the matter?

729
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,723
Call me when you see this.

730
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,731
The bus for Seoul
will leave in ten minutes.

731
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,875
Thanks, Sang-su.
I got here comfortably, thanks to you.

732
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,047
Here.

733
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,925
I didn't drink too much today.

734
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,178
You had more than a bottle. That's a lot.

735
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,264
You're so considerate.

736
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,558
When did you notice that and get this?

737
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,309
See you later.

738
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,522
Hey, Sang-su.

739
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,323
We're now departing.

740
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,923
TICKET GATE

741
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,342
Do you want to come up?

742
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,882
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

743
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,945
It's 1031. The passcode.

744
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,241
Why did you get up so early?

745
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,036
Jong-hyeon. Do you have a girlfriend?

746
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,957
You guys look great together like this.

747
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,419
You too. You suit each other.

748
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:16,592
Unlike what you think,
I'm not that nice of a person.

749
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:17,802
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

750
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,638
I'm sleeping over
at my friend's place tonight.

751
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,933
I'm not going home tonight.

752
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:33,359
