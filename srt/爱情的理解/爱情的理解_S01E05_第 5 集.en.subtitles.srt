THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,429
PARCEL

3
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
POST OFFICE

4
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
Did you send us money again?

5
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,907
Goodness. Why did you send so much?

6
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,825
You need money to eat too.

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,953
Dad, you've heard of KCU Bank, right?

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,040
Yes, I got a job there.

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm also moving out of the tiny studio
and into a really nice place.

10
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,799
It's better than the studio
because it's got everything.

11
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,383
Of course.

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,303
It comes with a gas stove
and a refrigerator.

13
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,471
It's fully furnished.

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,933
Dad, on top of that,

15
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,353
the view is amazing here.

16
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,396
You really need to see this too.

17
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,025
Come on. I'm doing fine.
There's no need to worry.

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,694
EPISODE 5

19
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,573
JEONG JONG-HYEON

20
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,707
You're the new guy, right?

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,251
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

22
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,378
-I'm Jeong Jong-hyeon.
-I'm Ma Du-sik.

23
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,297
Are you an aspiring actor?

24
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,759
No, I'm studying
to become a police officer.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,636
An aspiring civil servant then.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
-Hello.
-Hello.

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,725
Mr. Ma.

28
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,396
I have bad heartburn.
Get me some medicine.

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,689
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,069
Mr. Jeong, why don't you go instead?

31
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,615
-Sure, I'll--
-Don't go.

32
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,122
There's a hangover cure
on the second shelf in the locker room.

33
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,332
-Oh, that?
-Yes.

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,334
Is that what's on the shelf?

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,299
You must be the new security guard.

36
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,467
Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,094
My name is Ahn Su-yeong.

38
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,013
I'm Jeong Jong-hyeon.

39
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,606
SOJU

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,412
Do you live around here?

41
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,164
Hello.

42
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,917
I live nearby too. Up there.

43
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,088
Goodbye, then.

44
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,216
About that client who made a scene today…

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,095
The crosswalk light will change to red
whenever they try to cross the road.

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,348
Sorry?

47
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,101
It's frustrating to see
the light change from green to red

48
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,479
right before you're about to cross.

49
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,357
And they'll always miss the bus by a hair.

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,279
And spill red tteokbokki sauce
on their white outfit.

51
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
And another thing.

52
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,408
The exchange rate will drop
as soon as they exchange money.

53
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,411
Right, people get
really frustrated when that happens

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,705
even though
it doesn't make a big difference.

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,049
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

56
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,802
JEONG JONG-HYEON

57
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,351
Let me… ask you a question too.

58
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,272
If I…

59
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,650
If I had kept my promise…

60
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,696
that day at the hotel…

61
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,533
would you have dated me?

62
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,007
Actually…

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
I…

64
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,971
Hey, Sang-su!

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,767
Let's have a smoke.

66
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you close to Ms. Ahn?

67
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,009
Can you set him up with her?

68
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
He wants to start dating.

69
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,391
It's just that I'd like to have one last
exciting romance before I get married.

70
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm a pretty decent catch, no?

71
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,690
What is it? Is she seeing someone?

72
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,035
Really? Is she seeing someone?

73
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,062
Hello?

74
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

75
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,280
No, it's okay.

76
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,283
I had dinner.

77
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,141
What is it? Is she seeing someone?

78
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,727
JEONG JONG-HYEON

79
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,175
I've lost my mind. What am I doing?

80
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,105
KCU BANK

81
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,326
Why did you just go back in yesterday?

82
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,163
I saw you on the phone.

83
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,876
-So--
-About yesterday.

84
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
I'm sorry if I made you
feel uncomfortable.

85
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,218
I didn't feel uncomfortable.

86
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,313
Do you want to meet tonight for a bit?

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
Let's talk after we're done for the day.

88
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,364
Okay.

89
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,101
SANG-SU

90
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,395
Sang-su, call me
when you see this message.

91
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,453
Is that your lunch?

92
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,457
I think it's expired.

93
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,047
It expired yesterday,
so it should be fine.

94
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,674
You were like that in college too.

95
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,259
You're still the same.

96
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,264
Why do you keep speaking so formally?

97
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
I did?

98
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,853
Do I make you uncomfortable?

99
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,816
Talk comfortably.
I don't want things to be awkward.

100
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey.

101
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,531
Sang-su, I didn't know you were here.

102
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,449
Hey. Yes.

103
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,744
You didn't answer my calls
when you were there.

104
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,830
Sorry, I ended up
grabbing a drink afterward.

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,624
It must've been fun.

106
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,836
Those sessions are all the same.
Why? Did something happen?

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,048
Hyeon-a and Hyeong-su
from college are getting married.

108
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,383
You heard, right?

109
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,593
-Yes.
-Let's go there together.

110
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
Hi, Su-yeong.

111
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,266
Hello.

112
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,980
-Let's go to the wedding.
-Okay.

113
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,862
Su-yeong.

114
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
Sang-su seems weird, right?

115
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,162
I'm not sure.

116
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,956
It's because of me.

117
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,791
I told him that I liked him.

118
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,587
He probably feels awkward.
He's so bad at lying.

119
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,635
So are you two dating now?

120
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,471
Not yet.

121
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,099
Knowing him,
he's going to think about it a lot.

122
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,852
It's really difficult to date at work.

123
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,480
But I think I might have a chance.

124
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,740
Sang-su, drink this.

125
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,117
Right. Thank you.

126
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,661
Can you show me the files
that we talked about?

127
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,122
-Here they are.
-I see.

128
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,250
-All the information is here…
-I see.

129
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,715
The total is 123,780 won.

130
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,175
What? That can't be right.

131
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,181
When I counted it at home,
it was 125,780 won.

132
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,058
Would you like me to count it again then?

133
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,936
No, just give it to me.

134
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,566
My wife is alone at home.
Her dementia has gotten worse.

135
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,235
I feel really anxious when she's alone.

136
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,363
I see. Then please take this.

137
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,914
People who need help can use this device
to make emergency calls.

138
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,665
There's a GPS tracker inside, so…

139
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,128
You can find out where your wife is,

140
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,798
and if she calls for help,
you'll be notified immediately.

141
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,927
-I've never heard of this.
-We provide it for free.

142
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,430
I could help connect it
to your phone if you'd like.

143
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,855
The balance is correct.

144
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,732
Okay, let's call it a day.

145
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,109
-Good work.
-Great day.

146
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,070
-Great work today.
-Great day.

147
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,572
Ms. Ahn.

148
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,368
Come with me to meet Punggyeong Products.

149
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,496
Right now, sir?

150
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,915
You couldn't come
while you worked the PB shift.

151
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,334
You're back at your post,
so you should come.

152
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,711
Okay, sir.

153
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,672
Then get changed and come downstairs.

154
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,050
-Goodnight, sir.
-Keep up the good work.

155
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,060
We'll have to meet next time.

156
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,230
It's okay.

157
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,865
Here, let me take that.

158
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,075
-Thank you.
-Good job today.

159
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,253
Look at that.
Why does he always take Ms. Ahn with him?

160
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,796
Is there something going on?

161
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,424
Of course not.
What could possibly go on with them?

162
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,010
Did she look happy to go with him?

163
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,761
She could've just said no, then.

164
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,849
That's our Ms. Bae.
You can tell that she grew up sheltered.

165
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,436
You don't know how
command and discipline work, do you?

166
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,479
-I'm heading out.
-Goodbye.

167
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,648
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

168
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,318
Well, what Ms. Bae said isn't wrong.

169
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,945
Ms. Ahn probably gets something
in return for going.

170
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,033
If you're not going to help her,
then at least stop badmouthing her.

171
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,368
It only hurts the victim.

172
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,121
You're acting as if
you're Ms. Ahn's mother.

173
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,415
-You're so protective of her.
-I'm leaving.

174
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,459
Hey, wait up. Let's leave together.

175
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,336
I thought you had plans.

176
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,631
They got canceled. I'll join you.

177
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,049
-Okay.
-Let's go.

178
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,176
Here you go.

179
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,640
We'll continue to support you
in every way we can.

180
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,517
I can't do business alone
in this day and age.

181
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,354
I've come this far
because I have a trustworthy partner.

182
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
I see.

183
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,358
I checked your account earlier,

184
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,361
and you have some funds
that will mature in a few weeks.

185
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,864
May I suggest a good product
before they mature?

186
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,784
We recently put together
a product for VIPs…

187
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,040
I thought this was a casual dinner.

188
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,628
Gosh, of course.

189
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,591
It's just that Ms. Ahn
is very dedicated to her job.

190
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,110
Goodness. Allow me to pour you a drink.

191
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,571
Bank clerks are too business-oriented.

192
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,574
They only talk about what they want
in any given situation.

193
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,245
Business dealings stem
from personal relationships, you know.

194
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,914
I'm not like that, sir.

195
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,960
I can see disapproval
written all over her face.

196
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:50,467
She has a long way to go,
and she has a lot to learn.

197
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,013
Young people these days
are different than us.

198
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,724
-What?
-What?

199
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,103
I'm getting married.
The parents are meeting this month.

200
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,022
Is it a shotgun wedding?

201
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,401
How can you get married? You just met her.

202
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,986
Marry first, date later.

203
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,114
Guys, my outlook on life has changed.

204
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,074
Think about it. Our ancestors

205
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,785
met their spouse
on their wedding day but lived well.

206
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,954
Getting married
to a suitable partner first

207
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,456
is a system proven by history.

208
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,623
It's not the Joseon era.

209
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,752
There was a higher birthrate
and lower divorce rate back then.

210
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,837
Are you sure about this?

211
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,255
You won't regret it?

212
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,631
Do you know what's funny?

213
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,218
I hesitated a lot
until the moment I made my decision.

214
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,264
But as soon as I decided,
it was really easy to move on.

215
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,142
Will I regret this decision?
I guess it's possible.

216
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,437
But I even have regrets about
not taking a dump before work, so…

217
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,732
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

218
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,485
In that case,

219
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,154
treat us to an expensive meal.

220
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,573
Okay, fine. What do you want?

221
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
-This one.
-This?

222
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,163
-Yes.
-Get this dish too.

223
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,090
I'll get going too.

224
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,760
You know you were
being bold back there, right?

225
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,181
I thought that was my job--

226
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,894
When you're at a meeting like this,
your job is to entertain the other party,

227
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,021
not offend them.

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,775
Anyway, good work, Ms. Ahn.

229
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,947
Wait, Ms. Ahn.

230
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,083
-Take a cab.
-No, I can take a bus.

231
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,836
It'll make me feel better. Just take it.

232
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,589
-No, sir. It's okay.
-Just take the money.

233
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,633
I told you it'd make me feel better.

234
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,846
Just take it!

235
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,435
See you tomorrow.

236
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,097
The meeting went great
thanks to you, Ms. Ahn!

237
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,184
It's good manners to accept
what your superiors give you.

238
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,729
Just take it. It'll make me feel better.

239
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,993
Are you done?
Do you want to meet tomorrow evening?

240
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,217
-Good morning.
-Hi.

241
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,176
Hello.

242
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,689
-Have you had breakfast?
-I had a sandwich.

243
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,793
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes?

244
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,463
Here's the receipt from last night
for Mr. Yuk's operating expenses.

245
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,176
Did the meeting end late yesterday?

246
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,887
A little.

247
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,183
Okay, I'll process this.

248
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,908
That's our branch manager.
Who was the woman next to him?

249
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,495
All I know is that it wasn't his wife.

250
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,289
She was younger and prettier.

251
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,959
If it was yesterday, then…

252
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,635
Ms. Ahn.

253
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,763
I'm meeting Seonghun Construction today.

254
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,848
Come with me.

255
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,771
Mr. Yuk, let me accompany you today.

256
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,275
They're Ms. Ahn's clients,
so she should go.

257
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,736
You need to play golf
with a client this weekend.

258
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,781
Yes, sir.

259
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,451
Mr. Yuk.

260
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,080
If they need me to explain the product,

261
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,459
I'll visit their office
during business hours.

262
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,215
Are you saying that you won't go?

263
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,181
I feel uncomfortable having drinks
when no business is being conducted.

264
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,811
Are you refusing to do your job
simply because you feel uncomfortable?

265
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,564
Not just today, but from here on out?

266
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,362
I don't believe
it's my duty to entertain clients.

267
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,755
All right. I'll go alone, then.

268
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,221
In that case, Ms. Ahn, you should
clean out the filing room today.

269
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,058
Some of the documents have expired,
and it's a huge mess in there.

270
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,019
Pull them out and organize everything
before our next audit

271
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,313
and have them shredded by Monday.

272
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,276
I'll do it with her, then.

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,321
-It's too much to do alone.
-You don't have time for that.

274
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,907
Instead of paying attention
to menial work,

275
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,160
you should update
the list of the Winner's Plan clients.

276
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,832
I want everyone
to focus on their own jobs.

277
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,751
Ms. Ahn.

278
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,755
I hope you don't feel
uncomfortable about this.

279
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,467
I'll do it.

280
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,793
May I give you a hand?

281
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,588
Tell me what to do. I can help.

282
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,214
You should go study.

283
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,301
-But still…
-Mr. Yuk will get mad

284
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,261
if he finds out you were in here.

285
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,685
LOCKER ROOM

286
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,022
My gosh, Ms. Ahn
is having the worst day today.

287
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,191
Mr. Yuk used to adore her,
but not anymore.

288
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,358
He's one scary guy.

289
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,069
Cleaning out the filing room
is a two-person job.

290
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,531
It means she has to finish today
in order to shred files by Monday.

291
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,326
She'll have to work this weekend.

292
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,994
This is abuse.

293
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,206
She's pretty tenacious, though.
I'm sure she'll manage.

294
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,457
Whatever.

295
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,708
-Let's go.
-Okay.

296
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,841
What are you doing? Let's go.

297
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,802
You can go on ahead.

298
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,665
Are you okay?

299
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,460
Yes.

300
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,507
Let me help.

301
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,968
Didn't you hear Mr. Yuk?

302
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:57,222
He said not to pay attention
to menial work and focus on your job.

303
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,311
This is just repetitive work.

304
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,729
It's okay, really.

305
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,863
I sent you a text message yesterday.

306
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,371
I got tired and fell asleep.

307
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,753
Should I wait?

308
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,388
This is going to take a while.
You should go ahead and leave.

309
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,893
Thank you.

310
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,188
KCU BANK

311
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,604
Eat dinner as you work. You got this!

312
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,694
Thank you.

313
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,088
You should've brought
enough food for both of us.

314
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,341
I can't believe
you only got enough for yourself.

315
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:43,138
You said you were on a diet
and that you weren't going to eat.

316
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,182
This isn't a restaurant.
It's a massage shop.

317
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,436
Why are you eating here?
And what's with the long face?

318
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,146
I'm fine.

319
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,774
You're here often.

320
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,277
I was just bored and stopped by.

321
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,028
Why are you bored?

322
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,239
There are lots of
pretty ladies at the bank…

323
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,324
I mean, there should be.

324
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,578
What about you? Why won't you go on dates?

325
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,416
I dated plenty when I was younger,
so I don't feel the need.

326
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,920
And I had enough passionate relationships
before I met your father.

327
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:22,218
I don't know if this
is a proper mother-son conversation.

328
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,138
Actually, there was someone
I liked more than him,

329
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,850
but I still married your father.

330
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,563
So I figured you end up marrying
someone whom you're meant to be with.

331
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,565
And thanks to that, I had you.

332
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,780
I realized fiery,
passionate love wasn't everything.

333
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:47,368
If you just
go with the flow and follow your heart,

334
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,288
you'll end up with a kid with an old soul.

335
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,665
That's life.

336
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,629
Do you want some beer?

337
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,174
No, I have to play golf tomorrow.

338
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,472
Mom.

339
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,391
Put some ointment on your hands.
They're a mess.

340
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,103
My hands would've looked like flowers
if I lived a sheltered life,

341
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,942
but I had to live under the scorching sun
without a husband to provide shade for me.

342
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,860
Now look at my hands.

343
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,029
So where was I?

344
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,989
That's right.

345
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,993
So as soon as Seong-hye's husband
threw the spoon,

346
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,122
she ducked under the table,
and ended up with a herniated disc.

347
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,708
She's always been like that.

348
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,502
She puts up with everything,

349
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,589
so now her kitchen walls are covered
with an assortment of sauces.

350
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,302
I took a photo. Do you want to see it?

351
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:50,598
What's funny is that
it looks a bit like a Matisse.

352
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,016
-Mom.
-Yes?

353
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,186
Do you want to chat or eat?

354
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,988
You're just like your dad.

355
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,990
I wanted to get a reaction,

356
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,618
so I put two tablespoons
of salt in his stew.

357
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,246
But he just ate it without a word.

358
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,668
Even monks who made a vow of silence
would talk more than him.

359
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,046
If you have no one to talk to,
then you should meet your friends.

360
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,590
Weren't you listening to me?

361
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,968
They're all busy bickering
with their husbands.

362
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm an outcast now.

363
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,143
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

364
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,769
Then come with me.

365
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,315
-What now?
-Hurry now. Come on.

366
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,109
You need to stop shopping.

367
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,528
The price tags are still on this.

368
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,196
Why do you keep buying stuff?

369
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,157
It's my way of protesting
against your dad.

370
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,492
I'm spending as much money as possible,

371
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,369
but I can't make a dent. It's annoying.

372
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,332
Mom, I don't want this. It's not my style.

373
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,002
Just paint on it then.
You love doing that.

374
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,295
Mom, please.

375
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,213
Wait, I got another one.

376
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,474
I'm going out to play golf.
I'll see you at the wedding.

377
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,019
Where are you playing?
I'll pick you up. Let's go together.

378
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,865
President Park, I heard you found
a great plot of land recently.

379
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,909
You'll get hurt if you stand there.

380
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,162
We will do our best for the growth

381
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,082
of both our businesses
through financial support.

382
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,919
Both our businesses?
It's a better business for the bank.

383
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,547
Isn't that why you invited me
out for a round of golf?

384
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,093
President Park, if you read the proposal--

385
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,637
We came to play golf,
so let's just focus on that.

386
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,682
Do you play a little?

387
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,686
-I'm--
-Allow me to introduce--

388
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,020
I was asking him.

389
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,692
I've been practicing a lot.

390
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,070
I'll play with him this time.

391
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,658
Mr. Ha is still a beginner.
He can't even beat me.

392
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,660
What do you think?

393
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,037
Do you run when you don't stand a chance?

394
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,832
I'll give you a handicap.

395
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,672
I won't accept the handicap.

396
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,840
Instead…

397
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:36,597
if I win, please consider this proposal.

398
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,476
Sure.

399
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,812
Thank you.

400
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,192
Nice shot.

401
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,114
Nice shot.

402
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,413
Nice.

403
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,081
Excellent.

404
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,672
-Nice.
-Good.

405
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,965
Nice one.

406
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,807
-I'll do it.
-It's okay.

407
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,350
-I got it.
-It's fine.

408
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,613
You should look
a little more to the right.

409
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,656
There's a bit of an incline.

410
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,591
-Nice birdie.
-Nice birdie.

411
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,475
-Congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations.

412
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,935
Are you really a beginner?

413
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,770
I was just lucky today.

414
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,522
I was the one who got lucky.

415
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,399
I would've lost
if it hadn't been for your advice.

416
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,528
No, sir. It was an honor
to have played with you.

417
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,238
I learned a lot.

418
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,157
All right.

419
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,870
-Good work.
-Thank you, sir.

420
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,002
Thank you very much for your time today.

421
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,588
I want a rematch.

422
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,967
And bring your proposal then.

423
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,970
Thank you, President Park.

424
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,680
You've done well today, Mr. Ha.

425
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,764
-Good.
-Thank you.

426
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,562
Ms. Park, what brings you here?

427
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:48,980
Hello.

428
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,566
I'm here to pick up Mr. Ha
for an engagement.

429
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,151
May I leave with him?

430
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,611
Ms. Park.

431
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,197
-Say hello. This is Daeseong--
-Hello.

432
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,617
We should get going now.

433
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,370
Sure. See you at the bank, Ms. Park.

434
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,876
See you next time, Mr. Ha Sang-su.

435
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,043
-Yes, sir.
-Goodbye.

436
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,128
Goodbye, sir.

437
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,883
Why did you do that just now?

438
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,052
He's an important client for our branch.

439
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,348
I don't even say hi to him at home.

440
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,267
Why should I do it out here?

441
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,477
What?

442
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,105
That client was my dad.

443
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,443
I'm hungry.
Let's eat as soon as we get there.

444
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,424
MOM

445
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,182
-Hello.
-You're here.

446
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,975
-Sang-su, you're here.
-Hey.

447
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,976
It's been a while.

448
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,187
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

449
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,023
-Sang-su, I'll go upstairs first.
-Sure.

450
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,443
-Looking good.
-How have you been?

451
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,278
Good. You don't look too bad yourself.

452
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,322
I just look decent for a bank clerk.

453
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,698
You sure do look like one.

454
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,048
What is it?
Do you want to get married too?

455
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,133
What?

456
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,222
-Let's go in.
-Let's go.

457
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,139
All right.

458
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,815
Hello.

459
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,401
One has no money
after getting a doctorate,

460
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,528
and the other has never worked a day.

461
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,448
How will they make a living?
I'm so worried.

462
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,493
Why would you say that
on their wedding day?

463
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,162
I'm just worried, that's all.

464
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,623
Marriage should bring benefits,
but this is the opposite.

465
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:17,169
Who knows if it'll be good or bad?
Only they would know.

466
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,213
Everyone's standard
of happiness is relative.

467
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,383
But there's also an absolute standard.

468
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,011
If you're here to celebrate,
then stick to that.

469
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,097
Don't be so rude.
We don't talk about you behind your back.

470
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,643
We respect your picky standards
when it comes to men.

471
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,398
Sang-su.

472
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,608
-Hey.
-Hi, Sang-su.

473
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,529
Does it taste all right?

474
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,031
Yes, it's good.

475
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,991
Enjoy your meal.

476
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,706
Sang-su, is Mi-gyeong
also like this at the bank?

477
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,707
What do you mean?

478
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,250
I mean, she's arrogant.

479
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,378
Pretending like she never benefits
from her rich parents.

480
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,839
You're drunk. That's enough.

481
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,717
She got a full scholarship
throughout college.

482
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,055
I know you're proud
that you received a full scholarship,

483
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,266
but you pretty much stole it
from those who really needed it.

484
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,770
The person who lost the scholarship to you
had to work three jobs, you know.

485
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,399
Do you think you
still would've gotten the scholarship

486
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,109
if you had to work and study too?

487
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,613
You could focus on your studies

488
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,949
because you didn't have to work
thanks to your family's wealth.

489
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,037
The clothes you wear
and that bag you carry…

490
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,623
An ordinary bank clerk can't afford those.

491
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,751
You couldn't have done anything
without your father.

492
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,380
So stop pretending
like you're different from us.

493
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,215
You're being a pretentious hypocrite.

494
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,800
What's gotten into you?

495
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,636
Mi-gyeong, she's just drunk.

496
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,596
I need to go to the ladies' room.

497
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,647
It must be hard for you, Sang-su.

498
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,691
She stands on everyone's help,
thinking she achieved it all on her own.

499
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,613
Sang-hui.

500
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:14,078
I understand what you're saying,
but she's working hard and doing well.

501
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,834
I hope you'll apologize to her
when you get the chance.

502
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,347
You caught me, didn't you?

503
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,308
You caught me running away.

504
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,185
No.

505
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,440
Let's have our own reception.

506
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,401
Can you buy me a drink, Sang-su?

507
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,030
Sure. Let's go.

508
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,372
Back in school…

509
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,751
do you know what I loved to do the most?

510
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,256
Running.

511
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,262
Because the results are clear.

512
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,101
And no one could say that I won…

513
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
thanks to my parents.

514
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,400
I just…

515
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,155
wanted people to acknowledge my effort.

516
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,869
I wanted people to think
that I came this far

517
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,956
and became Park Mi-gyeong
of the Youngpo branch's PB Team

518
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,836
without the help of my parents.

519
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,801
I also work just as hard as everyone else.

520
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,935
But what's important

521
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,938
is that I'm afraid

522
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,276
you'll just think of this as a rant
coming from a spoiled rich kid.

523
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,413
I don't think of it that way.

524
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,209
Everyone has…

525
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,463
their share of pain and misfortune.

526
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,719
So I don't want to be quick to judge

527
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,640
or comfort you
without knowing the whole story.

528
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,395
I just can't do that.

529
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,950
What you just said…

530
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,539
comforts me the most.

531
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,985
We'll close down the restaurant
and leave. I'm sorry, Su-yeong.

532
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,456
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

533
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,588
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

534
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,801
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

535
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,886
Excuse me.

536
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,891
Goodness, come on in.
Looking for a lease or a tenant?

537
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,771
About the new oyster gukbap place
in the marketplace…

538
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:15,527
They insisted on opening their business
in that marketplace,

539
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,656
but now they want to cancel the lease.

540
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,367
They don't even mind
paying an early termination fee.

541
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,327
It's as if they're on the run.

542
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,913
They live up the hill.

543
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:13,836
-Here.
-Okay.

544
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,129
-Thank you.
-No problem.

545
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,541
Sang-su.

546
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,460
Where have you been?

547
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,297
Here's a hangover cure.

548
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,050
I was knocked out, wasn't I?

549
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,427
It's okay, kiddo.

550
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,471
I'll get going now.

551
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,182
Thank you.

552
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,143
-Bye.
-Thanks.

553
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,241
Goodness gracious. Oh, dear.

554
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,078
These muscle cramps are killing me.

555
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,792
This is a bank, not a hospital.

556
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,711
-Stop with the fuss.
-What is this?

557
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,213
Did you buy this for me?

558
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,759
Are you crazy?
I just saw them lying around the office.

559
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,680
You should work out more.
All you did was jog, and you're half-dead.

560
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,226
I guess the only muscle
you have is the sphincter.

561
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,394
What do you mean? I have muscles.

562
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,856
They must be playing hide-and-seek
because I can't see them.

563
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,858
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,276
Hello.

565
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,529
Sang-su.

566
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,281
Are you feeling okay?

567
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,284
Yes, thanks to someone's hangover cure.

568
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,496
-Let's head to the meeting.
-Okay.

569
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,291
Is Su-yeong still in the filing room?

570
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,835
I hope she's okay.

571
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,342
-Hello.
-Hi.

573
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,636
-Hello.
-Hey, Ji-yun.

574
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,305
Mr. Yuk was spotted.

575
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,184
He was arm-in-arm with a woman
at a naengmyeon place in Jamsil.

576
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,770
Doesn't it look like Su-yeong?

577
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:37,854
What do you think?

578
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,314
Actually,

579
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,733
I got this photo too.

580
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,695
My gosh. No way.

581
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,531
This person also looks like Su-yeong.

582
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,367
Maybe they're really seeing each other.

583
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,619
But it's weird.

584
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,622
If they are, why would Mr. Yuk
make her life so miserable?

585
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,585
Maybe it's a lover's quarrel.

586
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,796
-Get dressed.
-Okay.

587
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,755
Gosh.

588
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,443
Is the shredding truck here?

589
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,445
Yes.

590
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,072
Let's move them together.

591
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,325
You should go to your meeting.

592
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,043
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

593
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,003
You aren't fine. You're hurt.

594
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,922
Why would you…

595
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,176
Don't say you're fine when you're not.

596
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,390
You could've asked me for help
at the very least…

597
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,526
You could've done this another way.

598
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,447
-You didn't have to make it so hard--
-What other way?

599
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,829
You may find me frustrating,

600
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,332
but I'm trying to get through this
in my own way.

601
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,336
This is who I am here.

602
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,089
You know that, Mr. Ha.

603
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,262
It's funny…

604
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,644
how you thought
I had a choice in this matter.

605
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,401
Every day has been a struggle for me
at this bank since day one.

606
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,367
So don't mind me and go to your meeting.

607
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,545
Mr. Ha.

608
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,715
Please stand up.

609
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,305
Thanks to Mr. Ha,
the Youngpo branch got a chance

610
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,101
to become business partners
with Daeseong Construction.

611
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,855
Thanks to talented employees like him
who love our company,

612
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:28,108
we are able to march forward
despite people complaining

613
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,318
and neglecting their duties.

614
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,238
Mr. Ha.

615
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,911
The Deposits Team is missing a person
with Ms. Ahn shredding files,

616
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,038
so General Affairs should help.

617
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,208
And do not leave your post
trying to help Ms. Ahn.

618
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,504
If you do,
it'll be considered a dereliction of duty.

619
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,807
Is he saying

620
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,145
that he'll also hold us responsible
if we help her out?

621
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,314
He's completely bullying her.

622
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,441
This is ridiculous.

623
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,996
Where are you headed in such a hurry?

624
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,081
I…

625
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,336
The meeting is over.

626
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,130
We can get by without you, Ms. Ahn.

627
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,716
So just go do your job.

628
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,594
-Let's go.
-Yes.

629
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,356
If you ask me,
Ms. Ahn is being stubborn.

630
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,691
If she apologizes
and says she won't do it again,

631
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,860
I'm sure Mr. Yuk would accept the apology.

632
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,531
So what if he does?
She'll have to go to those meetings again.

633
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,242
What's wrong with that?
I go to those meetings too.

634
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,079
No one here

635
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,331
has been to those drinking meetings
more than she has.

636
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,501
It's part of life
to humor people when you need to.

637
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,754
I'm all about enjoying life,
but even I hold back sometimes.

638
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,632
How could a senior clerk
with no connections

639
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,260
have the guts to talk back
to the branch manager?

640
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,805
You all think she overreacted, don't you?

641
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,270
What do you think, Mr. Ha?

642
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,908
It's a choice she made.

643
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:59,926
If we step in hastily,
she could get in further trouble.

644
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,073
Yes, hello.

645
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:26,119
I'm calling about Mr. Park
and what happened last Friday…

646
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,291
No, it's not that.

647
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,855
What do you think, Mr. Ha?

648
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,985
It's a choice she made.

649
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,839
MOM

650
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,018
Why do you look so worn out?

651
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,854
Mom.

652
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,817
Don't force me.

653
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,949
You're forcing me
to forgive him just because you did.

654
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,872
It's not like that, Su-yeong.

655
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,960
Back then, when Dad…

656
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,927
When that man abandoned us…

657
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,142
and you had to work at a restaurant
while selling insurance…

658
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,522
The first thing I did when you came home
was check your feet,

659
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,111
wondering if they'd be
covered in blood again.

660
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,824
I was worried every single day.

661
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,752
On the day of Su-hyeok's death…

662
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,050
I went to meet the person
who picked up his cell phone.

663
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,728
Yes, I just arrived.

664
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,649
Yes.

665
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,409
Thank you.

666
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,376
Why did he come here?

667
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,201
Dad.

668
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,622
Su-yeong.

669
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,458
Why are you here, Dad?

670
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,922
Who's that woman?

671
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,552
We couldn't reach you for months. Why…

672
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,144
Did Su-hyeok see this too?

673
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,233
Did he come to this neighborhood
because of you?

674
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,152
What…

675
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,662
Are you Mr. Ahn Su-hyeok's guardian?

676
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,832
The patient just passed away.

677
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,636
"How did we end up like this?"

678
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,014
I thought about it again and again.

679
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,854
But I couldn't think of what it was
that we had done wrong.

680
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,779
That's why I can't understand
why you chose to forgive him.

681
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,076
Su-yeong.

682
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,747
Your father is…

683
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,342
a good man.

684
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,687
Only he and I know…

685
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,609
the sorrow of losing a child.

686
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,363
As you live on,

687
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,950
you realize that nothing really matters.

688
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,578
Don't hate your dad.

689
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:03,957
It's all my fault.

690
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,959
How is it your fault?

691
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,963
A parent who loses a child
lives forever in pain.

692
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,631
But that's my pain to bear.

693
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,007
So please…

694
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,844
don't hate anybody.

695
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,104
Just keep the restaurant open.

696
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,204
Stay here. I'll bring an umbrella.

697
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,380
What's wrong, Mom?

698
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,091
Why are you walking like that?

699
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,053
What happened?
How long has it been like this?

700
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:04,017
I'm fine.
It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it now.

701
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,853
-It doesn't hurt. I'm fine.
-You're not fine!

702
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,438
Why do you walk with a limp?

703
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,982
Mom, why on earth…

704
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,907
Can you stop making me feel bad for you?

705
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,995
Please.

706
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,124
Can you please stop living like this?

707
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,544
Su-yeong…

708
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,944
Here's what it is.

709
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,406
I like you.

710
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,705
I said I like you.

711
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,290
I'm afraid I have bad news.

712
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,044
They were right. I'm dating Mr. Jeong.

713
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,005
I hurt his pride for nothing.

714
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,683
And all though I had feelings for him…

715
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,354
If I had kept my promise…

716
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,357
that day at the hotel…

717
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,277
would you have dated me?

718
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,827
I couldn't bring myself to be honest…

719
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,624
because I could understand…

720
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,213
why he hesitated.

721
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,844
So I did not have the right…

722
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,472
to be honest about my feelings.

723
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,642
No matter how hard I tried,

724
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,895
I was stuck where I was

725
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,690
and couldn't go any further.

726
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,950
Are you all right?

727
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,832
But despite all this…

728
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,379
this man…

729
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,056
The weather is great, right?
This is my favorite weather.

730
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,227
Our neighborhood
looks the most beautiful when it rains.

731
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,612
Ms. Ahn.

732
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,740
Should we run?

733
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,036
What?

734
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,122
Let's run.

735
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,416
Here.

736
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,709
Thank you.

737
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,379
I got this for you too.

738
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,764
Why are you so nice to me?

739
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,436
Come on.
If you don't know why, then you're a fool.

740
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:44,922
Here.

741
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,930
I just think you're cool.

742
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,810
Ms. Ahn, you're such a cool person.

743
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,148
So you're not foolish at all.

744
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,987
In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

745
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,698
It'll be unimaginable.

746
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,827
Can you stop going on blind dates?

747
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,582
Sorry?

748
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,001
I like you, Ms. Ahn.

749
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,046
I waited for you to tell you that.

750
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,355
Why do you keep comforting me?

751
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,656
All done.

752
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,909
Make sure you put a fresh one on later.

753
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,587
I want to be more than just your neighbor.

754
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,551
I'm trying really hard
to become your boyfriend.

755
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,061
What I mean is--

756
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,479
Sure.

757
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,613
Be my boyfriend.

758
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,248
You wrapped my finger nicely.

759
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,921
Really? Do you mean it?

760
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,011
Yes, I mean it.

761
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,024
This isn't a dream, is it?

762
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,727
Hello.

763
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,021
We're from the Audit Team.

764
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:49,857
I see.

765
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,151
What brings you here?

766
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,402
Well…

767
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,905
We need to confirm a few things.

768
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:00,910
This way, please.

769
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,372
Can you please bring in some tea?

770
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,010
-Do you think it's about that?
-About what?

771
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,096
Mr. Yuk's affair.

772
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,349
Why would they come here
over a private matter?

773
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:29,105
They might if his mistress
is someone in the office.

774
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,617
Mr. Ma Du-sik.

775
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,245
Yes?

776
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,082
Ms. Bae Eun-jeong.
They want you in there one at a time.

777
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,252
Me?

778
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,838
Why me?

779
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,800
They want to talk to you two.

780
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,179
All I ever did was butter up my superiors.

781
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,566
What do you want to ask me?

782
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:18,612
Everything we talk about here
will be kept confidential.

783
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,072
Okay.

784
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,426
Ahn Su-yeong!

785
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,941
You…

786
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,812
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

787
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:37,293
I can take care of this myself.
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ha.

788
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,006
Don't they look good together?

789
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,050
He must really like her.
I'm so jealous that they're dating.

790
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:48,637
You're going to think of me
whenever you see a tow truck from now on.

791
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,723
Think of me, Sang-su. Abracadabra!

792
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:56,228
I can't seem to reach you, Jong-hyeon.
Is something wrong?

793
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,815
-Doesn't this feel great?
-Yes, it does.

794
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:05,446
Mr. Ha. You should meet a woman
who can fulfill your desires.

795
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:10,868
Then what about you? Did you meet someone
who could fulfill your desires?

796
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,746
Su-yeong. I have something to tell you.

797
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:20,586
