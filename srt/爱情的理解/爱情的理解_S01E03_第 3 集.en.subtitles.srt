00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,405
Okay, good.

4
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,866
-Goodness, one second.
-Okay.

5
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,121
Take this too.

00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,684
Have you had breakfast?

8
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,317
It's not good to skip breakfast
when you start work early.

9
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,320
I'll leave it here. Please eat it.

10
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,037
-Are you all right, sir?
-Gosh.

11
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,830
Would you like to eat breakfast?

13
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,930
Here.

14
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,056
Thank you.

15
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,353
Did you make this yourself?

16
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,440
Yes. I got sick of eating out.

17
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Enjoy.

18
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,581
It's good.

19
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,335
I'm glad you like it.
I was worried you wouldn't.

20
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,382
I made it
because I knew you were opening today.

21
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,761
I wanted to share it with you.

22
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
Why are you not asking me any questions?

23
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,570
You saw what happened back there.

24
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,537
Then, may I ask you just one question?

25
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,878
Your cell phone background
is a photo of a man.

26
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,715
Who is he?

27
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,970
Is he your boyfriend?

28
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,351
No.

29
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,397
It's someone…

30
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,526
who loves me more than anyone else.

I'm in front of your house right now.

33
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,546
I need to tell you something.

AHN SU-YEONG

35
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,158
I'm in front of your house, Ms. Ahn.

36
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,492
I'll be waiting.

37
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,119
I'm sorry. I tripped.

38
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,581
You didn't have to rush.

39
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,291
Is your foot okay?

40
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,085
Yes.

41
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,005
So… how long have you been waiting?

42
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,757
This is so unexpected.

43
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,012
I wanted to tell you something.

44
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,019
Can you stop going on blind dates?

45
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,398
Sorry?

46
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,693
I like you, Ms. Ahn.

47
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,780
I waited for you to tell you that.

48
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,637
Is there another reason?

49
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:17,979
Is there a reason that I'm not aware of?

50
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,857
This is none of your business.

51
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,340
I saw that you called yesterday.

52
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,345
It was because of work. I took care of it.

53
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,025
You made some interesting revisions.

54
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,110
Sang-su.

55
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,365
Sorry? What is it? Is something wrong?

56
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,994
No, it's really great. I'm impressed.

57
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,915
It's because you
put together a great draft.

58
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,334
I just wanted to combine
nine apps into three.

59
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,377
You're proposing
that we start from scratch.

60
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,922
Research showed that people thought

61
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,509
there were too many apps,
so they didn't know when to use what.

62
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,261
The biggest problem was accessibility,

63
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,597
I thought it'd be best
to combine, simplify the apps

64
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,142
and inform our customers
on exactly when and how to use them.

65
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,271
I think we just came up
with the best proposal.

66
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,608
The presentation is tomorrow,
so let's refine it until then.

67
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,154
You're different from what I've heard.

68
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,073
What do you mean?

69
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,159
You got into all kinds of trouble
when you were a rookie.

70
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,412
What's the secret?
When did you get so good at this?

71
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,956
You're being cheeky again.

72
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,251
We need good food
to give a good presentation.

73
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,211
Dinner is on me tonight.

74
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,964
Okay, sure.

VIP INVESTMENT TREND ANALYSIS

77
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,978
Not bad.

78
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,941
You selected suitable clients
and chose excellent approach methods.

79
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,360
Thank you.

80
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,988
Is this your first time
selling products to VIPs?

81
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,908
You show so much promise.

83
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,620
It must've been disappointing
to handle only depository work.

84
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,920
Keep up the good work, Ms. Ahn.

85
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,800
If you pull this off,
your position will change for the better.

86
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,928
I'll try my best, sir.

87
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,682
It's not enough to try your best
in our line of work.

88
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,143
You also need the drive, passion,

89
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,521
and loyalty to the company
to make this happen.

90
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
I see.

91
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,067
I'll do what I can to help you
transfer positions next quarter.

92
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,154
It's a loss for the bank
for someone as talented as you

93
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,197
to stay as a service rep.

94
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,623
Su-yeong, you're like a daughter to me.

95
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,917
You know that
I'm always rooting for you, right?

96
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,047
Mr. Yuk, can you please
check this progress report?

97
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,262
Why do you look so surprised?

98
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,221
Goodness.

99
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,307
I forgot to knock.

100
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,104
I'm sorry, Ms. Ahn,
but could you give us a moment?

101
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,357
-This is an urgent matter.
-Sure.

102
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,242
Mr. Yuk, you haven't changed.
Still so caring.

103
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,913
You pay special attention
to every single clerk here.

104
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,251
Perhaps that's why my father
also trusts you implicitly.

105
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,255
Your father is doing well, yes?

106
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,758
Yes, thanks to you.

107
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,926
That's good to hear.

108
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,019
Don't just sit there and take it
when he's like that.

109
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,231
I know, but he never quite
crosses the line.

110
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,774
It'll seem like I'm overreacting.

111
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,444
From now on, don't go to his office alone.

112
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,029
What's wrong with that man?

113
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,077
Ms. Park, you seem so confident,
and you don't let anyone get to you.

114
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,622
I've done nothing wrong, so why should I?

115
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,334
Thank you.

116
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,381
If you want to thank me,
then let's be friends.

117
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,341
I need to take you under my wing.

118
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,938
Hey, where did these guys go?

119
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,609
Mr. Kim, the instructor, hurt his knee,
so they're subbing for him.

120
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,694
I see.

121
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,115
I wonder if they can get the applications
and fees that are due this quarter.

122
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,325
I'm not so sure about this.

123
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,455
Can someone…

124
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,170
Ms. Ahn, I'm glad I ran into you.

125
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,089
Can you do a follow-up at the class?

126
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,299
Sure, I'll go.

127
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,929
What kind of class is this?

128
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,639
You've never heard of it?

129
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,391
It's a singing class.

130
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,144
-What?
-It's our community service program.

131
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,856
It's important for the Youngpo branch
to be a part of the community.

132
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,651
It's similar to how department stores
operate cultural centers.

133
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,488
It's a way of attracting clients
by disguising it as a service.

134
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,364
Do people take these classes?

135
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,782
Depends on the instructor.

136
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,703
If the instructor is popular, it's full.
If the instructor is bad, then no.

137
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,413
Here.

138
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,334
-Mr. Ma, let's have some coffee.
-Yes, sir.

139
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,670
Mr. Jeong? A moment, please.

140
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,804
Mr. Jeong, we need some coffee.

141
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,223
-Okay.
-Wait.

142
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,935
You forgot the extra shot
in Mr. Lee's coffee before.

143
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,353
Don't forget this time.

144
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,438
Yes, sir.

145
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,439
Mr. Jeong?

146
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,567
I'm sorry, but can you pick up
some gimbap on your way back?

147
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,613
A client from Daeyeong Building is coming,
so I don't have time to go out.

148
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,114
Tuna gimbap, please.

149
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,533
Yes, Ms. Bae.

150
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,120
Do you need anything, Mr. Ha?

151
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,334
No, I'm fine.

152
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,589
I'm going to check out the class.

153
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,633
I'll get going too.

154
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,648

Not there. Please sign here.

157
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,290
Right.

158
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,002
Let me write it for you. Just a second.

159
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,590
What's your address?

160
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,633
-Seoul.
-Okay, Seoul.

Thank you.

168
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,709
Do you like the artist Yoon Chung-a?

169
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,921
Do you know her?

170
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,882
That's from her private exhibition
at PK Gallery last year.

171
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,175
I was there too.

172
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,844
She's a budding artist,
so not many know her.

173
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,430
I met her in Germany through a friend.

174
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,974
I see.

175
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,811
Her modernistic approach suits you well.

176
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,357
I just like her work.
I don't understand it fully.

177
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,692
Have you seen her early work?

178
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,195
I have photos
of her private exhibition in Germany.

179
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,238
Really?

180
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,492
Let's have lunch later.
I'll show you the photos then.

181
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,534
Okay.

182
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,954
Sang-su…

183
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,580
I mean Mr. Ha.

184
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,458
Do you want to eat lunch
with Ms. Ahn and me?

185
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,711
No, my lunch break is after yours.

186
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,273
I wasn't sure what you liked,
so I ordered everything.

187
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,527
That's a line I normally use
with guys I'm interested in.

188
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,073
I wanted to treat you
because you had to cover my duties.

189
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
Thank you.

190
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,035
And here.

191
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,162
This is a list of clients
that I plan to contact.

192
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,749
It includes their investment type,
deposited sums, and preferred futures.

193
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,627
I know that file.
I'm the one who put it together.

194
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,717
I knew it. It was too well-organized
for it to be Mr. Ma's work.

195
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,884
Let's eat.

196
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,890
Ms. Ahn, have you considered
transferring positions?

197
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,350
You've worked enough years,

198
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,978
and you seem to be
the best clerk at the branch.

199
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,691
Well, things aren't so bad right now.

200
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,319
You should still try out next quarter.

201
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,988
I'll help you.

202
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,869
You started working here long before me.

203
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,078
Sorry if I overstepped.

204
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,539
No, it's okay.

205
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,501
It's because I like you, Ms. Ahn.

206
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,631
What is it?

207
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,677
I'm not used to people
saying that they like me.

208
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,639
Most women find me uncomfortable.

209
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,935
They're jealous of your looks.

210
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,854
That must feel so unfair.

211
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,231
I've had my fair share
of experience with that,

212
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,400
but it's actually a good thing.

213
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,072
Are you ready
for tomorrow's in-house contest?

214
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
Sang-su did most of it, so…

215
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,161
Mr. Ha, I mean.

216
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,580
Why is it so hard for me
to call him Mr. Ha?

217
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,833
Actually, we went to the same college.

218
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,629
Preparing was fun
because I felt like I was back in college.

219
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,717
Okay, enjoy your lunch.
Let me know if you need more.

220
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,646
Auntie, I'll take a beer.

221
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,647
Sure.

222
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,113
Are you crazy?
It's not even non-alcoholic.

223
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,156
Wait, are you drinking too?

224
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
Fine, go ahead. Drink.

225
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,996
It's tradition to drink while farming,

226
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,665
so I guess it's the same thing.

227
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,916
Drink up.

228
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,502
Hey.

229
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,463
Let me ask you this
because I just don't get it.

230
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,714
What is it now?

231
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,426
This isn't about me.
I read this in a book.

232
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,972
This woman told this man
who confessed his feelings for her

233
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,182
that she's dating someone else.

234
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,350
And?

235
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,102
That means she has a boyfriend, right?

236
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,396
Then she says
she's going on a date with another guy,

237
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,732
so he's wondering
what on earth is going on.

238
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,318
Why would she hug her boyfriend if…

239
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,948
So? What about the hug?

240
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,668
Tell me about the hug.

241
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,338
Auntie, can we get our food quickly?

242
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,381
Sure.

243
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,343
Thank you for lunch.

244
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,596
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes.

245
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,560
I don't get why people give out flyers.
It doesn't seem efficient, does it?

246
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,520
Right.

247
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,357
Hello, we recently opened
a new restaurant.

248
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,318
Hello, sir.

249
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,070
Please come by. Thank you.

250
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,203
Are the numbers not adding up?

251
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,121
I guess something is missing.

252
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,501
I'm finished, Ms. Ahn.

253
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,756
Mr. Ha, can you give her a hand
before you go home?

254
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,593
Do you need my help?

255
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,263
No, I'm okay.

256
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,267
I have to get ready for tomorrow,
so please excuse me.

257
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,478
Right. Got it.

258
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,792
Grow up already, Sang-su.

259
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,506
Sang-su.

260
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,007
Hey.

261
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,467
Shall we?

262
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,177
Okay.

263
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,535
I saw that you called yesterday.

264
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,080
It was because of work. I took care of it.

265
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,961
Do you need my help?

266
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,599
JEONG JONG-HYEON
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

267
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,318
Jong-hyeon.

268
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,385
Isn't it nice to have a friend nearby?

269
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,555
We can drink milk together
after work like this.

270
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,312
Jong-hyeon--

271
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,565
Please don't feel
that you have to reciprocate my feelings.

272
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,984
I don't expect anything right now.

273
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,780
I just wanted to let you know how I felt.

274
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:51,745
I panicked a little
when I heard about your blind date.

275
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,628
Wait.

276
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,800
Here.

277
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,676
I couldn't throw them out.

278
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,846
Your father left this behind.

279
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,433
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

280
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,397
Jong-hyeon, you never try
to pry into my life.

281
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,900
It makes me feel bad.

282
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,283
Would things look different up there?

283
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,454
The night view, I mean.

284
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,083
Do you think it would make
that much of a difference?

285
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,046
What if it does?

286
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,802
Then maybe I should try
living there someday.

287
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:55,684
It looks like it'll cost quite a lot,
but I want to see how different it is.

288
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,942
I'm going to pass the next exam.

289
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,944
And one day,

290
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,739
I'm going to look at the night view
from way up there.

291
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,286
What's so funny?

292
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,208
You remind me of someone

293
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,629
who would have been
as hard-working as you.

294
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,873
I can't stay long.
I need to touch up the presentation.

295
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,294
Don't forget
that I'm attending the same presentation.

296
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,381
Just one drink, okay?
Which wine do you prefer?

297
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:13,470
I don't know too much about wine.
I'll go with whatever you choose.

298
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,180
I like how you don't put on an act.

299
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,310
-Really?
-Was that funny?

300
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,812
I didn't even say much.

301
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,940
It was hilarious.

302
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,984
You seem easily amused.

303
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,488
No, you just have
a way of telling stories.

304
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,032
Me? Not at all.

305
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,743
You're totally funny and amusing.

306
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,457
Anyway, how's work so far? Is it okay?

307
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,418
You had to enter a competition
on your first day. It must be a lot.

308
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,798
Things are going well
thanks to you, Sang-su.

309
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,928
But you'll get busy
if our presentation is chosen.

310
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,096
Can you handle that?

311
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,057
Ms. Ahn does a great job of backing me up.

312
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,520
I had lunch with her today.
She seemed really nice.

313
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
Right.

314
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,487
So what have you been up to? Just working?

315
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,826
You were like that in college.

316
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,577
Why don't you ever date?

317
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,913
Wait, or are you into…

318
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,499
It's not like that, punk.

319
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,127
Then why won't you date?

320
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,426
Because I don't like dating
and breaking up on a whim.

321
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,388
Then do you prefer
serious relationships and breakups?

322
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,728
There's a sense of responsibility.

323
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,356
Having feelings for someone

324
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,151
comes with responsibility.

325
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,620
It's their signature menu item.
This dish has even won awards.

326
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,832
Can I get this to go, by any chance?

327
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,334
Yes.

328
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,672
I want to take this to someone.

329
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,010
-Goodbye.
-Okay, goodbye.

330
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,228
What's this?

331
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,272
It's not Mother's Day. What's going on?

332
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,024
Midnight-snack delivery, ma'am.

333
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,364
When will you introduce her to me?

334
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,743
It's obvious you were on a date.

335
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,789
With that persistence,
you should've studied

336
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,084
-and gone to a prestigious college--
-I have a son who went instead.

337
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,960
Ms. Han.

338
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,295
Ms. Han, are you there?

339
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,756
Goodness.

340
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,549
What brings you here at this hour?

341
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,885
I knew I could count on you to be here.

342
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,806
My face broke out
after playing a round of golf.

343
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,600
I have an appointment in the morning.
Can you help me?

344
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,601
Of course.

345
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,478
Go and lie down. I'll be in soon.

346
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,854
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

347
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,107
It stings so badly.

348
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,405
Wait, are you done eating?

349
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,031
I have a client to tend to.

350
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,366
But it's after hours.

351
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,951
-Just tell her no.
-Whatever.

352
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,829
That's not what's important.
Tell me about her.

353
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,414
It's nothing, Mom.

354
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,084
Nothing came out of it.

355
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,508
It sounds like there was someone,
but she turned you down.

356
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,135
Who would turn down my son?

357
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,220
What? I didn't get turned down.

358
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,389
-Is it because I'm a single mom?
-Mom.

359
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,266
That's not it. I'm serious.

360
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,768
Is she from a prominent family?

361
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,523
Mom, go on ahead.
I'll clean up here. Hurry. Go on now.

362
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,947
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

363
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,168
Here.

364
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,838
I grabbed it as soon as it expired,
so it's fresh.

365
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,300
You can't call expired food "fresh."

366
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,386
-Forget it, then.
-Hey, I still want it.

367
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,014
Here.

368
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,311
Now that you work at a burger joint,
it feels like I got connections.

369
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,938
What's so great about that?

370
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,067
I'm worried it'll take forever
to make enough money to live a good life.

371
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,652
What do you mean?

372
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,530
Of course, you'll live a good life.
Dream big, sis.

373
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,577
My dream is to live
an average, ordinary life.

374
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,912
That's it?

375
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,332
An average, ordinary life
means you want for nothing,

376
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,501
which equals an all-around good life.

377
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,462
That's how I want to live.

378
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,217
Just you wait.

379
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll get my motorcycle license
and become a delivery master.

380
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,514
And?

381
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,143
I'll buy you a house with a huge balcony
in the heart of Seoul.

382
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,313
You can grow all kinds of herbs
on the balcony.

383
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,690
You can also paint and play the piano.

384
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,735
Gosh, how exciting.

385
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,446
Don't you trust me?

386
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,950
You should know me by now.
I'm a man of my word.

387
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,245
So, sis, you just focus on being happy.

388
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,544
AHN SU-HYEOK

389
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,359
Why are you here? Go away.

390
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:08,658
Go. Get out of here, Dad!
This is all your fault! Get out!

391
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,910
I said get out!

392
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,330
It's all your fault, Dad.

393
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,651
Su-yeong.

394
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,654
Goodness, you're here.

395
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,576
Don't just stand there.

396
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,453
-Make her some food.
-Right.

397
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,122
Don't come near the bank ever again.

398
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,498
Have you eaten?

399
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,543
At least have a bite before you go.

400
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,755
-We made your favorite oyster jeon--
-Why here?

401
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,549
You could've gone anywhere else.

402
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,052
Why did you have to come here
of all places?

403
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,641
We didn't come here for a specific reason.

404
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,685
We just wanted to see you occasionally--

405
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,354
Since when did you care so much?

406
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,899
How could you take him back?

407
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,072
Have I…

408
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,950
Have I eaten?

409
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,911
Why are you asking that question now?

410
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,415
Why do you think Su-hyeok…

411
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,132
Why do you think he died?

412
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
To me…

413
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,191
No, to us. You were already dead to us.

414
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,279
So don't act like you care about me.

415
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,533
Stop hovering around me.

416
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,577
Su-yeong.

417
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,289
-It's not that--
-Honey.

418
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,839
Su-hyeok kept his promise to me.

419
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,554
No.

420
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,223
Su-hyeok's promise…

421
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,477
is what held me together.

422
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,983
I'll buy you a house with a huge balcony
in the heart of Seoul.

423
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,278
You can grow all kinds of herbs
on the balcony.

424
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,739
You can also paint and play the piano.

425
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,953
So, sis, you just focus on being happy.

426
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,249
Whenever I felt like giving up,

427
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,419
I always reminded myself of his promise.

428
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,216
Su-hyeok essentially saved me.

429
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,509
Guess who?

430
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,928
What? Hey!

431
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,648
I had to be happy.

432
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,819
I had to become happy.

433
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,948
Because my happiness…

434
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,785
came with responsibility.

435
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,325
SANG-SU

436
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,203
Sang-su!

437
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,662
Were you asleep?

438
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,249
That's a classic ex-boyfriend line.

439
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,045
Hey, I was wondering

440
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,923
if you had the open-platform
environment analysis data.

441
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,802
I do, but it's on my desk
back at the bank.

442
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,972
No, I'll come with you.

443
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,724
I'll get ready and go.

444
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,393
I'll be there.

445
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,229
Okay.

446
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,609
This is Chief Ha Sang-su
of the Youngpo branch.

447
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,403
I need to deactivate
the security system to get inside.

448
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,613
Thank you.

449
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,640
You finally noticed me.

450
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,226
Why are you here?
I said you didn't have to come.

451
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,894
Some take on team projects alone

452
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,313
because they think
they're better than everyone,

453
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,774
but in your case,
you have a competent partner.

454
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:03,072
In that case, why don't you handle
the app service reformation strategy?

455
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,865
Shall I?

456
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,867
But eat this first.

457
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,327
Okay.

458
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,188
I wasn't asleep.

459
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,733
You snored, but let's say you didn't.

460
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,155
I snored? I've never snored in my life.

461
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,908
We have some time left,
so go home and wash up.

462
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,703
That's not how this works.

463
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,997
You have to look tired
so that others will notice.

464
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,084
I look perfect right now.

465
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,795
I look tired enough to take some credit.

466
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,466
Gosh, my arm is numb.

467
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,559
I thought I was in charge
of opening today.

468
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,228
I had to prepare for the presentation.

469
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,313
Good morning.

470
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,567
You're here too, Ms. Park?

471
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,029
No need to call me Ms. Park
when we're off the clock.

472
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,113
Okay, Gyeong-pil?

473
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,574
Okay, got it.

474
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,951
If you haven't had breakfast,
come with us.

475
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,121
You guys should go. I need to open up.

476
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,128
Is there any place
that's open at this hour?

477
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,138
Here we go.

478
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,474
Enjoy your meal.

479
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,559
-I will.
-Gosh, you're up early today.

480
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,269
-Thank you.
-Sure.

481
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,396
Thank you.

482
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,940
This looks great.

483
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,537
You don't like oyster gukbap?

484
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,207
No, I just don't eat a lot.

485
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:19,917
I see.

486
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,463
But it didn't seem like that
when we had gamjatang before.

487
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,341
I only have salad for breakfast.

488
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,301
Fine, I got it.

489
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,100
-Does this go in the kitchen?
-What?

490
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,935
No, you don't have to do that.

491
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,562
-Goodness, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

492
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,106
Goodness, thank you.

493
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,608
My goodness.

494
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,450
Allocate 10% of your savings

495
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,911
into this product at 58% pre-tax…

496
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,045
-Here's the cake you ordered.
-Thank you.

497
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,505
Have a nice day.

498
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,739
JEONG JONG-HYEON

499
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,949
You got this!

500
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,960
Hello, ma'am. I'm from KCU Bank.

501
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,139
Hello.

502
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,228
Your birthday is next week,
so I'm here to wish you a happy birthday.

503
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,312
Are you new?

504
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,315
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Ahn Su-yeong of the Youngpo branch.

505
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,861
I'm here today because--

506
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,198
Étoile, come back here.

507
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,242
Are you hungry?

508
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,910
Let's sit here.

509
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,496
This is a gift for Étoile, ma'am.

510
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,872
It's cat coat supplement.

511
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,378
How did you know Étoile
had a hair loss problem?

512
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,755
Go on.

513
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,634
This is an exclusive stock-related product

514
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,387
that is available for a limited-time
only for VIP clients.

515
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,807
It might be more convenient for you
to invest in real estate

516
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,976
since you spend over
half of the year in France.

517
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,604
But recent trends indicate a preference
for three-month-long, short-term products.

518
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,024
Sure, I'll sign up.

519
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,903
After all, I know some people
at the Youngpo branch,

520
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,948
and you're quite friendly and pretty.

521
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,449
Thank you, ma'am.

522
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,578
Please visit our branch,
and we'll process it right away.

523
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,373
Try some. It's our maid's specialty.

524
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,083
Yes, thank you.

525
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,419
Miss, can you come here?

526
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,553
Take these with you.

527
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,180
Take them and share them
with your colleagues.

528
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,891
Thank you so much for these treats.

529
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,949
It's my daughter's favorite piece.

530
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,953
Your daughter has excellent taste too.

531
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,040
I'll take my leave, then.

532
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,958
-Take care.
-Thank you.

533
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,484
What do you think?

534
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,487
This is too hard.

535
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,322
-Right?
-Yes.

536
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,908
What is it? What's wrong?

537
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,452
NEW-ARRIVAL LIPSTICK COMPARISON

538
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,830
-This one?
-They look the same to me.

539
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,290
They're totally different.

540
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,709
This hot pink pairs well
with cool undertones,

541
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,961
and this peach coral
is for warm undertones.

542
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,172
Cool? Warm? What's that?

543
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,549
-What's my undertone?
-You know what it is.

544
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,134
-What?
-Booze undertone.

545
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,137
Your face is just red all the time.

546
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,223
Goodness. Stop drinking so much.

547
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,225
You got that tone, Ms. Seo.

548
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,810
Stinky soybean undertone.

549
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,603
That punk.

550
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,689
I can't believe that punk.

551
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,152
Anyway, I hope Ms. Ahn is doing well.

552
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,696
Don't worry.
She has the power of persuasion.

553
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:05,244
It's much better to deal with rich people
than to get harassed by marketplace folks.

554
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,912
Darling.

555
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,207
Do you take private lessons?

556
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:16,255
You always have the snarkiest things
to say about everything.

557
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,841
Karma will get you one day
if this continues.

558
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,052
Well, I still like working at the bank.

559
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,638
It's cool in the summer
and warm during winter.

560
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,890
Right then.

561
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:32,771
My dear Ji-yun,
you're as pure as baby skin.

562
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,190
You're so fresh and clear
with zero blemishes.

563
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,401
Have you heard from Sang-su and Ms. Park?

564
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,988
It starts at 2:00,
so they're probably getting ready.

565
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,614
I hope they do well.

566
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,576
Don't worry about them.

567
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,078
You should worry about
your own future, Mr. Ma.

568
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,497
Gosh, thanks for your support.

569
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,417
Darn it.

570
00:45:56,295 --> 00:46:00,090
Our bank currently operates
a total of nine different apps.

571
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,925
The sheer number of apps

572
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,012
makes it difficult to update them
and leads to many system errors.

573
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:12,227
But who are we to decide
which apps to keep or discard?

574
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,857
What's important is not evaluating
the pros and cons of the apps.

575
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,900
Instead, it's this.

576
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:18,901
ALL-IN-ONE KCU

577
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,611
Integration.

578
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,198
A simplified app that integrates
the pros of all the other apps.

579
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,456
Why aren't you smoking?

580
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you want one?

581
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,961
I quit ages ago.

582
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,883
I'm going to quit too.

583
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,929
I really should quit now.

584
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,725
You're going to quit smoking.
Why get so sentimental about it?

585
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,981
You looked really good up there.

586
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,566
Nicely done.

587
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,029
I appreciate your compliment.

588
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,406
Do you have plans this weekend?

589
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,741
Hang out with me.

590
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,077
I'll hang out with you
as a reward for today.

591
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,831
Sure. Sounds good.

592
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,624
Jong-hyeon.

593
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,712
I study here too.
Don't mind me and keep studying.

594
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,657
You seem happy these days.

595
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,622
I got certified in investment consulting
and financial planning,

596
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,083
but I never had a chance to practice it,

597
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,629
because I usually dealt
with people in the marketplace.

598
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,510
It's not that I didn't like it.

599
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,097
It just felt like an ATM could do my job.

600
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,808
Well, that's what I sometimes thought.

601
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,687
But this job was different.

602
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,149
The clients would listen to me
and decide to invest.

603
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,902
If I do well this first season,

604
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,321
they might ask me
to handle the next batch.

605
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,366
And that could help me
with my position transfer.

606
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,623
What's with the look?

607
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,377
I just think you're cool.

608
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,171
-Me?
-Yes.

609
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,174
Ms. Ahn, you're such a cool person.

610
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,054
I thought I was more pretty than cool.

611
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,265
No, you're definitely the cool type.

612
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,480
I'm going to study hard
and become a cool person too.

613
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,560
-Isn't it fun?
-It's so fun!

614
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,644
Is it?

615
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,522
-One.
-Wait a second.

616
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,482
Two.

617
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,526
-One, two.
-Wait, this is really scary.

618
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,445
I said I wanted to hang out.

619
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,906
I didn't say I wanted to learn
how to walk again.

620
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,991
You said we could do what I wanted.

621
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,118
I can walk just fine on dry land.

622
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,620
I don't have to walk on ice…

623
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,288
Sang-su, just a second!

624
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:27,167
Okay, let's focus on
your center of gravity.

625
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,127
-Okay.
-Bend your knees a little.

626
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,295
-Bend my knees.
-Right.

627
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,214
-Like this?
-Yes.

628
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,465
-One.
-Good.

629
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,674
-Two.
-Two.

630
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,802
-Like this?
-Yes.

631
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,351
Why on earth do you like ice hockey?

632
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,187
Because the rules are clear on the ice.

633
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,523
Don't fall and go full speed.

634
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,191
That's why I like it.

635
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,154
Me too.

636
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,825
I think I might start liking it too.

637
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,081
Oh, my gosh! Wait!

638
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:12,796
I think that's enough. Let's stop.
You'll end up getting muscle aches.

639
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,758
I really can't move anymore.
Go ahead and get changed first.

640
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,343
I'll slowly make my way back.

641
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,761
Are you sure?

642
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,096
Yes, just go.

643
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,389
-Hold on.
-Okay.

644
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,815
-Sit and rest for a bit.
-All right.

645
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,110
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

646
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,709
Okay.

647
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,963
One. Two.

648
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,883
One. Two.

649
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,802
One. Two.

650
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,858
KCU BANK

651
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,445
AHN SU-YEONG

652
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,126
Ms. Ahn, are you going for lunch?

653
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,628
Come with us.

654
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,840
No, I already have plans.

655
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,216
Enjoy your lunch, then.

656
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,551
-Enjoy.
-Let's go.

657
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,567
Ms. Ahn, hop in.

658
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,282
Hey.

659
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,788
You're the first passenger
to ride in my new car.

660
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,292
It's nice.

661
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,172
Should we speak casually?
We're about the same age, after all.

662
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,679
Did I get ahead of myself again?
Gosh, I need to stop doing that.

663
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,556
I always jump the gun when I like someone.

664
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,977
Why waste time with someone I like?

665
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,064
I'm okay with that.

666
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,691
Really?

667
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,818
Let's drop the formality, then.

668
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,827
I reserved this for you, Su-yeong.

669
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,790
Why are you so nice to me?

670
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,669
Because you're doing
a great job with PB duties,

671
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,798
and I'd rather have lunch with someone
whom I'm thankful for.

672
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,633
Is that strange?

673
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,593
No, I like it too.

674
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,266
Pretty, isn't it?

675
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,603
Yes. The design is pretty,
but the material looks unique too.

676
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,231
You really have a good eye.

677
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,900
It's pure bronze and very rare.

678
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,445
Is it very expensive?

679
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,281
It's not rare if you can
buy it with money.

680
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,409
My friend who does metalwork
made it for me.

681
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,869
I see.

682
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,288
Do you want it?

683
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,041
No, I just thought it was pretty.

684
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,002
It's okay. I have another one at home.

685
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,087
No, really. You don't have to.

686
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,092
Okay, then I'll take it
after you've worn it for a very long time.

687
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,970
You're so cute even when you say no.

688
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:49,929
Let's eat.

689
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,100
Thank you for lunch.

690
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,688
I hope you like it.

691
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,403
It must be inconvenient to park
so far away from the bank.

692
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,573
Only team leaders and higher-ups
get to park here.

693
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,743
At my old job, even though
there was plenty of parking space,

694
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,744
I felt self-conscious.

695
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:14,913
Why?

696
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,416
Because my car was nicer
than the branch manager's. Silly, right?

697
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,336
People care about the weirdest things.

698
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,296
I'll take my leave, then.

699
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,173
-Take care.
-Thank you.

700
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,145
After all, I know some people
at the Youngpo branch.

701
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,113
Come to my place sometime.

702
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,906
Let's hang out and paint.

703
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,202
Just a second.

704
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,328
Hello?

705
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,498
What?

706
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,460
Really?

707
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,131
Yes, okay. Thank you.

708
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,592
Sang-su!

709
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,430
Oh, my gosh!

710
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,266
We did it.

711
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,574
Our presentation came out top!

712
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,369
Good job, Sang-su!

713
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:48,715
KARAOKE BAR

714
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,216
All right.

715
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,427
Ms. Park.

716
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,096
Mr. Ha.

717
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,015
Great work.

718
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,934
Let's keep up the good work, okay?

719
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,688
But the final decision hasn't been made.

720
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,315
Isn't this a bit much?

721
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:09,903
But we beat the Dangsang branch
and came out top of our district.

722
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,780
I'm proud of you, Sang-su.

723
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,865
He did a great job.

724
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,451
Stop acting like you had a hand in this.

725
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,287
Come on, let's be honest.
I groomed Sang-su.

726
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,499
But both Ms. Park and Mr. Ha
are doing very well

727
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,918
thanks to our branch manager, right?

728
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,128
He has a great eye
when it comes to people,

729
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,339
and puts the right person
up for the right job.

730
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,549
It's an amazing ability, sir.

731
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,634
I truly respect you.

732
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,303
That said, allow me
to sing for you, Mr. Yuk.

733
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,721
Goodness.

734
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,932
Mr. Yuk, this song is for you.

735
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,728
-What's this song?
-Jeez.

736
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,982
Jingle, jingle, jingle
Jingle, jingle, jingle

737
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,694
The sound of the bell
On the spotted dog

738
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:55,657
He comes in the morning
To greet me on my way to work

739
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,494
And wags his tail in joy as he follows me

740
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:03,373
Jingle, jingle, jingle
Jingle, jingle, jingle

741
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:07,001
The sound of the bell
On the spotted dog

742
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,253
I love you, Mr. Yuk!

743
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,047
-Thank you.
-Good job!

744
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,884
Gosh, that was a great song.

745
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,179
Ms. Ahn, why don't you sing a song?

746
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,725
What was that look for?

747
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,477
I'm your superior, and I sang,

748
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:26,938
so you can't refuse.

749
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,446
-I'll sing.
-What?

750
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,156
I'm a good singer.

751
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,785
-Sounds good, Ms. Park.
-Very cool!

752
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,996
-Help me out.
-What?

753
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,289
-I said help me out.
-No.

754
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,373
-Nice!
-Help me.

755
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,874
Me? Wait a minute.

756
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,252
-What's going on?
-Are you guys a couple?

757
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,129
How about a hand for the couple?

758
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,298
-They seem close.
-That's great.

759
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,634
They should sing a duet song
like "The Blue in You."

760
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,802
Come on.

761
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,887
-Looking great!
-Let's hear it.

762
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,056
-Good one.
-Looking great, you two.

763
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,688
Let's go!

764
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,315
Great choice!

765
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,151
Cute, so cute

766
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,111
You're so cute when you smile

767
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:18,615
You're the cutest, my love

768
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,867
Cool, so cool

769
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,702
You're so cool

770
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:26,664
That you make my heart skip a beat

771
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,458
Scared, so scared

772
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,792
Your deep eyes

773
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,045
I think I might fall into them

774
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,130
So I've been learning how to swim

775
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,590
Sexy, so sexy

776
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,967
Your collarbone is so sexy

777
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,679
I want to kiss it so much

778
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,014
They look great together.

779
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,475
-They're so cute.
-They should just date.

780
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,191
No way, are you dating?

781
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,277
Are you sure?

782
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,789
Are you two really not dating?

783
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,837
No, we're really not.

784
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,882
Mr. Ha and Ms. Park!

785
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,342
Are you two okay?

786
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,594
You should just date after this.

787
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,472
After this song,
you two will officially be a couple.

788
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,432
Hey, Mr. Ha!

789
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,017
Look at him. He's so tense.

790
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,143
Come on!

791
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,354
Dance with her!

792
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,773
Come on, just take her lead.

793
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,192
-All right!
-You look great together!

794
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,610
Park Mi-gyeong!

795
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,905
I was in such a good mood
that I drank too much.

796
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,117
Get rid of your hangover
before you head home, sir.

797
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,451
Mr. Ma.

798
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,037
Go pick up the hangover cure
that he always takes.

799
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,330
Yes, of course.

800
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:50,998
Hey, Mr. Jeong.

801
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,168
-Mr. Jeong, we need--
-He's not here.

802
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,463
Right, we didn't call him.

803
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,589
Now what?

804
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,133
Hey.

805
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,719
Ms. Ahn.

806
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,389
Can you make a quick run
to the convenience store?

807
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,473
Three bottles.

808
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,276
I'll go.

809
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,528
-I need some cigarettes.
-I need some too.

810
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,613
-I thought you were quitting.
-And coffee milk.

811
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,588
Is it fun?

812
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,926
Toying with my emotions, that is.

813
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,431
I could say the same thing to you.

814
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,519
You still can't
bring yourself to be honest.

815
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,855
Tell me so that I can understand.

816
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,734
Then explain what happened that day.

817
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,779
I've already told you.

818
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,698
-It was because of the balance.
-No, the real reason.

819
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,413
It wasn't that you couldn't come.

820
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,675
You chose not to come.

821
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,106
I saw you.

822
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,155
I saw everything.

823
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,976
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

824
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,747
Su-yeong. Did you feel anything for me?

825
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,916
Has your relationship
with Ms. Ahn evolved?

826
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,585
Have you and Ms. Ahn
turned into archenemies?

827
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,754
Why do you like her?

828
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:25,755
Ms. Ahn.

829
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,549
Let's go somewhere and eat something good.

830
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,010
I wish you would stop drinking soju

831
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,721
whenever you're upset.

832
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,557
Your hand is warm.

833
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,685
Why do you like me?

834
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,146
Sang-su is a good-hearted man.

835
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,565
You two look good together.

836
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,777
Why did you follow me out?

837
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,154
Can I ask you something?

838
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,615
Do you still like me?
