00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,966
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,183
I can't believe it's the new year already.

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,644
I've had nightmares since October
about these calendars.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,148
Even if we roll 5,000 of them,
they're gone in a couple of days.

5
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,526
People always demand calendars
as if they're entitled to them.

6
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,614
News stations need to make it clear

7
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,909
that hanging a bank calendar at home
doesn't make you rich.

8
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,953
Darn it. I tore another one.

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,373
Come on, Mr. Ha.

10
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,210
I could roll gimbap
more quickly than that.

11
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,296
Darn it. I'm going to call it a day.

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,631
I'm clocking out first.

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,468
I'm done too. Wait up.

14
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,719
Good luck, you guys.

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,387
Let's grab a drink soon.

16
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,598
-See you.
-Goodbye.

17
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,385
Sang-su. I have a memorial service.

18
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,098
You never go to those.
Be more creative, will you?

19
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,558
You always use that excuse.

20
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,145
I'm serious this time.
It's for my great-grandmother's cousin's--

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,604
Just go.

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,065
I love you.

23
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,072
I want to become rich too.

24
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,633
Here.

25
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,093
Use this.

26
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,432
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

27
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,068
Patch up your finger,
or else we'll be here all night.

28
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,988
Okay.

29
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,395
Do you want to be rich too?

30
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,316
No, I just want to be average.

31
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,612
That's a rather humble wish, isn't it?

32
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,657
I hear you come from a wealthy family.

33
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,954
Because I graduated
from an elite school in Gangnam

34
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,538
and live in that district?

35
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:17,465
Being average means
you don't stand out from the crowd.

36
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,468
It means you're just like everyone else.

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,598
But growing up,
I felt like the ugly duckling

38
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,559
among all the others around me.

39
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,273
Not that anyone ever said it to my face.

40
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,440
I realized that…

41
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,361
what some people considered average

42
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,616
was hard for people like me to have.
Almost impossible to reach on my own.

43
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,912
When they talk about being average,

44
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,625
it was just their way
of bragging that they're actually not.

45
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,715
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

46
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,972
I didn't bother correcting
any of the exaggerated rumors

47
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,100
because it would prevent me
from being average.

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,943
Take two, then.
And become twice as average.

49
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,711
EPISODE 4

50
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,965
I'm sorry you had to work
all night because of me.

51
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,303
It's the weekend anyway,
so I can sleep in.

52
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,181
Good work, senior clerk.

53
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,685
Wait, you're a section chief now.
I'm sorry that I keep forgetting that.

54
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,814
You worked harder than I did
despite being my senior.

55
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't say that.

56
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,490
You're in a higher position than I am.

57
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,288
Other people don't consider
service reps as their seniors

58
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,998
even if the latter teaches them.

59
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,088
It's because they know
they'll get promoted more quickly.

60
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,177
You taught me everything
during my probation period.

61
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:31,557
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be making mistakes.

62
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,728
My position doesn't matter.

63
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,817
You'll always be my senior and mentor,
no matter what they say.

64
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,831
Do you think the subways are running now?

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,291
Yes.

66
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,796
I should've taken another calendar.

67
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,636
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

68
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,808
Is it fun?
Toying with my emotions, that is.

69
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,812
I could say the same thing to you.

70
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,898
You still can't
bring yourself to be honest.

71
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,900
Tell me so that I can understand.

72
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,654
Then explain what happened that day.

73
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,364
I've already told you.

74
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,617
-It was because of the balance--
-It wasn't that you couldn't come.

75
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,914
You chose not to come.

76
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,852
I saw you.

77
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,357
I saw everything.

78
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,601
You were an hour late,
but you didn't bother to hurry.

79
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,275
"Why is he leaving?"

80
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,028
At first, I didn't understand.

81
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,196
But then…

82
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,240
Hey.

83
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,038
Can we do this again?

84
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,003
I don't like undefined relationships.

85
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,716
"Was it because of what I said?"

86
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,398
I didn't want to believe that.

87
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,650
But the next day, you said…

88
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,193
I had problems yesterday…

89
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,074
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

90
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,076
Did you wait a long time?

91
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,665
"Why did he lie?"

92
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,711
"Why did he hide the fact
that he had arrived there?"

93
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,216
You didn't want me to know.

94
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
You didn't want me to know
that you hesitated.

95
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,266
Am I right?

96
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,770
Why?

97
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,106
Why did you hesitate?

98
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,068
I thought my background
didn't matter to you.

99
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,570
I didn't go to college.

100
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,239
I'm just a teller, and my family is poor.

101
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
Was that why you left?

102
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,412
Or was it because you were going to HQ
and didn't want rumors floating about?

103
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,290
Then you shouldn't have
acted like you were different.

104
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,250
-Was I a joke to you?
-It was the opposite.

105
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,008
I took you seriously.

106
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,097
You weren't someone…

107
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,935
whom I wanted to date on a whim.

108
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,358
I even thought about marrying you.

109
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,614
Then why did you do that?

110
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,492
-Why did you hesitate?
-I don't know.

111
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,494
It wasn't intentional.

112
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,204
It just happened.

113
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,668
But I didn't hesitate for long
and went straight back to you.

114
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,587
But you weren't there.

115
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,467
Exactly.

116
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,511
So I was right.

117
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,221
But I eventually went back.

118
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,557
I might've had some doubts,

119
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,017
-but I still went back.
-You still hesitated.

120
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,394
I didn't mean much to you.

121
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,688
Then why did you act that way?

122
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,024
You saw me heading to the hotel that day.

123
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,778
Why didn't you say anything?
Why give me the cold shoulder?

124
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,783
Why didn't you give me a chance
to explain myself?

125
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,287
-I didn't owe you anything.
-You could've just asked.

126
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,040
You could've confronted me then and there.

127
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,250
We could've talked it out.

128
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,210
What was I supposed to say?

129
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,754
That I deserved to know
exactly why you hesitated?

130
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,635
Being average.

131
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,600
"Did you hesitate…

132
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,564
because dating me would make it
harder for you to become average?"

133
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,609
Is that what you wanted to hear?

134
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,626
Let me ask you one question.

135
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,213
Su-yeong.

136
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,426
Did you feel anything for me?

137
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,349
Was I just…

138
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,977
imagining things?

139
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,736
Yes.

140
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,034
I thought you and I…

141
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,040
were similar.

142
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,085
That's all.

143
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,632
You won't regret this?

144
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,469
No.

145
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,263
And you're not sad…

146
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,266
about anything?

147
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,482
No.

148
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,731
-Mr. Noh.
-Yes, sir.

149
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,738
Will we be able to reach
this year's KPI at this rate?

150
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,364
I'm concerned as well.

151
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:13,287
If our branch receives a D rating,
that'll put you in a tighter spot than me.

152
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,372
You must like your current position.

153
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:21,921
That's why we're currently preparing

154
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,799
an original and innovative spot promotion.

155
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,676
Right, everyone?

156
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,720
We are?

157
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,931
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,810
Our team promises to raise
our performance for the second quarter.

159
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
Once we sort out the companies
that have requested loans,

160
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,066
you'll have nothing to worry about, sir.

161
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,489
Ms. Ahn.

162
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,326
Please stand up.

163
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,293
Applause, please.

164
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,846
She sold every Winner's Plan
for season one.

165
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,809
While others failed
to live up to expectations,

166
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,270
others like Ms. Ahn worked diligently.

167
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,272
That's how our bank

168
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,276
has been able to maintain
this level of performance.

169
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,821
Another round of applause, please.

170
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,791
Now, Ms. Park and Mr. Ha.

171
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,292
Please stand up.

172
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,759
The Youngpo branch
is known for being competitive,

173
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,637
yet their presentation came out on top.

174
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,307
Here's to hoping that they'll be
the final winners of the contest.

175
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,517
Applause, please.

176
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,830
What are you looking for?

177
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,832
Where's the calculator?

178
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,503
I think I saw it on Mr. Ha's desk.

179
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,463
Hey, I'm borrowing this.

180
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,993
This client is coming by later today.

181
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,036
Wait.

182
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,625
The font size is wrong.
It should be 15, not 11.

183
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,752
This client is farsighted

184
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,463
and complains
if the font size is too small.

185
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,342
I thought I told you this multiple times.

186
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,097
The client received
LASIK surgery last month.

187
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,348
I thought you knew.

188
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,692
I see you didn't dispose of
these gift certificates.

189
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,945
I'll get to it after work.

190
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,158
It's important to deal with
old gift certificates immediately.

191
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,203
I told you this multiple times
during your probation period.

192
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,079
It inconveniences others.

193
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,333
I'll make sure it doesn't
interfere with your duties,

194
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,626
so don't worry about it.

195
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,134
What's going on?

196
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,721
Gosh. Why are they so cold to each other?

197
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,725
I didn't know Mr. Ha could be so immature.

198
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,651
Ms. Ahn.

199
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,656
These are either snacks
or some kind of candy.

200
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
It's a gift from a Winner's Plan client.

201
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,787
They signed up today, thanks to you.

202
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
Thank you, sir.

203
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,042
Ms. Ahn, I know how hard you're working.

204
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,170
Are you already preparing for season two?

205
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,132
It doesn't hurt to plan ahead.

206
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,552
Yes, sir. I'll get it ready.

207
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,055
All right. Good luck, then.

208
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,483
It feels nice to get some fresh air.

209
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,902
It really does. I'm famished.

210
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,488
I'm starving too.

211
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,656
Hello, Mr. Jeong!

212
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,367
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

213
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,618
Are you on your way to lunch?

214
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
Please have this for later.

215
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
It's dessert.

216
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,124
Goodness, this is my favorite.

217
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,710
But I'm on a diet.

218
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,297
Thank you.

219
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,507
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

220
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,509
EATING SWEETS WILL CHEER YOU UP

221
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,976
-What do you want?
-How about oyster gukbap?

222
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:51,935
-Oyster gukbap?
-Yes.

223
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,564
Mr. So told me
that it's the best hangover meal ever.

224
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,983
Are you talking about that new restaurant?

225
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,068
-The owner gave us rice cakes.
-Let's go there.

226
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,570
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

227
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,115
I thought they had just opened.

228
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,952
To me…

229
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,664
No, to us. You were already dead to us.

230
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,125
Stop hovering around me.

231
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,879
Let's go somewhere else.

232
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,422
Okay. Let's do that.

233
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,590
-Let's go.
-Okay.

234
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,133
Let's eat something else.

235
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,301
What's around here?

236
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,802
-Fish?
-Jjamppong?

237
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,095
Or maybe…

238
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,891
-Hey.
-What?

239
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,020
How are things
with the FSS vice-president's daughter?

240
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,354
It's going smoothly.

241
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,982
Your face says otherwise.

242
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,279
Hey.

243
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,408
Do you know the lifespan of this bill?

244
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,660
Sixty-one months.

245
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,163
That's five years and a month.

246
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,209
Jeong-eun and I
didn't even last that long.

247
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,587
What does that mean?
Are you happy now or what?

248
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,800
I gave up on any romantic feelings,
so everything is going well.

249
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,301
Our parents are happy too.

250
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,514
Thanks to this woman,

251
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,141
I realized how tiring it was
to be considerate.

252
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,561
My relationship with Jeong-eun
was uncomfortable.

253
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,606
It's really uncomfortable
to be mindful of others.

254
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,151
Hold on a second.

255
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,780
Hello, Ji-eun. Yes, I'm eating right now.

256
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,324
Yes. A ballet performance?

257
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,617
That sounds great.

258
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,244
Sure.

259
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,538
Yes, of course.

260
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,580
Jeez.

261
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,834
What about you?

262
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,922
Has your relationship
with Ms. Ahn evolved?

263
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,175
Have you and Ms. Ahn
turned into archenemies?

264
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,636
Jeez.

265
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,473
Whatever it is, just cut it out.
It's getting awkward.

266
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,688
I've always been curious.

267
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,357
Why do you like her?

268
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,861
I don't like her.

269
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,949
Let me rephrase. Why did you like her?

270
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,580
Should we drink today?

271
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,541
-Let's burn through our paychecks.
-I'm taking a half day.

272
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,542
Why?

273
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,671
I have a memorial service.

274
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,674
You jerk. That's my go-to excuse.

275
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,650
Su-yeong.

276
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,777
What are you doing here?

277
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,700
How intriguing.

278
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,952
Right?

279
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,498
What are you doing after work today?

280
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,708
Care to have a drink?

281
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,569
FATHER OF HA SANG-SU,
HA DONG-SIK

282
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,768
I didn't know you smoked.

283
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,648
This was one of your dad's belongings.

284
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,776
He didn't get to smoke much
before passing away.

285
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,698
I smoke once a year
on the anniversary of his death.

286
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,368
I told myself I'd only resent him
until I finished this pack.

287
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,037
And now, I'm done.

288
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,666
I don't have an excuse
to resent him anymore.

289
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,172
You didn't have to come for this,
especially with that long face.

290
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
You were different even as a young boy.

291
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,723
Other kids would whine
and beg their parents

292
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,392
to buy them video games or shoes.

293
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,520
But you carried the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

294
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,731
You never asked for anything.

295
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:52,110
You never once let on
that you were struggling or in pain.

296
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,405
When you had a high fever,
you went to the hospital alone.

297
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,699
I only found out after you had recovered.

298
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,787
And then, for the first time,

299
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,665
you wanted to do something,
and it was ice hockey.

300
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,794
To be honest,

301
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,672
I wanted to keep playing.

302
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,215
But I lied

303
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,718
and said it was boring.

304
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,887
I knew that, of course.

305
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,264
I knew about it then,

306
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,808
and I also know
that you still play for fun.

307
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,940
Your eyes lit up whenever you saw
a hockey uniform, even at that age.

308
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
You were lying through your teeth.

309
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,278
I just feigned ignorance.

310
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,655
You weren't planning on going pro,

311
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,117
and I thought it was a way
for you to make friends.

312
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,209
I have nothing to be sorry for.

313
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,962
I really did my best to raise you well.

314
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,465
I'm proud of myself.

315
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,095
I agree. I'm proud of you too.

316
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,182
Then don't make me feel bad
for raising you like that.

317
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,936
Try acting out or being immature for once.

318
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,272
Go on dates,
get into relationships, and get married.

319
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,192
Get divorced, too, if you want.

320
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,030
Don't take things so seriously.

321
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,159
Let's go.

322
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,287
I won't be coming back here from now on.

323
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,706
I won't visit your dad anymore.

324
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,001
That's okay. You deserve that right.

325
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,753
Sang-su.

326
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,007
You're happy, right?

327
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,650
My definition of happiness
is not having any regrets.

328
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,985
They all helped me.

329
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,361
Now I just need yours.

330
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,697
Press your seal here.

331
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,032
If only I had stopped my dad back then.

332
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,994
Thank you so much.

333
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,624
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

334
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
OVERDUE PAYMENT REMINDER

335
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,632
-I'm home, Dad.
-Okay, good.

336
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,844
If only I hadn't let him go.

337
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,928
Dad.

338
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,149
If only I had gotten to him sooner.

339
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,817
It was a car accident.

340
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,611
Are you sure about that?

341
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,488
-It wasn't suicide?
-Hush, now.

342
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,281
My gosh, they'll hear you.

343
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,075
A person's death

344
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,454
changes the lives of those
whom they leave behind.

345
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,424
Because their death becomes…

346
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,719
a shackle for us.

347
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,058
People who carry life's burdens…

348
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,269
always hold back.

349
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,023
And they always hesitate.

350
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,067
Why?

351
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,779
Why did you hesitate?

352
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,617
But somehow,
all of the decisions I've made…

353
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,374
never brought me closer to happiness.

354
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,272
-How about this table?
-Sure.

355
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,572
Roata '08 Vin, please.

356
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,949
I'm afraid we don't have any on hand.

357
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,451
Would you like to try something else?

358
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,204
Really? Then maybe…

359
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,624
I know a place that has that wine.

360
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,943
How about we pair this wine with jamón?

361
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,405
Anything is fine.

362
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,700
This is it, right? You must like dry wine.

363
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,411
Here. Let me help.

364
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,495
Forget it.

365
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,624
Opening wine bottles
is my only forte, so let me do it.

366
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,792
Just look around in the meantime.

367
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,632
Those are my failed marquage projects.

368
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,968
I see.

369
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,279
Just work on a new bag.
That one's a lost cause.

370
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,739
I'll give it a try.

371
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,542
You're pretty good, Su-yeong.
Did you study art?

372
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm not that good.

373
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,884
What's going on with you and Sang-su?

374
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,178
Things have been weird with you two.

375
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,856
Do you like Mr. Ha?

376
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,983
What?

377
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,197
Yes. Is it that obvious?

378
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,408
A little.

379
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,494
I just can't hide my feelings.

380
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,958
Can I ask why you like him?

381
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,340
I wonder what you see in him.

382
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,474
Because he's a constant.

383
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,519
He's not a variable
that's affected by a given situation.

384
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,439
He always maintains the same value.

385
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,107
Like a constant.

386
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,985
He was always careful
when it came to dating

387
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,528
ever since college.

388
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:38,951
He knows the gravity of one's feelings,
so he takes it very seriously.

389
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,162
And he's always thoughtful.

390
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,833
So I was right.

391
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,794
But I eventually went back.

392
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,921
I might've had some doubts,

393
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,672
but I still went back.

394
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,050
Once he makes up his mind
about dating someone,

395
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,471
I think he'll absolutely cherish her.

396
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:06,562
When we go somewhere to eat,
he casually sets the cutlery for me.

397
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,899
If my glass is empty,
he fills it up before I know it.

398
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,987
But isn't that just an act of kindness?

399
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,782
He notices which side dishes I eat

400
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,743
and doesn't have any himself
so that I can have it all.

401
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,497
I consider that innate talent.

402
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,376
His thoughtfulness puts me at ease.

403
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,838
It's not something
you can force yourself to learn.

404
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,673
I know this for a fact.

405
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,802
Sang-su is a good-hearted man.

406
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,267
You two look good together.

407
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,529
Su-yeong, take this.

408
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,408
No, I can't. It's too expensive.

409
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,120
I changed my mind
about throwing this one away.

410
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,205
So instead, I'll give you this one.

411
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,292
But still…

412
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,961
It's so pretty and looks good on you.

413
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,760

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,128
Thank you.

420
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,800
Ms. Ahn.

421
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,015
Yes.

422
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,019
I got all the medicine.
I didn't forget any.

423
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,357
Gosh, stop worrying.
Seriously, I eat just fine.

424
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,236
How were the avocados? Did you like them?

425
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,280
What do you mean?
That's how they normally taste.

426
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,117
Why won't you listen to me
when I tell you to get a smartphone?

427
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,246
I'll teach you how to use it.
It'll only take a day.

428
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,206
Yes.

429
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,250
I'll send it over right now.

430
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,669
Okay. Bye.

431
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,966
You speak in dialect.

432
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,928
Only when I'm talking to my dad.
You can't tell otherwise, right?

433
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,055
No, I can totally tell.

434
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,807
Really?

435
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,019
So what? I'm from Tongyeong,
so I speak in dialect too.

436
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,563
Really? Let me hear it. I'm curious.

437
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,197
What are you looking at?

438
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,631
CONTACTLESS PARCEL

439
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,685
You didn't need to help.
Thank you, though.

440
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,396
It'd be more convenient
if they used internet banking.

441
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,066
They don't have smartphones
and can't order things online.

442
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,901
But still…

443
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,989
Aren't you worried
that the cash could get stolen?

444
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,492
They wait outside all day long
whenever I send a parcel.

445
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,709
Isn't it difficult for you
to send them your paycheck?

446
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,422
It is. But that's why I like it.

447
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,970
If I work hard, I'll be able to take
cabs instead of buses one day.

448
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,890
I'll be able to go to a hospital
instead of a pharmacy.

449
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,102
And I'll also be able to order
more expensive meals as well.

450
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,610
You have such a big heart, Mr. Jeong,

451
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,320
unlike me.

452
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,239
I don't want to regret it later on.

453
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,076
The worst punishment for kids
who don't tend to their parents

454
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,535
is having to look in the mirror.

455
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,746
It's because as time goes by,

456
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,248
we realize how much
we resemble our parents.

457
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,461
If anything, I'm doing this for myself.

458
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,681
Just a second.

459
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,319
Do you want to take a walk?
I'll carry your groceries.

460
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,614
That's okay. I can carry my own.

461
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,910
You said you hadn't eaten yet.
You should go home and eat.

462
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,496
I can have a light dinner. Hold on.

463
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:57,413
RECEIPT

464
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:09,508
END-OF-THE-DAY DISCOUNT

465
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,111
Let's go somewhere and eat something good.

466
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,156
Today is our payday, after all.

467
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,453
DESIGNATED PARKING SPACE

468
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,541
Hello, ma'am.

469
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,584
Hello.

470
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,674
Is the branch manager in?

471
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,220
Do you mean Mr. Yuk?
Do you have an appointment?

472
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,890
Ma'am?

473
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,642
Hello, ma'am. This way, please.

474
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,858
Hey.

475
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,736
I can't believe you didn't recognize her.

476
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,571
Who is she?

477
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,033
You'll never climb up the ladder now,
that's for sure.

478
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,620
That's Mr. Yuk's wife.

479
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,054
Would you like some coffee?

480
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,180
-Sure.
-Okay.

481
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,351
He's my role model.

482
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:46,272
As men, we need to marry the right woman.

483
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,484
I wonder what your future wife did
that was so wrong

484
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,195
to end up getting married
to someone like you, Mr. Ma.

485
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,906
Would you like
to find out yourself? Really?

486
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,534
They say the more money you have,
the more elegant you become.

487
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,119
She sure sets an example.

488
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,080
I think that applies to Ms. Park as well.

489
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,418
There's an AI finance
training session this week.

490
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,421
One person from each team will go.

491
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,506
I went last time.

492
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,971
I have a workshop to attend
at my kid's international school.

493
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,141
I'll go.

494
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,809
Really?

495
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,398
Sang-su, you went last time,
so Mr. Ma will attend this session.

496
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,983
Yes, sir.

497
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,822
Sang-su, would you like
to go instead of me?

498
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,534
I'm sorry, but I have plans this week.

499
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,835
Here's some chamomile tea.

500
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,378
Thank you.

501
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,132
Didn't you say your son
works at a bank as well?

502
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,426
Yes. He's a section chief.

503
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,428
My daughter is an assistant manager.

504
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,764
Which bank?

505
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,515
KCU Bank.

506
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,726
Goodness. Which branch?

507
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,230
My daughter works there too
over at the Youngpo branch.

508
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,695
My son's branch
is in a province down south.

509
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,156
I see.

510
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,075
What a coincidence.

511
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,682
Just a little something.

512
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,977
-Thank you.
-How's it going?

513
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,437
You seem to have a lot to do.

514
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,566
This isn't my specialty,
so I'm struggling a bit.

515
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,861
That's what makes you impressive.
You're challenging yourself.

516
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,072
Thanks for the encouragement.

517
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,367
I should study hard too
if I want to succeed like you.

518
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,036
I know you'll pass your exam.

519
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,336
Are you going to eat?

520
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,171
No, I'm fine.

521
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,049
I told you not to overdo it,
but here you are.

522
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,343
I want to do this. It's fun.

523
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,680
Su-yeong, I want to take you somewhere.

524
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,601
So you'll give us a call
and book your next appointment?

525
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,645
-Yes. I'll call you.
-Okay.

526
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,856
Hello.

527
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,316
Goodness. Why are you here at this hour?

528
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,610
Did the bank close early today?

529
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,029
No, I just made some time to stop by.

530
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,824
Aqua care service for two, please.

531
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,993
Okay. I'll get the room ready.

532
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,494
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

533
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,745
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

534
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,916
Did you say two? Who's the other person?

535
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,501
Just go, Mom.

536
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,503
Is it a guy?

537
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,715
Do you seriously think
I'd bring a guy to a place you frequent?

538
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,133
Why not?

539
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,011
Just go home. Go on.

540
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,889
Goodness, you're so mean.

541
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,182
See you.

542
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,900
Here, let me.

543
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,109
I can do it.

544
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,487
That'll leave marks in your hair.

545
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,655
This hair tie is much better.

546
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,917
Before working at KCU, I thought
my friends were the worst type of people.

547
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,462
All they did was spend
their parents' money

548
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,506
and did whatever they wanted.

549
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,258
I got a job because I didn't
want to live like that.

550
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,262
But I've met just as many at the bank.

551
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,098
You two must be colleagues.

552
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,893
Yes, I recently transferred
to this branch.

553
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,689
You're both so lovely.
You must be very popular.

554
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,025
She's the most popular one.

555
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,654
That must be nice.

556
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,448
Not at all.

557
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,660
Yeon-ju.

558
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,578
-Begin the cleansing process.
-Okay.

559
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,247
LOCKER ROOM

560
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,169
Don't you feel better now?

561
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,380
I do.

562
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,513
Let's get going, Sang-su.

563
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,639
Mi-gyeong.

564
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,141
Can we do dinner next time?

565
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,227
No.

566
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,480
I have something to tell you. It's urgent.

567
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,279
I like you, Sang-su.

568
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:56,081
I know you take what I say seriously,
so I'll give you some time to think.

569
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,377
One.

570
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,004
Two.

571
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:03,964
Three.

572
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,844
So did you give it some thought?

573
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,890
Just kidding.

574
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,354
But really, though.
Please think about what I said.

575
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
Why?

576
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,496
Why do you like me?

577
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,842
You're someone I want to have.

578
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,019
You're different from other men I know.

579
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,399
Then you shouldn't have
acted like you were different.

580
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,651
Was I a joke to you?

581
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,825
You don't have to be
completely sure about how you feel.

582
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,786
At least for now.

583
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,248
You still hesitated.

584
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,501
I didn't mean much to you.

585
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,339
I thought you and I…

586
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,386
were similar.

587
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,556
After all, we're similar to each other.

588
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,362
Let me ask you one question.

589
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,448
Su-yeong.

590
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,620
Did you feel anything for me?

591
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,084
No.

592
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,236
INNOVATIVE APP CONTEST
AWARD CEREMONY

593
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,863
One, two, three.

594
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,948
MOBILE APP IDEA CONTEST
KCU BANK PRESIDENT AWARD

595
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,163
Where's my compliment?

596
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,790
I really did my best.

597
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,378
Good job, Mi-gyeong.

598
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,474
What? It's just
a congratulatory handshake.

599
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,187
Your hand is warm.

600
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,656
Let's give them another round of applause.

601
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,455
In my 20 years of working in this field,
this is the first time

602
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,874
I've seen anyone
whom I know win this contest.

603
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,710
Sang-su, you'll be headed to HQ soon.

604
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,797
This is all thanks to Ms. Park.

605
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,132
Not at all. Mr. Ha did all the work.

606
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,302
Do I smell love in the air?

607
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:41,223
Can we expect a wedding invite
by the end of the year?

608
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,561
And Ms. Ahn, please come to my office.

609
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,105
Well done.

610
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,857
Let's wrap up here.

611
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,990
Maybe he's going to let you
take over the next product.

612
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,951
Congratulations.

613
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,661
Nothing has been set yet.

614
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,502
Su-yeong.

615
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,546
Yes, Ms. Park?

616
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,966
Never mind. Carry on.

617
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,968
Okay.

618
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,853
I don't understand.

619
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,360
I want you to hand over
the Winner's Plan project to Ms. Park.

620
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,990
I thought I was to prepare for season two.

621
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,160
That, of course, goes to Ms. Park.

622
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,540
It was her job to begin with,
and she's far better at it than you.

623
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,585
You've been a huge help to us.

624
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,254
Thanks to the solid groundwork
you laid out,

625
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,672
we felt secure about the project.

626
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,340
In that case,

627
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:02,095
what duties will I be given next?

628
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,223
You'll do what you've always been doing.

629
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,601
Being the top-performing teller
at this branch.

630
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,565
Goodness.

631
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,484
Ms. Ahn.

632
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,322
Hello, sir.

633
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,115
Yes, of course.

634
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,075
I see.

635
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,680
Su-yeong.

636
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:55,649
Mr. Yuk wants me to hand over
the Winner's Plan project material to you.

637
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,613
I was going to give it to you later,
but can I hand it over now?

638
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,997
I did my best,
but it may look a bit unpolished.

639
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,585
I learned a lot from you. Thank you.

640
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,757
I'm sorry, Su-yeong.
I know how much effort you put into this.

641
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,428
That's okay. It's not your fault anyway.

642
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,139
Don't worry about it.

643
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,733
Gosh.

644
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,277
How could he make such a fool out of her?

645
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,446
He shouldn't have led her on

646
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,782
and said she'd take over
the next new product.

647
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,244
Why did he have to give her false hope?

648
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,664
The poor thing
was barking up the wrong tree.

649
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,958
There's only so far
she could go in her position.

650
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,793
She got too greedy.

651
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,380
Exactly. She should've just
focused on being a teller like Ji-yun.

652
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:33,204
SOJU

653
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:45,050
I wish you would stop drinking soju
whenever you're upset.

654
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:52,557
I thought I was well-aware
that not everyone in this world is given

655
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:59,105
equal shares of time, opportunities,
happiness, and love.

656
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,190
But I was wrong.

657
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:08,114
This life is like a zero-sum game.
One's happiness is another's misfortune.

658
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,369
No matter how hard I try,
it's just out of my reach.

659
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,794
It's pretty foolish of me
to have such false hope, right?

660
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,842
Do I look like a fool to you?

661
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,890
I work at a bank,
but I'm not affiliated with it.

662
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,476
I'm a security guard
who does a lot of menial work.

663
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,478
365 ATM

664
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,605
I get paid by a hiring-service company.

665
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,648
TRANSACTION HISTORY

666
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,276
I feel like an outsider on payday.
Do you know how that feels?

667
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,281
But despite all that,
I don't think I'm a fool.

668
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,368
It doesn't bother me
when people mistreat me,

669
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,454
or look down on me
for being a contract worker.

670
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:02,043
I have a dream,
so I know things will get better.

671
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,507
So you're not foolish at all.

672
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,765
I grew up in an area
that doesn't even show up on the map.

673
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,520
Five years ago,
I thought I'd become a farmer like my dad.

674
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:24,441
But look at me now.
I work at a reputable bank in Seoul.

675
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,447
In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

676
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,158
It'll be unimaginable.

677
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:43,710
We're going to become happier
since we're trying our best.

678
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,840
ASSISTANT MANAGER PARK MI-GYEONG

679
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,010
I put a necklace in your bag
this morning as a surprise gift.

680
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,681
I know this isn't the best timing,
but I want to say thank you and sorry.

681
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,194
Do you want it?

682
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,821
No, really. You don't have to.

683
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:58,785
Okay, then I'll take it
after you've worn it for a very long time.

684
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,549
KCU BANK AI FINANCE TRAINING

685
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,730
Hello.

686
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,398
Hello.

687
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,738
It's called artificial intelligence.

688
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,076
AI technology demonstrates human intellect

689
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,955
such as thinking and learning
through the use of computers.

690
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,833
Simply put, computers use collected data…

691
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,654
-Take this!
-Take this!

692
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,406
-Hey!
-Hi!

693
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,116
What's next? Hurry up and choose!

694
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,660
-Let's do it.
-Let's play a game…

695
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,920
I'm Mr. Kang from the Dangsang branch.

696
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:01,384
Gosh, I've only heard
about the Goddess of Youngpo.

697
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,761
I thought people were exaggerating,

698
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,931
but you're even more beautiful
than they say.

699
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,142
Let me pour you a drink.

700
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,310
Okay.

701
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,446
You're much more laid-back than I thought.

702
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,990
-Can I pour you a drink too?
-Sure.

703
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,074
Hey…

704
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,416
-Do you want one?
-Sure.

705
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,209
-Did you drink much?
-Not at all.

706
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,087
You shouldn't drink too much.

707
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,848
Now that you've won the contest,

708
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,768
it's only a matter of time
before you move to HQ.

709
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,978
You're so good at your job.

710
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,732
I didn't do it alone.
I did it with Ms. Park.

711
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,941
I know.

712
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:03,070
She used to work at the Seocho branch.
I hear she's richer now than before.

713
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:08,826
Marrying her would guarantee you
a better future than transferring to HQ.

714
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,662
Gosh, I hope I can meet a woman like her.

715
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,040
Your wife's background
shapes who you are these days.

716
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,374
Mr. Ha.

717
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,585
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

718
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,964
All right, cheers to us too.

719
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,174
We can do it.

720
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,717
We can do it!

721
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,452
Why do you like her?

722
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,291
Because…

723
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,797
she never says no.

724
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:09,679
No matter how hard, complicated,
or trivial the task may be,

725
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,682
she never once says no.

726
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,976
-That must be heavy.
-She just works hard.

727
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,435
It's okay. I can do it.

728
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,777
The tougher things get,
the more nonchalant she acts.

729
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,618
She reminds me of myself.

730
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,541
She makes me want to root for her.

731
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,863
Why did you follow me out?

732
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,537
How long have you been following me?

733
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,626
Let's head back now.

734
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,545
It's dangerous to be out this late.

735
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,088
What's it to you?

736
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,552
Ms. Ahn.

737
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,140
It's Ms. Ahn one minute
and Su-yeong the next.

738
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,978
It's so simple for you. Isn't it, Mr. Ha?

739
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,822
Can I ask you something?

740
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,286
Why did you come?

741
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,962
You told Mr. Ma that you had plans.

742
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,215
So why did you come?

743
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,058
Do you still like me?

744
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,357
What for?

745
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,822
It's not like you'll do anything about it.

746
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,327
Then what about you?

747
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,374
Why are you still so mad at me?

748
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,670
Was my moment of hesitation…

749
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,965
that unforgivable?

750
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,929
I thought you had no feelings for me.

751
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,391
Did you really…

752
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,774
Did you really think…

753
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,155
I had absolutely no feelings for you?

754
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,962
JEONG JONG-HYEON

755
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,308
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

756
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,746
If I had kept my promise
that day at the hotel…

757
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,206
would you have dated me?

758
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,792
Do you want to meet tonight for a bit?

759
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,086
Sang-su seems weird, right?

760
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,296
I told him that I liked him.

761
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,383
So are you two dating now?

762
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,177
He's completely bullying her.

763
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,763
It's a choice she made.

764
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,350
Can you buy me a drink, Sang-su?

765
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,519
Here's a hangover cure.

766
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,984
Are you all right?
