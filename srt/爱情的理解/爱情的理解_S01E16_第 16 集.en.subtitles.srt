THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,736
You can withdraw during the period.

3
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,364
But it's necessary
that you maintain it for three years

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,284
to be tax-exempt.

5
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,330
It'd be better to keep this account
for at least three years.

6
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,792
Darn it. I'm gaining more weight with age.

7
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,212
Sang-su, maybe
you can teach me how to play hockey.

8
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,338
Have you skated before?

9
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,256
Yes, when I was little.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,050
At those old roller rinks?

11
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,595
Do you think I'm that old?

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,652
-Hello.
-Hi.

13
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,905
You should stop by the bank sometime.

14
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,117
Mr. Ha, you became an assistant manager!

15
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,911
Hold on for a second.

16
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,704
-That's okay.
-No.

17
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,040
Take some of this home.

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,000
Gosh. Thank you.

19
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,252
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

20
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,461
-Thank you.
-No worries.

21
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,046
-I'll stop by soon.
-Okay.

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,596
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO FORGET?

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,641
THINGS THAT I WANT TO REMEMBER FOREVER

24
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,912
Some nights,
I forget about her completely.

25
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,002
But on other nights,
I can see her clearly.

26
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,298
And just like that,

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,759
four years passed by.

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,394
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

29
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,942
FINALE

30
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,070
Hello?

31
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,113
Goodness!

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,494
Be careful. You're due any moment now.

33
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,789
This is my third one.
Don't worry. I won't give birth here.

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,625
-Is everyone here?
-They're in their seats.

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,501
Mr. Lee is taking care of the groom.

36
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:35,256
Gosh. What's gotten into him?
I guess he finally grew up.

37
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,342
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

38
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,262
My goodness. Those turned out great!

39
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,990
Did you get your makeup done?

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,369
I don't need it.

41
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,080
Why not? You should look good.

42
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,876
If you're ready, shall we get going?

43
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,519
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union

44
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,855
of Ma Du-sik and Bae Eun-jeong.

45
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,609
Please give a big round of applause
to the very happy couple.

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,488
Please welcome the bride and groom.

47
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,510
For four years,
they went through the drama

48
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,637
of breaking up and getting back together.

49
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,472
But now they're married.

50
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,226
I'm more surprised
that you're still a bachelor, Mr. Lee.

51
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,227
Is that so?

52
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,397
I'm more shocked that
you're pregnant with your third child.

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,232
Trying to win an award
for having many kids?

54
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,942
Watch what you say.

55
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,322
I have severe mood swings at the moment
because of my hormones.

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,826
And I'm depressed,
thanks to being on maternity leave.

57
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,537
Mr. Ha, it's been a while.
Have you been well?

58
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,248
Yes. Congratulations on your pregnancy.

59
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,293
Are you at the Sangan branch?

60
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm going to the Yeomnam branch next week.

61
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,797
The Yeomnam branch?

62
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,674
I know someone who works there.

63
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,719
She got a position transfer and moved
to the General Consultation Team.

64
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,387
I see.

65
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,267
What about you, Mr. So?

66
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,270
I'm still at the Youngpo branch.

67
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,735
I don't think human resources
know that you exist, Gyeong-pil.

68
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,988
I mean, how else could he stay
in one place for so long?

69
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,199
My goal is to become a branch manager.

70
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,995
The food is good,

71
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
but I'm craving galbitang.

72
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,417
Didn't you have breakfast,
Deputy Manager Noh?

73
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,800
I saw this coming,
so I wore my new name tag.

74
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,010
It's so small. Is it legible? Look.

75
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:26,969
"Branch Manager Noh."

76
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,390
Your wife must be ecstatic
that you got a promotion.

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,102
She's making me breakfast again.

78
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,312
The last time she did that
was when we were newlyweds.

79
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,318
So how have you been, Si-gyeong?

80
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,032
What?

81
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,577
He retired ages ago.

82
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,871
I can't keep calling him
Branch Manager Yuk.

83
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,289
I'm the new branch manaâ€¦

84
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:00,294
It'd be weird
to address him any other way.

85
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,587
Is that okay with you?

86
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,005
Of course.

87
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,509
I've been interested
in doing housework these days.

88
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,636
It suits me surprisingly well.

89
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,475
It's wonderful to see everyone
from the Youngpo branch again.

90
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,228
-Let's enjoy the meal.
-Yes, enjoy.

91
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,938
Goodness.

92
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,773
Thank you for coming.

93
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,275
Youngpo branch forever!

94
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,651
-Forever!
-Forever!

95
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,446
Congratulations on getting married.

96
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,407
Thanks to my promotion,
I was able to give you

97
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,325
a substantial amount
of congratulatory money.

98
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,120
-Thank you, Branch Manager Noh.
-Don't mention it.

99
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,413
I'm starving.

100
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
I can't do this whole wedding again.

101
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,751
Were you planning to get married twice?

102
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,587
Depends on how well you do.

103
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,174
But where's Assistant Manager Park?

104
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,594
Isn't she a manager now?

105
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
That's right.

106
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,806
Everyone's getting promoted except for me.

107
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,184
Wait, so did she not come today?

108
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
What?

109
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,605
What's the matter?

110
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,110
Goodness, are you uncomfortable, Mr. Ha?

111
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,156
Why would he be uncomfortable seeing her?

112
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,329
Right. They used to be in a relationship.

113
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,749
I'm fine.

114
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,043
See? That was years ago.

115
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,338
Did you not invite Ms. Ahn?

116
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
Have you lost touch
with her after she quit?

117
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,432
Soâ€¦ Enjoy the food.

118
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,893
-Okay.
-We'll come back later.

119
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,394
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

120
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,522
-Please, help yourself.
-Will do!

121
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,240
You'd better go, okay?

122
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,244
Today will be the last time I go.

123
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,537
Hey.

124
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,249
I feel a sense of guilt toward you.

125
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,668
Doing this once a year
is my way of making amends.

126
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
I don't want to hear it.

127
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,630
Come to Seok-hyeon's place tonight.

128
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,215
I'll have to see.

129
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,550
Good luck.

130
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,468
-See you.
-Bye.

131
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,934
Mi-gyeong!

132
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,022
-Good to see you!
-Hey!

133
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,526
-How have you been?
-I've been well. You?

134
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,573
My name is pretty common.

135
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:38,995
From now on,
whenever you hear the name "Mi-gyeong"

136
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,456
or see a 500-won coinâ€¦

137
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,168
you'll feel bad for me.

138
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,432
It's been a long time.

139
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,516
-Hi!
-Hi!

140
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,018
-Are you here for the wedding?
-Yes.

141
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,644
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

142
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,062
-It's been so long.
-I know.

143
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,625
Long time no see.

144
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,131
Why are you so late?
Everyone's been waiting for you.

145
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,968
One of my inspections ended late.

146
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:36,886
I see.

147
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,765
You even work on weekends.
HQ life must be different.

148
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,393
How did you know that I work at HQ now?

149
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,191
Let's go inside.

150
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,526
Sang-su just left.

151
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,987
Should I call him?

152
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,742
That's okay. He's just an ex.

153
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,962
So you went to Seogwang University?

154
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,256
Yes.

155
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,509
I used to visit your school often.

156
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,679
I used to go there with my ex.

157
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:33,150
The coffee here is bitter.
Does it taste okay to you?

158
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm not very picky with coffee.
I just drink whatever.

159
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,034
It's nice that you're not the picky type.

160
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,123
My ex used to be
very particular about coffee.

161
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,218
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do this.

162
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,431
I only showed up
because my friend insisted on it.

163
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,226
But I don't think
I'm ready to start a new relationship.

164
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,771
Okay.

165
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,790
Let's meet up every now and then.

166
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,042
We may be apart, but we're still a family.

167
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,794
Let's go for round two, then.

168
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,089
I have plans today. Maybe next time. Bye.

169
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,382
-Bye.
-Bye.

170
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,550
-Take care.
-Bye.

171
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,635
-It was nice.
-I'm in the parking lot.

172
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,887
-Bye.
-This was so nice.

173
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,850
Aren't you leaving?

174
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,227
I should.

175
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,069
Do you know
what Su-yeong is up to nowadays?

176
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:01,864
No, I don't.

177
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,911
You're fine without seeing Sang-su,

178
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,829
but you're curious about her.

179
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,874
I guess so.

180
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,544
It's strange, but I think about her
every now and then.

181
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,715
Bye.

182
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,092
See you next time.

183
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,136
Okay.

184
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,821
Aren't you transferring to another branch?

185
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,950
You should get ready for that
instead of coming here.

186
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,621
It's better
to get rid of the boxes when you can.

187
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,333
I hate seeing you doing that
when you're all dressed up.

188
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,424
You're such a great guy.
I wonder why you're still single.

189
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,688
Have you still not gotten over that lady?

190
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,855
Who?

191
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,402
That was years ago.

192
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,153
Never mind, then.

193
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,949
Can you organize
the storage room while you're at it?

194
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,904
Excuse me. One cup of lemon tea, please.

195
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,328
One minute, please.

196
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,668
-Yes?
-Hey, come save me!

197
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,795
Seok-hyeon won't let me go home again.

198
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,922
Sang-su, where are you? Hurry up.

199
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,676
Just go home.
You don't have to listen to him.

200
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,137
I heard you got rejected
by your blind date today.

201
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,014
Just come here and have a drink.

202
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,523
I saw Mr. Ha today.

203
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,154
It was Mr. Ma and Ms. Bae's wedding today.

204
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,742
I see.

205
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,704
How is everyone?

206
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,289
They haven't changed one bit.

207
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,459
They were curious about you.

208
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,756
But I didn't tell them anything.
I promised you that I wouldn't.

209
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,014
Aren't you curious about

210
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,391
how he's doing?

211
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,436
You haven't asked me once.

212
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,691
I think of him sometimes.

213
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,778
I like that I can reminisce about him.

214
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,282
Right.

215
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,287
Not all love has to come true.

216
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,416
And you tend to think more fondly
about that kind of love.

217
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,212
But if that love comes true,
then the person you were most fond of

218
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:31,884
suddenly becomes
the biggest nuisance in your life.

219
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,178
Goodness. Look.

220
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,931
It's kicking me for bad-mouthing its dad.

221
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,892
What do you think you're doing?

222
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,353
Gosh.

223
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,647
This place is nice.

224
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,818
The vibe reminds me of you.

225
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,488
I bet the security deposit is pretty high.

226
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,991
They want to increase it this year.

227
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,661
That means you'll have to visit a bank.

228
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,748
Yes. I'll need to take out a loan.

229
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,792
I see.

230
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,339
Then you'll probably go
to the Yeomnam branch nearby.

231
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,883
Yes.

232
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,017
Goodness, I should get going.

233
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,186
I need to pack
for the postpartum care center.

234
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,355
There's so much to prepare.

235
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,773
Let me get you a cab.

236
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,067
Thanks. Gosh.

237
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,992
Stop drinking. You're moving tomorrow.

238
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,829
Sang-su and I need to go home too.

239
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,457
Should I order some tangsuyuk?

240
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,836
I'm done eating.

241
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,547
Then have a drink.

242
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,174
Snap out of it, you idiot.

243
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,385
How long will you keep this up?

244
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,928
Why did you hit me?

245
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,306
It's bad enough
that my mom hits me, damn it!

246
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,476
I'm leaving.

247
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,980
Where are you going?

248
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,862
Take out the recycling.

249
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,828
I barely managed to sell
my newlywed house after four years,

250
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,913
and now I'm moving to a one-room studio!

251
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,957
Take pity on me and just do it.

252
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,717
A past love leaves behind traces.

253
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,316
It makes you regret
not making certain decisions.

254
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,786
But it also makes you regret
the decisions you made.

255
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,836
The pain isn't unbearable.

256
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,014
But it hurts when you least expect it,
like a wound

257
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,394
that won't heal.

258
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,315
The pain is always there.

259
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,915
Yes, I'm on my way.

260
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,167
Okay.

261
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
All right. I'll see you soon.

262
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,797
Okay.

263
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,007
Excuse me.

264
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,263
I'm sorry.

265
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,786
DRAWING CAFÃ‰
FUTURE HAPPINESS

266
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,592
Hello.

267
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,136
Hello.

268
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,915
Would you like to draw?

269
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,585
-Sorry?
-You can just color if you want.

270
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,046
Everyone is welcome to draw.

271
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,468
Maybe next time.
I was on my way to work.

272
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691
By the way,

273
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,736
what does the name of this cafÃ© mean?

274
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,119
Never mind. I like the name.

275
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,834
Hello, how may I help you?

276
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,461
I'd like to take out a loan.

277
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,341
Please take a number and wait inside.

278
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,425
Thank you.

279
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,193
Hello, how may I help you?

280
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,363
I need to take out
an additional deposit loan.

281
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,574
An additional deposit loan?

282
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,797
I'm sorry. I've only just started
working in the loan division.

283
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,842
It's okay. Take your time.

284
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,064
Once the paperwork gets filed,
the inspection will take place.

285
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,984
The deposit amount
will be decided afterward.

286
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,402
Okay. Thank you.

287
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,116
This is for our VIP clients.
Please take one.

288
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,542
I'm sorry you had to wait.

289
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,422
That's okay. Thank you.

290
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,947
This is Assistant Manager Ha Sang-su
from the Sangan branch.

291
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,367
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ha Sang-su.

292
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,620
-Hello.
-Hello.

293
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,039
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

294
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,093
Hello. I'm Ji-yun's friend.

295
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,807
She told me about you.
I heard you got the position transfer.

296
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,184
I transferred recently,
so I'm still pretty lost.

297
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,936
I hope you can help me out.

298
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,521
Okay. I will.

299
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,155
-Hello.
-Thank you.

300
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:24,077
YOON CHUNG-A
SOLO EXHIBITION

301
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,120
On my way here,

302
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,000
I briefly thought
that I might run into you.

303
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,004
Me too.

304
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,050
I thought it'd feel
really awkward to see you.

305
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,344
But it's only a little bit awkward.

306
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,223
How have you been?

307
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,644
I've been good. What about you?

308
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,899
I've been good too.

309
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,028
I stayed in Washington for three years,
and now I'm working at HQ.

310
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,405
I took the day off today.

311
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,660
Everyone found out about my breakup

312
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,912
and is still gossiping.

313
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,956
They wondered

314
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,417
if I had gone to Washington
because I was heartbroken.

315
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,217
It bothered me at first, but not anymore.

316
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:12,227
To them, talking about the breakup
is the same as talking about the weather.

317
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,103
It doesn't mean anything.

318
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,112
What are you doing these days?

319
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,034
I own a small drawing cafÃ©.

320
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,911
It suits you.

321
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,669
Can Iâ€¦ visit sometime?

322
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,175
Back then,

323
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,137
I did resent you.

324
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,228
But as time passed by,
I became more curious

325
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,147
about why you did that.

326
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,408
Four years have passed,
and I still don't understand.

327
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,161
Neverthelessâ€¦

328
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,040
I missed you.

329
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,132
Me too.

330
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,637
You popped into my head
every now and then.

331
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,318
Stop by sometime.

332
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,863
I'll bring my boyfriend with me.

333
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,283
What?

334
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,746
Did you think
I'd be hung up on Sang-su forever?

335
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,792
I was able to move on.

336
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,671
I feel totally fine talking about him now.

337
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,090
Is it just me?

338
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,346
I'm sure it's the same for everyone.

339
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,349
It'd be unbearable
if the pain lasted forever.

340
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,524
Mr. Jeong, was it?

341
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,903
I wonder if he became a police officer.

342
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,738
Aren't you curious?

343
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,915
JEONG JONG-HYEON
POLICE

344
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:05,233
I heard you threatened my landlord
not to raise the deposit.

345
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,609
Of course, I did.

346
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:11,447
I can do that much for you.
It's not like I bought you this building.

347
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,701
And she doesn't need to make more money.

348
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,121
She also owns the 16-story building
near the intersection, you know.

349
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,416
Anyway, thanks.

350
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,336
Don't mention it.

351
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,213
My husband has never thanked me once,

352
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,092
no matter what delicacies
I cooked for him.

353
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,720
Right.

354
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,765
Mi-gyeong might get married next spring.

355
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,645
She's not your son's ex
but your friend's daughter,

356
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,022
so you'll attend, right?

357
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,609
I will. Congratulations.

358
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,320
Don't you regret it?

359
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,742
Don't you regret not having her
as your daughter-in-law?

360
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,623
I bet Sang-su really regrets it.
There's no one like her, you know.

361
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,419
Right. I'm sure he's bawling
somewhere as we speak.

362
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,297
Yes, he'd better be bawling.

363
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,054
Please sign the checked items.

364
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,099
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes?

365
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,020
The credit guarantee foundation wants to
assign the inspection. What should I do?

366
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,189
Give me the paper, I'll take a look.

367
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,273
-Thank you.
-No problem.

368
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,941
-I'll put it here.
-Okay.

369
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,818
Should I sign here too?

370
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,862
Yes, please put your name
and signature here.

371
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,988
Right.

374
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,166
Right, Ms. Ahn.

375
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,544
Ms. Song Gyeong-suk
wanted one of your designs.

376
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,004
Which one?

377
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,923
The one we took down this month.

378
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,008
The one with flowers and the ocean.

379
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,344
I'll look for it.

380
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,137
Thanks for today. You can go home.

381
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,514
Okay. See you tomorrow.

382
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,562
By the way, is there a meaning
to our cafÃ©'s name?

383
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,274
Why do you ask?

384
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,778
One of our customers asked,
so I was wondering what it could be.

385
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,990
It doesn't mean much.

386
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,953
-See you.
-Goodbye.

387
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,079
Bye.

CONTACT NUMBER: 010-947-4504

393
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,689
Why didn't you look for her?

394
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,904
Wasn't it possible to look for her
even if she didn't contact you?

395
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,200
I did go to her place once.

396
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,746
But she wasn't there.

397
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,585
I don't think
she would've liked me to keep looking.

398
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,755
Or maybe you lost confidence.

399
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,345
She may have decided to ghost you,

400
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,474
but maybe you gave up on her too.

401
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,769
I didn't.

402
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,486
Or did I?

00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,017
Ms. Park.

405
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,521
About the loan for Future Happiness
that you mentioned beforeâ€¦

406
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,449
-Hello?
-Is this Ms. Ahn Su-yeong?

407
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,701
This is Park Seong-eun
from the Yeomnam branch.

408
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,744
Are you available today, by any chance?

409
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,330
We'd like to visit you
regarding some missing documents.

410
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,083
Yes, I'm free today.

411
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,795
Assistant Manager Ha Sang-su
will take over your case from now on.

412
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,380
He'll be there shortly.

413
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,342
Hello?

414
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,803
Ms. Ahn?

415
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,347
Ohâ€¦

416
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,726
Okay.

417
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,996
You were here.

418
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,264
Is this a cafÃ©?

419
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,643
Yes.

420
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,898
And you can draw here as well.

421
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,957
We need a few more documents.

422
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,837
A statement of your rent payment

423
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,423
and a certificate of VAT tax base.

424
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,800
Okay.

425
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,807
I'll come back
for the inspection next time.

426
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,811
Okay.

427
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,663
Would youâ€¦

428
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,544
Would you like some coffee?

429
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,199
I have to submit photos of your cafÃ©.

430
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,452
I see.

431
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,816
Aren't you going to drink it?

432
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,110
What? Right.

433
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,411
Here's a wet wipe.

434
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,671
Why are you laughing?

435
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,758
It's just thatâ€¦

436
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,345
You haven't changed one bit.

437
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,903
How have you been?

438
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,493
What about you?

439
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,129
I tried to be happy.

440
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,351
What about you?

441
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,189
I heard you're an assistant manager now.

442
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,073
I also triedâ€¦

443
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,619
to be happy.

444
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,133
Why did you name

445
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,846
this cafÃ© Future Happiness?

446
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,687
Just because.

447
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,658
But I also wanted to find it.

448
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,831
My future's happiness.

449
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,141
I'll see you during the inspection.

450
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,395
Take care.

451
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,982
Okay.

452
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,946
It's okay. I'm fine.

453
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,531
Sit down.

454
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,702
This is why people
like experienced workers.

455
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,412
I gave birth very quickly.

456
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,622
Congratulations.

457
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,543
I heard this was
a popular caterpillar plushie.

458
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,212
Goodness, thank you.

459
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,297
And thank you for visiting.

460
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:34,262
By the way,
did you bring what I asked for?

461
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,145
Decaffeinated coffee.

462
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,957
That hit the spot.

463
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,293
I was dying to have some.

464
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,005
I couldn't have any
when I was pregnant or breastfeeding.

465
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,758
You made my biggest wish come true.

466
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,183
By the way, did you take out that loan
at the Yeomnam branch?

467
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,312
You knew, didn't you?

468
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,441
That Mr. Ha was there.

469
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,193
So you two met. How was it?

470
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,908
I didn't feel anything.

471
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,162
If that was the case,

472
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,914
then why have you been
in hiding all this time?

473
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,171
Su-yeong.

474
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,884
Don't you think
you can be easier on yourself now?

475
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,471
A lot of time has passed.

476
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,600
And you're doing what you want
and making a living out of it.

477
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,856
So you want me
to start a relationship with him?

478
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,817
I meanâ€¦

479
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,696
I'm not telling you to date someone
whom you're not interested in.

480
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,575
But people who are destined for each other
will get together eventually.

481
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,285
It doesn't necessarily have to be him.

482
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,666
I just want you to stop
bottling everything up inside.

483
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,263
It was cheese yesterday and tuna today.

484
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,974
I'm so sick of gimbap now.

485
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,479
Hey, can you make
those fried tofu rice balls again?

486
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,314
Okay.

487
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,067
Your girlfriend
is going to love you for your cooking.

488
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,780
Are you still wearing that watch?

489
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,991
You got a raise. Get a new one.

490
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,536
It's still working just fine.

491
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,247
But the face is cracked.

492
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,084
Buy one of these.

493
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,629
I don't want to throw it away.

494
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,674
Why? Is there a story behind that watch?

495
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,677
I'll head out first. Take your time.

496
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,185
You'll be the first person I salute
when I become an officer.

497
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,398
-Promise?
-Yes. I'll keep it at all costs.

498
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,294
Mi-gyeong!

499
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,152
INSERT COIN

500
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,085
-You're here early.
-Yes.

501
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,798
When did you start smoking?

502
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,845
Why? You smoke too.

503
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,556
I quit.

504
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,975
When?

505
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,354
It's been a while.

506
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,192
You'll live longer, then.

507
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,032
Let's go inside.

508
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,922
I could've just gone to the bank.

509
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,259
That's okay.

510
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:05,273
Then everything's set now, right?

511
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,237
Yes.

512
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,715
Thenâ€¦

513
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,189
Can I paint before I go?

514
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,318
I want to give it a try.

515
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,954
Add a bit more shading here.

516
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,587
Here.

517
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,338
Right.

518
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,549
Thank you.

519
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,594
You did a good job.

520
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,680
All I did was color.

521
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,225
You're very detailed.

522
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,357
What's this?

523
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,695
A sand castle.

524
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,537
It just looks like a mound of dirt.

525
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,433
It'll be difficult to carry.

526
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,021
It's okay. I brought my car.

527
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,112
Wellâ€¦

528
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,201
Take care, then.

529
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,663
Okay.

530
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,295
It was nice to see you again.

531
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,592
Same here.

532
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,106
I hope you have a happy life.

533
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,985
You too.

534
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,878
I'm really going to leave now.

535
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,801
Okay.

536
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,901
I hope you have a happy life.

537
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,449
You too.

538
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,758
I can't believe we ran into each other.

539
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:51,762
Me neither.

540
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,061
You must be going through a rough patch.

541
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,862
You said you only came here
when things got tough.

542
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,490
Because this place

543
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,493
-lets me know thatâ€¦
-â€¦that everything will eventually pass.

544
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,464
You remembered.

545
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,721
Not many people come
to such places at times like that.

546
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,270
Su-yeong, why did you come here?

547
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,278
I've been coming every so often.

548
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,538
It's good exercise to walk around here.

549
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,540
It's also quiet and empty.

550
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,180
By the way,

551
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,017
why don't you ask me?

552
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,525
About why I ghosted you.

553
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,164
Since I couldn't see you in personâ€¦

554
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,336
I just asked that question
and answered it myself.

555
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,719
I still don't completely understand,

556
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:56,887
but I thinkâ€¦

557
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,098
I somewhat understand.

558
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:13,487
And it didn't feel right
to miss someone who broke a promise.

559
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,574
What promise?

560
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,294
The pork cutlets?

561
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,601
How aboutâ€¦

562
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,228
you keep that promise tomorrow?

563
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,785
Sure.

564
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,995
Let's do it.

565
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,682
KCU BANK
YEOMNAM BRANCH

566
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,832
We came through the front gate again,
but the restaurant is near the back.

567
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,544
Yeahâ€¦

568
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,131
The parking lot is near the front gate.

569
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,177
It makes me wonder
if you really graduated from here.

570
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,269
This place hasn't changed
in the past four years.

571
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:38,651
It looked the same
when I was a student here.

572
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,196
It feels like time stops
when you're at school.

573
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,323
It's always the same.

574
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:56,085
By the way, it feels really weird
to be here together.

575
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,215
Same here.

576
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:08,347
We're finally having the pork cutlets
that you bragged so much about.

577
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,730
Why didn't you call me back?

578
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,238
Well, why didn't you come looking for me?

579
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,241
You said you could always find me.

580
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,620
I did look for you.

581
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:37,042
I went back to Tongyeong
a week after we parted ways.

582
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:42,339
But Tongyeong was bigger
than I had thought.

583
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:53,559
Now can you tell me why you did that?

584
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,609
Becauseâ€¦

585
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,238
there was no more to give.

586
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,835
And no more to receive.

587
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,811
Have you ever imaginedâ€¦

588
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,151
how things would've been
had you made a different decision?

589
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:58,082
Whoever was deeper in love
doesn't have lingering thoughts like that.

590
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,169
Only the one who ran away has regrets.

591
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,218
You have no problem
talking about such things now.

592
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,639
A lot of time has passed.

593
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,600
It's only natural.

594
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,607
I remember you bawling
because you liked me so much.

595
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,110
What? I never did that.

596
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,030
I never went that far.

597
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,499
After you left, there was a timeâ€¦

598
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,670
when I wondered about it every day.

599
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,725
"What ifâ€¦

600
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:01,645
I hadn't hesitated that night?"

601
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,023
-Did you make a--
-Excuse me.

602
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,801
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

603
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,517
No, it's fine.

604
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,035
"What if I hadn't turned around?"

605
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,735
"What if I had been open and honest?"

606
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,855
"What if I had told you
not to run away again?"

607
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,176
"What if I had asked you to come with me?"

608
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,235
What about you?

609
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,242
I do wonder sometimes.

610
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,817
I'm sorry for being late, Su-yeong.

611
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,822
It's okay. You're here now.

612
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,045
"What if I had waited a bit longer?"

613
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,258
If I had kept my promiseâ€¦

614
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,470
that day at the hotelâ€¦

615
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,519
would you have dated me?

616
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,566
Actually, Iâ€¦

617
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,948
Jong-hyeon and I aren't in a relationship.

618
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,826
"What if I had been honest?"

619
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,621
You asked me

620
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,331
at the training institute

621
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,669
if things would've been different for us

622
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,755
had you shown up that day.

623
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,637
I regretâ€¦

624
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,764
not telling the truth.

625
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:49,349
Yes.

626
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,894
Things would've been different.

627
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:55,981
I like you.

628
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,778
I know I'll sound like a jerk
for saying this right now,

629
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,780
but I'll take that risk.

630
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,576
Ahn Su-yeong,

631
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:10,328
I like you.

632
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,836
To be honestâ€¦

633
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,176
I also

634
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,095
like you.

635
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,684
"What if I had said that I liked you too?"

636
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,234
I don't have to see you off, right?

637
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:36,540
Let's go together.

638
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:52,055
"And that I wanted to go with you?"

639
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,316
It's all in the past.

640
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:07,070
That's why I think of so many what-ifs.

641
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,870
In that case,
how do you think things would've changed?

642
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,420
We might have gotten married.

643
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:28,717
And had a baby.

644
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:33,930
And fight at times?

645
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:38,560
Right. We would've been working parents,

646
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,564
so we would've argued about stuff like,

647
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,858
who would drop off the kid at daycare.

648
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,112
And that could've
eventually led to a divorce.

649
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,366
You always imagine the worst.

650
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,705
There's also a possibility
that we could've made up

651
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,498
and lived happily ever after.

652
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,587
I guess so.

653
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,927
But even in our imaginationsâ€¦

654
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,472
there's nothing very special.

655
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,145
Isn't that what love is?

656
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,067
Two people going through
everyday life together.

657
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,927
We were once

658
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,888
a part of each other's lives.

659
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,898
We fell for each other.

660
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,246
Our hearts skipped for each other.

661
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:33,508
We were foolish.

662
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,478
All the momentsâ€¦

663
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,572
that we regretted made usâ€¦

664
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,081
long for each other even more.

665
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,760
During those timesâ€¦

666
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,306
-Were weâ€¦
-Were weâ€¦

667
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,185
actually in loveâ€¦

668
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,772
Or were we blinded by the interest?

669
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,160
What did you forget today?

670
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,216
You said this was the Hill of Oblivion.

671
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,265
So I wondered what you forgot today.

672
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:13,942
Nothing.

673
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,996
Absolutely nothing.

674
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:33,605
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

675
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:35,541
