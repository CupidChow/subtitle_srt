THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,846
All right. Let's have a productive day.

3
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,100
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, everyone.

4
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,477
DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWAL

5
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,938
-Welcome to KCU Bank.
-Welcome to KCU Bank.

6
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,401
At exactly 9:00 a.m., the bank opens.

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,653
I can help the first customer here.

8
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,116
This is Chief Ha Sang-su
of the Youngpo branch.

9
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,743
KCU celebrates
its 62nd anniversary this year.

10
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,539
To our left are the financial district
and white-collar workers.

11
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,960
To our right
is a marketplace with 50 years of history.

12
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,758
Over 300 customers visit
the Youngpo branch every single day.

13
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,718
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

14
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,845
Welcome to KCU, ma'am.

15
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,804
Hello.

16
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,892
However, we do not show
the same love for every single client.

17
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:09,230
Those who come to borrow money
must take a number and wait.

18
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,273
Hello.

19
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,277
Those who come to lend money
to the bank are escorted.

20
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,696
VIP clients who deposit…

21
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,489
-Goodness.
-…over a certain amount…

22
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,242
-You're here.
-…go straight to the branch manager.

23
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,952
And VVIP clients…

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,204
-This isn't much.
-…don't even come in…

25
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,164
Thank you.

26
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,917
…because a bank clerk goes to their home.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,876
-I see.
-Yes.

28
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,211
I'm afraid you can't get
a large credit limit.

29
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,422
How much longer do I have to wait?

30
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,884
I'm sorry, sir.
Please wait a moment. I'm very sorry.

31
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,470
Who's that, then? Is this discrimination?

32
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,430
-I'm sorry, sir.
-One second.

33
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,390
-Let me check the limit.
-That's right.

34
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,100
We do discriminate

35
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,563
based on your account balance
and monthly expenditures.

36
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,067
During the Joseon era,
social class determined your status.

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,570
But in 2022, your status in Korea
is determined by your wealth.

38
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,990
Such social status ranking exists

39
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,535
for both those visiting the bank
and those working at the bank.

40
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,996
It also exists…

41
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,505
between me and her.

42
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,884
Here.

EPISODE 1

45
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,829
Go!

46
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,842
Last month, your team won
the office league ice hockey tournament.

47
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,677
Please tell us how you feel.

48
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,636
Well.

49
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,348
This is all thanks to KCU Bank's support
of intramural activities

50
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,976
to aid with employee self-development
and leisure pursuits.

51
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,103
-Thank you.
-Sure.

52
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,606
Hello, Mr. Ma.

53
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,693
I'll transfer that client
to the credit guarantee foundation.

54
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:23,406
The guarantee fund has a higher limit,
but the screening takes much longer.

55
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,868
Yes, sir. I'll go back and wrap it up.

56
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,828
Yes, all right.

57
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,706
ASSISTANT MANAGER
MA DU-SIK

58
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,751
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

59
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,128
It just ended. He'll come and wrap it up.

60
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,174
Sang-su can't afford to go out
and act cool right now.

61
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,968
He should be at work
trying to improve his performance.

62
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,305
The in-house broadcasting team as well.
Why shoot on a weekday?

63
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,599
Where are their manners? Good grief.

64
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,019
Because both you and those people
want to rest on the weekend.

65
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,028
Mr. Ha's interview is up
on the bank's social media.

66
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,654
Let me see.

67
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,533
My gosh. What is that?

68
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,870
He seems different in this light.

69
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,123
Right? He looks like
a real athlete in this uniform.

70
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,000
If you like him, ask him out.

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
Even if I did, he'd probably say no.

72
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,797
Men are more particular these days.

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm just a service rep
who went to college outside of Seoul.

74
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,053
So what? We're all bank clerks.

75
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,348
Actually, we're not all the same.

76
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,393
Service reps are people
with unlimited contracts.

77
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,063
But people with regular positions
are formally recruited.

78
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,608
So you need to transfer positions
while you're still young.

79
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,694
If you don't, you'll end up like Su-yeong.

80
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,279
Goodness.

81
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,992
You always manage to say things
that rub people the wrong way.

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaking of Su-yeong, where is she?

83
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,877
She always eats lunch alone.
Who knows where she goes off to?

84
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,827
Hey, Auntie.
You got your hair permed. You look great!

85
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,620
-Can I get married now?
-Of course!

86
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,705
-Goodness.
-You're pretty!

87
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,540
Hey, you're here already?

88
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,624
-Hey.
-My gosh.

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,293
You just had knee surgery!

90
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,711
-Goodness.
-I'm fine.

91
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,712
No.

92
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,630
Take it easy, and don't get hurt again.

93
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,257
I'm fine.

94
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,384
Auntie, you don't look well.

95
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,635
Are you ill?

96
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,305
Your investment savings matured.
Come by sometime.

97
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,682
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

98
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,309
Hey, Mr. So-Nosy. You're good at this.

99
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,937
Hello, Auntie!

100
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,440
Auntie! Two gukbaps, please.

101
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,691
Okay, sure.

102
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,067
-Hi, Auntie.
-Come on in.

103
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,284
You look great on camera.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
I can picture your value skyrocketing.

105
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,039
What good is all that?

106
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,042
It's good for dating, that's what.
Don't play innocent.

107
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,629
Wait, do you like someone in particular?

108
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,796
Like Ahn Su-yeong?

109
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,299
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,468
I saw you two in the morning

111
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,804
-blinking like this.
-When did I do that?

112
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,640
I thought you had an eye infection.

113
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,476
Here we go.

114
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,895
Help yourself to more side dishes later.

115
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,104
Okay.

116
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,774
-Auntie, it's time you came by the bank.
-Okay, sure.

117
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,234
-Stop by, okay?
-Got it.

118
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,277
-I love you!
-Goodness.

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,365
Gosh, you're so considerate.

120
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,783
I might fall for you.

121
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,326
And I'll turn you down.

122
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,207
She was your immediate supervisor
when you were a rookie, right?

123
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,669
Was she? So what?

124
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,754
That was already three years ago.

125
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,174
You had plenty of time
to have started something with her.

126
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,801
Be quiet and wipe your hands.

127
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,762
Well, I suppose

128
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,557
that it's wiser just to work
and move up to the head office.

129
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,602
I hear human resources
always spot office romances first, anyway.

130
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
I told you not to call.

131
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,042
Please just leave me alone.

132
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,940
Do you want this?

133
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,501
Hey, what about this?

134
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,629
Come on. That's your style.

135
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,880
Are they?

136
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,470
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

137
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,393
My son said he'd wire the money today.

138
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,481
I have to pay rent,
and I'm out of ramyeon too.

139
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,109
Ma'am, then why don't you
call your son again?

140
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,861
His phone is turned off.

141
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,820
I see.

142
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,409
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, Sang-su.

143
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,495
How can I help you?

144
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,455
Can you give my card a try?

145
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,209
Right. Give me a second, and I'll try it.

146
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,960
-Please do.
-Okay.

147
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,256
Please insert your card.

148
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,843
ENTER YOUR PIN

149
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,890
Please press the desired button.

150
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,891
BALANCE: 5,320 WON

151
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:49,500
Please make sure to take
all your belongings. Thank you.

152
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,420
Ma'am, I think this
is all you've received so far.

153
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,672
Please get some ramyeon
and water with this,

154
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,841
and then talk to your son again, okay?

155
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,467
-I will.
-Okay.

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,635
Thank you. Goodbye.

157
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,138
-Goodbye.
-Thank you again.

158
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,768
Have you had lunch yet?

159
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,478
I'm about to head out.

160
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,899
Here. Take this.
It's surplus money from this month.

161
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,443
You don't have to do this.

162
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
Go eat something good.

163
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm sorry, but no.

164
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,659
-Everyone is waiting.
-But I'm busy.

165
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,120
No, please take a number first.

166
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,080
We're not supposed to do this,

167
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,083
but we'll make it happen.

168
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,293
I'll process it now.

169
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,962
You said you were moving.
Did you find a nice place?

170
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,380
I brought the paperwork.

171
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,466
You're here for a refund and not a loan?

172
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,427
Mr. Ha here will help you with the refund.

173
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,470
-Mr. Ha.
-But…

174
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,430
Thanks a lot.

175
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,225
Yes, how may I help you?

176
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,935
-A refund.
-A refund?

177
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,563
Can I see your ID, please?

178
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,607
Do you have any more questions?

179
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,900
No, thank you. I'm fine.

180
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,776
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

181
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,787
Mr. Lee, I need these approved.

182
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,499
How much longer do I have to wait?

183
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,751
Please wait, and you'll be called in time.

184
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,877
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,754
Jeez, I already read an entire magazine.

186
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,674
-You're all set. Thank you.
-Thank you.

187
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,676
Should I take a few?

188
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,471
Yes, thank you.

189
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,350
Next, please.

190
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,062
How may I help you?

191
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,525
Number 418, I can help you at window two.

192
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,818
Hello.

193
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,530
Hello. How may I help you?

194
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,948
I came for my credit card.

195
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,950
Can I see your ID, please?

196
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,079
Your shirt looks great, sir.

197
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,665
I'm heading to the airport
for Jeju Island.

198
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,250
It's an alumni trip.

199
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,294
-Gosh, you're so lucky.
-Yes.

200
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,172
-Mr. Kim Seong-hun.
-Yes.

201
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,801
One second, please.

202
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,597
What kind of nonsense is this?

203
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,145
The highest amount of interest
I can get is 300,000 won,

204
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,315
but I can lose up to
3.5 million won in the end.

205
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,027
That's true, but as I told you,
the US index rarely falls--

206
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,529
Will you take responsibility, then?

207
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,866
It's written right here.
"There is a risk of principal loss."

208
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,577
Would you take up something
to make a mere 300,000 won

209
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,037
at the risk of losing 3.5 million won?

210
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,706
KIM SEONG-HUN

211
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,750
…because you wanted higher interest
than regular savings.

212
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,710
-I--
-Wait!

213
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,670
So you're saying…

214
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,047
-Your card, sir.
-I didn't know any better…

215
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,842
-Enjoy your trip.
-so you wanted to deceive me?

216
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,262
I'm sorry for the confusion.

217
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,140
Do you think I'm some kind of an idiot?

218
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
I can't believe this!

219
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,314
I'm sorry. Let me show you
another product--

220
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,732
Forget it!

221
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,402
Take this yourself
and do whatever you want!

222
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,157
Who are you?

223
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,843
Here.

224
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,094
Thank you.

225
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,351
You need to perform well
to transfer positions, right?

226
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,396
I'm totally on your side.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,983
But you need to know your clients
before you offer them products.

228
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,029
No matter how well you perform,
if you keep getting complaints,

229
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,073
you'll end up losing in the end.

230
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,283
You're right.

231
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,621
Gosh.

232
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,459
I think it's ridiculous to differentiate
between service reps and regular clerks.

233
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:05,089
One Ahn Su-yeong is way better
than a truck full of university graduates.

234
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,137
Su-yeong, where's the credit card
for Mr. Kim Seong-hun?

235
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,098
He came to collect it,

236
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,142
but this card is
for Mr. Kim Seong-hun, the VIP.

237
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,488
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes, sir.

238
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,782
Mr. Ha Sang-su.

239
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,868
Is there trouble at home?

240
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,080
Or do you have something against me?

241
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:43,460
How can a bank clerk give out a card
without checking the numbers first?

242
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,673
And why did you make
this ridiculous mistake…

243
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,136
How can you give
someone else's card to a VIP client?

244
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,765
Have you gone…
Look at this guy. Have you lost your mind?

245
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,060
I was busy, so I asked him
to do it for me.

247
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,314
What kind of nonsense is this?

248
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,901
The highest amount of interest
I can get is 300,000 won,

249
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,654
but I can lose up to
3.5 million won in the end.

250
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,698
KIM SEONG-HUN
DANGSONG DISTRICT

251
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,742
KIM SEONG-HUN
JANGCHUNG DISTRICT

252
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,577
What?

253
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,164
Is that so, Ms. Ahn?
You asked him to do that?

254
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,833
All right, then.

255
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,919
Since Kim Seong-hun
is a one-of-a-kind name,

256
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,298
and there couldn't possibly be
two clients with the same name,

257
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,176
you asked him to do a quick, sloppy job?

258
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,136
-I'm sorry.
-On top of that,

259
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,681
you told him to give
a lower-tier card to the VIP,

260
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:43,228
and a VIP card to a lower-tier customer
in a noble effort to redistribute wealth?

261
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,398
I see.
What a great thought. Very nicely done.

262
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,698
Why are you just standing there?
Go to Jeju Island now!

263
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,742
Hey, Ms. Ahn. You go with him.

264
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,203
You've known this client
for some time, right?

265
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,456
What if he gets offended
and changes his primary bank?

266
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,417
If he says that,
then I'm seriously going to…

267
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,133
-Over there.
-Okay. Are we late?

268
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
We'll see when we get there.

269
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,143
Thank you.

270
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,902
-We're here.
-I see.

271
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,028
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,637
That's better, right?

273
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,224
Yes.

274
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,148
I can't believe we're on a plane
to Jeju Island right now.

275
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
I feel the same way.

276
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,155
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

277
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,781
Not at all.

278
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,117
I was the one who made a mistake.

279
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,619
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,250
Okay, then.

281
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,961
Let's agree this is your fault, Mr. Ha.

282
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,758
Why are you smiling?

283
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,472
This reminds me of the old days
when you first came to our branch.

284
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,894
I see.

285
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,689
Two rookies have arrived at our branch.

286
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,318
They're first and last place
in their trainee class.

287
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,361
Ha Sang-su and So Gyeong-pil.

288
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,155
Give them a hand.

289
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,911
Just to let you know,
I came in last place.

290
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,081
But you're first place
when it comes to humor.

291
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,877
Also, Ms. Seo Min-hui
will return next month

292
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,712
from maternity leave.

293
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,465
So, for now, the Goddess
of our Youngpo branch,

294
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,468
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong,
can train him in deposit duties.

295
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,719
Yes, sir.

296
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,679
When I first came here as a rookie,

297
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,474
Su-yeong was
the Goddess of Youngpo branch.

298
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,439
A withdrawal mistake?
A withdrawal mistake on your first day?

299
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,235
-Senior Clerk Ha Sang-su.
-Yes?

300
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,153
Weren't you the top of the trainees?

301
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,864
I thought that
we finally got a solid rookie,

302
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,283
but how did we end up with this idiot?

303
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,162
Hey, how can a bank clerk
withdraw money twice?

304
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,041
Is that your own money?
Is it? Say something!

305
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,127
Mr. So, get over here.

307
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,380
-My first day…
-How in the world was he trained?

308
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,049
I made a mistake
withdrawing money before the goddess.

309
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,175
What are you going to do?

310
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,426
I'll train him, sir.

311
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,053
-Get over here!
-This was the moment…

312
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,764
-All of you!
-I went from top trainee to idiot.

313
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,892
You two trained together.
What should I do with him?

314
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,104
-You learned this in training, right?
-Yes.

315
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,650
Secure this right here
between your left middle and ring fingers.

316
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,696
Fold it. Good.

317
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,409
Move your right thumb up and down.
Then count the cash with your ring finger.

318
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,002
Wait, move this finger.
Like this. One by one.

319
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,753
I see.

320
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,842
I can't move my ring finger well.

321
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,804
Even if you use a money counter,
you have to double-check it.

322
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,474
Lastly, put the clean bills
in the front and back.

323
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,770
-Then hold it with your index finger.
-I see. Like this?

324
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,232
And secure it like this.

325
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,198
Then stamp the stack
to show who counted the bills.

326
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,331
-Give it a try.
-Okay.

327
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
-Wrap it tightly.
-Line it up…

328
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

329
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,981
Goodness, you came all this way for this?

330
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,066
It's all right, sir.

331
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,152
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

332
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:46,364
Yes, we gave him the right card.
Thankfully, Mr. Kim was understanding…

333
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,454
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

334
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,084
Yes, I'll return right away.

335
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,169
Yes, sir.

336
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,914
Do you have someone to send them to?

337
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,212
I mean, you seemed
invested in taking pictures.

338
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,506
So…

339
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
Are they for your boyfriend?

340
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,305
I don't have a boyfriend.

341
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,726
I took pictures because it's pretty here.

342
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,276
I see.

343
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,631
It must have fallen from up there.

344
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,719
Just leave it alone.

345
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,350
If humans touch the eggs,
mother birds push them out of the nest.

346
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,186
Can it survive like this?

347
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,022
It'll end up broken anyway.

348
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,234
But there's a chance it won't.

349
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,779
It might be fine
if I cover it with this and put it back.

350
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,533
Let's help it first
and let the mother bird decide later.

351
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,121
It doesn't matter if it breaks.
I'd feel bad if we didn't try.

352
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,843
I think…

353
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,014
it might be faster if I climb up.

354
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,566
Should I get on my knees, then?

355
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,193
Sorry?

356
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,070
I'll get down, and you can step up.

357
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,450
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's fine.

358
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,047
Thank you.

359
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,513
-The egg, please.
-Okay.

360
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
-Did you get up?
-Can you hand me the egg?

361
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,406
Sure.

362
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,116
Here.

363
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,672
Be safe.

364
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,174
Are you done?

365
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,843
Yes.

366
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,897
What should I…

367
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,254
Thank you.

368
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,892
See? I was right.

369
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,144
Yes.

370
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,979
I was wrong.

371
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,857
I'm glad we helped.

372
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,741
Ms. Ahn?
We have some time left until our flight.

373
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,787
Do you want to go somewhere nearby?

374
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,125
We should probably wait at the airport.

375
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,506
Right. Okay.

376
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,262
Can you take a photo for me?
I'd like to remember today.

377
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,305
Sure.

378
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,064
One, two, three.

379
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,069
One more time. One, two, three.

380
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,035
Thank you.

381
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,891
The balance is correct.

382
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,186
Let's call it a day.

383
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,605
-Good job.
-Great job today.

384
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,191
-Good work.
-Goodbye.

385
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,401
See you tomorrow.

386
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,236
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

387
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,320
Goodbye.

388
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,824
Let's grab a drink.

389
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,035
A drink, my foot.

390
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,164
Seok-hyeon is about to break up
with his girlfriend.

391
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,668
Okay, let's go.

392
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:18,757
Are you headed out to get wasted?
A consolation party for Sang-su's mistake?

393
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,092
Yesterday, it was Seok-hyeon.
Today, it was Sang-su.

394
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,887
Is it Gyeong-pil's turn tomorrow?

395
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,805
Stop messing around together.

396
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,768
You three keep hanging out together
and make people call you that thing.

397
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,770
What was it? I can't remember.

398
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,188
Mr. Ma, what was it again?

399
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,689
The Three Idiots of Youngpo.

400
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,025
Right. The Three Idiots of Youngpo.

401
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,818
-Sang-su.
-Yes?

402
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,738
You're different.
You need to maintain your image.

403
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,532
Let's go. I'll make you feel better.

404
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,537
Do you have time in your busy day
to boost the morale of your associate?

405
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,623
Why do you think I like being single?

406
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,667
I have no wife or children to look after,
so I'm free after work!

407
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,920
You have my respect, sir. Let's go.

408
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,257
-You were great today.
-You too.

409
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,759
Ms. Ahn, you should join us.

410
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,469
Mr. Lee is going too.

411
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,805
I have another engagement.
See you tomorrow.

412
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,265
You have a lot of those.

413
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,727
Ms. Seo, go home right away.

414
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,738
She definitely has a boyfriend.

415
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,201
She's obviously the type
that guys would line up for.

416
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,632
She might have more than one.

417
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,426
Some say she sees
a different guy every day.

418
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,681
Have you seen her
with a different guy every day, Mr. Ma?

419
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,808
Come on.

420
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,144
Why else would she refuse to come out?
It's all because of men.

421
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,481
She's the type who lives up to her looks--

422
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,566
-Hey.
-My gosh.

423
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,859
What are you doing?

424
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,653
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

425
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,072
Why did you pour beer on my pants?

426
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,242
I just got these dry-cleaned.

427
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,201
Darn it.

428
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,829
Where's Seok-hyeon?

429
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,039
On the phone with his girlfriend.

430
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,085
Jeez, why do you all
go through the trouble of dating?

431
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,503
What's he doing?

432
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,609
CONTACTS

433
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,527
AHN SU-YEONG

434
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,036
It's the photo I took for her
on Jeju Island.

435
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,587
What is this? What does this mean?

436
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,884
Did she want me to see this?

437
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,683
Where are you right now?

438
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,615
What are you up to?

439
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,743
What are you doing, Sang-su?

440
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,208
Did you get home okay?

441
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,298
Thank you for going
to Jeju Island with me.

442
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,877
Maybe I shouldn't have sent that.

443
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,985
I had fun and got
some fresh air, thanks to you.

444
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,245
MOM

445
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,996
MISSED CALLS: MOM

446
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,551
Watch where you're going.

447
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,469
Why are you so self-centered?

448
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,804
Whatever.

449
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,682
Who wants to go out on the street?

450
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,392
Move. Excuse me.

451
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,393
Jeez.

452
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,437
Ji-yun, you said you had
something important to tell me.

453
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,398
I did?

454
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,985
That's right. I do.

455
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,530
I'll go.

456
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,698
Will you?

457
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,535
I wonder which one of you
should take the street shift today.

458
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,538
-It's Mr. Ma's turn.
-I'll go.

459
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,206
Really?

460
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,460
I had a bit too much to eat,
so it'll be good for my digestion.

461
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,130
I see. That's good of you.

462
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,341
Don't let me stop you.

463
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,096
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

464
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,807
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

465
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,018
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

466
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,229
Let me take some of these for you.

467
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,106
No, it's okay.

468
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,108
It's not a lot, anyway.

469
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,861
You should go sit and take a break.

470
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,487
I'll be done in no time.

471
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
Right. Take this.

472
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,242
Have some and wait just a moment.

473
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,332
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

474
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,251
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

475
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,129
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

476
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,216
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

477
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,937
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

478
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,983
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

479
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,319
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

480
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,504
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

481
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,934
Ms. Ahn?

482
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,437
What do you usually do on weekends?

483
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,274
What about you, Mr. Ha?

484
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,655
This weekend,
I'd like to meet with you, Ms. Ahn.

485
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,285
Why?

486
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,206
There's no special reason
behind my asking.

487
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,627
We've worked together for a while
but haven't shared a meal,

488
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,381
and I felt grateful
that you came to Jeju Island with me.

489
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,175
Okay, then.

490
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,429
What?

491
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,931
I mean, I'd like that.

492
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,909
MOVIE THEATER

493
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,398
Mom, I told you to ring the doorbell.
I'm changing the passcode.

494
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,027
You don't ring the bell at my place.
You punch in the passcode too.

495
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,200
The place I ordered from last time
was a bit too salty.

496
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,285
It's better to eat bland food.

497
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,664
Then go ahead and find
a store that sells bland side dishes.

498
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,834
We're both single, so it's nice to share.
What's the big deal?

499
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,170
-I sent you half the money. Are we good?
-Yes.

500
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,632
And let this ripen for a day
before putting it in the fridge.

501
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,926
-Okay?
-What happened to your hand?

502
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,803
A group came in.

503
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,598
What kind of director
massages clients herself?

504
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,852
They've been coming to me from the start,
and I need the money to expand.

505
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,062
I need to work hard.

506
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,648
I told you not to overdo it
with the expansion.

507
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,816
Who's the woman?

508
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,568
What do you mean?

509
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,904
I gave you that facial pack
over a year ago,

510
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,656
but you refused to use it until now.

511
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,865
-Are you dating?
-Gosh.

512
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,910
No, it's not that.
I used it because it was about to expire.

513
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,328
-Whatever.
-Jeez.

514
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
Mom, why do you keep doing this?

515
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,458
Go on now. Leave.

516
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,668
-Go.
-What does she do?

517
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,003
-Let's go.
-Parents? Which university did she go to?

518
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,423
That kind of information
is important, you know.

519
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:29,260
Let's go, Mom.
It's not like that. What's with you?

520
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,210
Where are you?

521
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,421
I'm already here.

522
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,396
I'm sorry. I don't think I can go today.

523
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,546
I'm just kidding. Just count to ten.

524
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,306
Am I late?

525
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,732
Shall we?

526
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,761
Mr. Ha, you seem different
from when I see you at the bank.

527
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,184
Just a little.

528
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,856
You seem different, too, Su-yeong.

529
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,360
May I call you Su-yeong?

530
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,988
Sure.

531
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,117
Where's your hometown?

532
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,287
-Tongyeong.
-Tongyeong? I see.

533
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,874
I really love Tongyeong oysters.

534
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,752
I like them raw,
and I like oyster gukbap too.

535
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,253
And oyster jeon.

536
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,466
Oyster jeon and makgeolli together
just taste amazing.

537
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,260
I actually hate oysters.

538
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,098
You hate oysters. I see.

539
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,937
What's your family like?

540
00:44:55,025 --> 00:45:00,864
It's just me and Mom in my case.
My father passed away when I was young.

541
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,246
My parents are back in Tongyeong.

542
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,205
And…

543
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,708
I have a younger brother.

544
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,255
So you're an older sister.

545
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,299
How old is your brother?

546
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,054
Twenty-seven.

547
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,139
I see.

548
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,890
That's a fun age.

549
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,772
Why did you jump into
the workforce right away?

550
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,483
It seems like you would've
done well in college.

551
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,990
I enjoyed drawing more.

552
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,965
Guess who?

553
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,717
What?

554
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,843
Hey!

555
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,637
Why are you so late?

556
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,351
It was all too pretty for me to study.

557
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,480
Everything.

558
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,816
What about art school?

559
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,027
My family couldn't afford art school.

560
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,905
I'm sorry.

561
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,866
There's no need to apologize.

562
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,954
Who cares about college anyway?

563
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,626
You may not have gone to college,
but you're the best clerk at our bank.

564
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,296
I mean, look at me.
I made that huge mistake last time.

565
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,508
College isn't important at all.

566
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,855
This is it for me.

567
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,572
Your place has a great view.

568
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,080
I had fun today. Get home safely.

569
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,124
Okay.

570
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,091
Hey.

571
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,346
Can we…

572
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,059
Can we do this again?

573
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,981
And what if we do?

574
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,779
I just thought it'd be nice
to see you again.

575
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,036
I don't like undefined relationships.

576
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,925
I feel the same way.

577
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,011
Clear and defined.

578
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,391
Then let's meet again next week.

579
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,770
Mondays are hectic, so how about Tuesday?

580
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,773
That's my day off.

581
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,275
Then let's have dinner.

582
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,944
I'll treat you to something good.

583
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,156
Something that's clearly good.

584
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,244
Okay.

585
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:32,219
YOUNGPO CENTRAL TRADITIONAL MARKET

586
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,151
Kim Min-seok at Dangsang branch is
getting married. Did you see his invite?

587
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,404
Why do people insist on getting married?

588
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,241
This invite just looks like
a utility bill to me now.

589
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,994
Was that your attitude
when you came to my wedding?

590
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,373
I didn't go.
I sent you money the way I pay my bills.

591
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,582
You and your mouth.

592
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,919
But they're an office couple,
so they'll see each other often.

593
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,170
What? Are you jealous?

594
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,631
It'll be awful if they get divorced.

595
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,802
I've seen a lot of people lose everything
after dating someone at work.

596
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,889
Living a glamorous, single life like me
is the trend these days.

597
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,849
Jeez.

598
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,684
I agree. Just working is the best.

599
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,852
Who can we date, then?

600
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,187
We get off work too late to date.

601
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,149
Do you all want
to date at work that badly?

602
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,901
Ms. Ahn, are you interested
in an office romance too?

603
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,906
It depends on the person.

604
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,005
Let's see here.

605
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,592
Did you all receive the director's email

606
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,012
about the vice president's
Ready-Go Card event?

607
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,222
Twelve from the Deposits Team.

608
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,391
Five from the General Consultation Team.

609
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,603
And the General Affairs Team
can manage three, right?

610
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,940
We get department store vouchers
if we reach our goal.

611
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,859
Let's beat the Dangsang branch again!

612
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,402
We can do this!

613
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,279
-We can do this!
-We can do this!

614
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,039
What's going on with you?

615
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,001
You've been in
a suspiciously good mood lately.

616
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,007
Stop being so nosy.
Do you really have to know everything?

617
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,050
Goodness gracious.

618
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,844
Are you drawing a line between us?
That makes me sad.

619
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,346
My gosh.

620
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,017
Hey, you're not the sad one. He is.

621
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,689
He broke up with his girlfriend.

622
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,984
Have you lost your mind?
You're on the clock.

623
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,945
Do you want Mr. Noh to go off on you?

624
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,489
It's non-alcoholic.

625
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,700
Gosh.

626
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,412
Why did you two break up?
Didn't you want to marry her?

627
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,751
Have you ever seen a squat toilet?

628
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,007
I did. The toilet in her home
was that ancient.

629
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:24,599
My heart raced, and I fell for her.
I asked her out, and we dated.

630
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,395
Then I found out
that her family was far below mine.

631
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,023
But I didn't care
because my family is rich.

632
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,527
But after a while,
I started feeling self-conscious.

633
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,364
Whenever we went on dates or trips
and even when we talked about marriage,

634
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,451
her situation always came to mind first.

635
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,247
Do you know what's worse?

636
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,416
I began thinking

637
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,210
that the food she eats comes
from my parents' money and mine.

638
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,422
When I went to meet her family,

639
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,217
I ate boiled chicken
at her home and thought to myself,

640
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,637
"From now on, the money I make
will no longer be mine."

641
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,181
"I'm going to lose money by the second."

642
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,059
You should've thought it through
before dating her, then.

643
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,020
You said you loved her.

644
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,980
-If you didn't think you could--
-Hey.

645
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,482
Hey! Who knew it would be like this?

646
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,818
That my love was shallow?

647
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,113
Am I the only piece of trash around here?

648
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,907
No. Of course not.

649
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,450
Come on.

650
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,660
Why add insult to injury to Seok-hyeon?

651
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,829
Why did we meet? Why did I fall in love?

652
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,458
Only Romeo and Juliet
can love in a world like this.

653
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,253
But their families were
equally well-off, right?

654
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,568
Here is your ID.

655
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,611
Thank you.

656
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,822
You must like accessories too.

657
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,907
Yes.

658
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,868
My gosh. I love that ring.

659
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,119
Where did you get it?

660
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,830
I got it with my credit card points.

661
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,500
Credit card points? What do you mean?

662
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,835
I like to shop, so…

663
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,005
Would you like to check out
this card, then?

664
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,757
It just came out.

665
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,887
If you like to shop or go to cafés,
there are lots of perks and discounts.

666
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,931
This sounds nice.

667
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,933
Let me know if you're interested.

668
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,602
I think Su-yeong is going
to win the vouchers again.

669
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,479
You have to be tough like her

670
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,691
to become a permanent clerk
after starting as a part-timer.

671
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,775
So what?

672
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,153
If she can't transfer positions,
she'll have to stay at the window.

673
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,572
And even if she does,
it's still a problem.

674
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,742
If she transfers to a regular position,
she'll have to start from the bottom

675
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,412
and end up suffering as a senior clerk
for many more years.

676
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,456
But she's performing well,
so I think she still wants to.

677
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,875
Do you think
she'll get through the competition?

678
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,377
I don't think so.

679
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,257
Hey.

680
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,136
Ms. Ahn, you met our quota.

681
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,889
I knew you could do it.

682
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,560
Keep up the good work.

683
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,521
-Okay.
-Good. Keep it up.

684
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,656
But Mr. Ma. Didn't you like
Su-yeong, too, at first?

685
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,411
-Did she turn you down?
-No. Turned down? Me?

686
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,204
What? Of course not.

687
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,917
So what if Su-yeong is pretty?
Does that help her résumé?

688
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,337
No. She needs actual skills
to fill her résumé.

689
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,715
Let's be honest.
She's a high school graduate.

690
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,760
And she's just a service rep.
Her family isn't much, either.

691
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,261
Turned down by her? No way.

692
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,888
-Sounds like you were.
-I agree.

693
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,265
No way. Excuse me, but who told you that?

694
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,267
-I won't tell anyone you told me.
-You so did.

695
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,355
"Every single man

696
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,485
must have had feelings for her.

697
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:13,328
But anything that couldn't
instantly meet her emotional needs was…

698
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,834
considered utterly useless.

699
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,883
She discarded everything…

700
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,887
that she deemed as useless."

701
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,184
MADAME BOVARY

702
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,521
AHN SU-YEONG

703
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,148
Where are we meeting tomorrow?

704
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,779
I made a reservation

705
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,698
for seven o'clock
at the Tawon Hotel sushi restaurant.

706
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:00,125
Ha Sang-su.
So Gyeong-pil. Yang Seok-hyeon.

707
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,336
You three again!
Sitting right next to each other!

708
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,256
Sang-su, are you going through puberty?

709
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,841
Is this your rebellious stage?

710
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,343
You were doing so well. What happened?

711
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,511
I'm sorry, sir.

712
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,348
Even a rookie wouldn't make this mistake.

713
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,058
What's going on with you three?

714
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,704
DEPUTY MANAGER
NOH TAE-PYEONG

715
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,752
The balance is correct.

716
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,638
Thank you.

717
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,118
Thanks.

718
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,578
The balance is correct.

719
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,833
I'll be leaving, then.

720
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,254
Mr. Ha will make sure
that the balance is correct

721
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,257
before he leaves.

722
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,259
Good work, everyone.

723
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,389
Thank you.

724
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,335
Goodness, you've had such a day.

725
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,795
Thank you, Ms. Seo!

726
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,133
What just happened?
Is he leaving just like that?

727
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,565
What? Come on.

728
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,956
Hello.

729
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,836
LOCKER ROOM

730
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,848
Hey.

731
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,226
I had problems yesterday

732
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:33,189
because of the balance,
and then my phone broke.

733
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,695
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

734
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,029
Did you wait a long time?

735
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,130
What do you mean?

736
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,258
Does it have to be like that?

737
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,760
It was my mistake.

738
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,180
-Just do it like before.
-Okay, I get it.

739
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,765
No, I don't think so.

740
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,476
-What?
-Isn't this a team leader's job?

741
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,477
-Yes.
-Overtime work…

742
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,939
-No, you can do it.
-Did you get a poodle?

743
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,067
Since when was it like this?

744
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,862
-This one?
-Yes, that one.

745
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,705
The balance is correct.

746
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,333
-Okay.
-Good work.

747
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,879
-Great work today.
-Good job.

748
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,008
-The balance is correct.
-Okay, good work.

749
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,302
-Good work.
-Great job.

750
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,972
The balance is correct.

751
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,558
-Good job.
-Great work.

752
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,685
The balance is correct.

753
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,771
-All right!
-Perfect.

754
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,272
-Great job.
-Good work.

755
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,398
-Great work.
-Good.

756
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,108
-Goodbye.
-Okay, bye.

757
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,115
SENIOR CLERK
AHN SU-YEONG

758
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,007
AHN SU-YEONG

759
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,187
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

760
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,147
But aren't you being too harsh?

761
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,868
I said that I was sorry!

762
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,803
Hey, you. Are you there?

763
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,388
Ms. Ahn? Su-yeong!

764
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,556
Are you asleep?

765
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
I've lost it.

766
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,523
I've gone crazy.

767
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:27,321
I've lost it! I've gone crazy!

768
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,287
Eun-jeong, I borrowed your pen yesterday.

769
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,413
-Thank you.
-Sure.

770
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,919
-Hey.
-Hello.

771
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,020
Outside.

772
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,482
That doesn't mean they're dating.

773
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,901
Come on.

774
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:09,322
Ms. Ahn and the security guard,
Mr. Jeong, went to a park far from here

775
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,782
and sat across each other
while having lunch.

776
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,660
They're at least flirting or dating.

777
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,870
Jeez.

778
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,247
That snobby Ahn Su-yeong
turns everyone down,

779
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,791
but packs lunch boxes for Mr. Jeong?

780
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,754
But we don't know
if Ms. Ahn made it herself.

781
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,924
Then do you think Mr. Jeong did?

782
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,260
She turns down section chiefs
and assistant managers

783
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,887
for a rookie security guard?

784
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,431
I don't think she's in her right mind.

785
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,725
That's taking it a bit far,
don't you think?

786
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,936
And so what? They look great together.

787
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,480
Like attracts like, you know.

788
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,900
I know what I saw.
It wasn't just any kind of lunch.

789
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,027
Mr. Jeong kept blushing and smiling.

790
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,904
There was a really weird vibe.

791
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:53,324
I could tell something was up.
I'm certain of it.

792
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,077
Please excuse me.

793
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,037
Where are you going?

794
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,414
I have to get some cigarettes.

795
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,395
-Gosh.
-That's nice.

796
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,439
-Have another one.
-Thank you.

797
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,149
Right here.

798
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,653
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

799
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,198
-Eat up.
-Thank you. This is great.

800
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,366
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

801
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,743
-What a relief.
-It's great.

802
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,245
Try this one too.

803
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,414
All right, attention, please.

804
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,836
Now then.

805
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,588
We settled the accounts
for the first quarter.

806
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,008
We didn't reach our target performance,

807
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,636
but let's work as a team
and work harder in the next quarter.

808
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,223
You've all done a great job,
so I prepared this event today.

809
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,350
Everyone, clap!

810
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,644
Clap!

811
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,063
-All right!
-Event!

812
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,648
-Yes!
-Great!

813
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,571
What do you think about office romances?

814
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,781
Have another drink.

815
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,033
What about me?

816
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,200
Mr. Ma.

817
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:23,748
Well…

818
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,502
I feel like this team dinner
is especially great.

819
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,255
Is it thanks to our hot Mr. Jeong?

820
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:34,175
Yes, Mr. Jeong is quite handsome.

821
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,052
He kind of looks like me.

822
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,220
What are you talking about?

823
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,515
Your looks are just…
Gosh, I don't feel good all of a sudden.

824
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,975
I'll get you for that.

825
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,185
Wait.

826
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:48,022
Mr. Jeong looks like
an idol star, don't you think?

827
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,315
-Yes.
-No, not at all.

828
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,109
But Mr. Ha looks more manly.

829
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,821
You know, like Humphrey Bogart
in classical films.

830
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,281
-Don't you think?
-Hey.

831
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,950
Which type do you prefer, Ms. Ahn?

832
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,745
Do you like idol-star looks?

833
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,331
Or classical-movie-star looks?

834
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,002
I don't like classical films.

835
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,129
I see.

836
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,884
So Mr. Jeong is more your type
than Mr. Ha, right?

837
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,928
-I see.
-Okay.

838
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,514
Then what's your type, Mr. Jeong?

839
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,768
I also don't like classical films.

840
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,187
-See?
-Okay.

841
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,189
-Is this a coincidence?
-Hey.

842
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,692
Wait, Mr. Jeong and Ms. Ahn? Really?

843
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,362
-No way.
-Wait a second.

844
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,322
Really?

845
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,157
No way. Are you dating?

846
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,493
Stop that.

847
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,871
What's wrong with two young people dating?

848
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:46,914
Right?

849
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,582
If you two are dating,

850
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,669
then I think Mr. Lee here,
just wants to congratulate you.

851
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,045
It's not like that.

852
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,800
Are you sure?

853
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,563
Are you two really not dating?

854
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,486
No, we're really not.

855
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,445
Come on.

856
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,740
Stop denying it. We all know.

857
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,076
So nothing happened between you?

858
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,120
Be honest.

859
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,205
You're dating, right?

860
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,958
Right, just be honest with us.

861
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:36,422
Do you think we'll say you two are a joke
because you're dating a complete rookie?

862
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,382
Goodness, please stop.

863
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:42,344
Why are you turning
our fun dinner into a hearing?

864
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,472
So what if they're dating?
Will you give them matching rings?

865
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:49,518
When your superior is talking,
you need to be quiet.

866
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,811
Jeez.

867
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,271
So is that a no, Ms. Ahn?

868
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:55,941
That's right.

869
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,862
Mr. Jeong, you too?

870
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,990
We aren't dating.

871
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,786
If you say it's not true,
then that's that.

872
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,163
Okay, then.

873
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,708
If things work out between you two,
then let us know.

874
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,169
It's not like I'm a dumb cop or something.

875
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,923
I'm just a team leader
who wants to celebrate a great occasion.

876
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,967
What other motive could I possibly have?

877
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,135
-Mr. Lee.
-What?

878
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,263
You really shouldn't say "dumb cop."

879
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:31,602
What if Mr. Jeong passes the police exam,
becomes a detective, and then returns?

880
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:34,313
Do you think it's easy
to become a detective?

881
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,566
Even if he does,
he wouldn't do anything to me.

882
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,904
Mr. Jeong isn't the type
who would hold a grudge or hurt me.

883
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,949
Please excuse me. I need to go.

884
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:45,908
-Come on.
-Why?

885
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,243
-I had fun.
-Wait!

886
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,412
-Is it because I said dumb cop?
-No.

887
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,122
-We were having fun!
-Stay!

888
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,916
-Wait a second.
-Goodbye.

889
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,459
-You can't leave.
-Mr. Jeong.

890
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,627
-Don't go!
-Hey!

891
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,713
-Goodness.
-They never know when to stop.

892
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,340
-Darn it.
-He just left.

893
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,842
I'm sick and tired of this.

894
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,179
-I need to watch what I say.
-It was just a question.

895
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:09,431
Mr. Ha.

896
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,184
Why did you stop me back there?

897
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,313
What were you going to say if I hadn't?

898
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,484
Look, it doesn't matter
if Su-yeong dates Mr. Jeong or not.

899
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,487
They didn't deserve to be interrogated.

900
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:24,863
What was all that anyway?

901
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,075
Jeez. Mr. Lee and Mr. Ma.

902
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,077
Have they gone insane?

903
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,079
It's not the first time.

904
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:34,498
A love scandal
is their source of entertainment.

905
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,791
What about you?

906
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,004
You seem pretty pleased
with what Mr. Lee did.

907
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,422
Was it fun?

908
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:47,219
If you and Mr. Ma hadn't said anything,
this would've never happened.

909
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,014
I'm not the one who gave it away.

910
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,350
It was Mr. Ma,
who has the loosest tongue in this world.

911
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,857
And what would've happened
if you had intervened?

912
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,026
If you had stepped in and done something,

913
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,945
would she have felt
grateful, happy, or comforted?

914
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,530
I like her.

915
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,164
I like Su-yeong.

916
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,939
-Do you feel okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

917
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,524
-What about you?
-I'm good.

918
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,112
-Why you still here?
-This way.

919
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,072
See you.

920
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,324
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

921
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,909
-I'm going this way.
-Let's go.

922
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,077
Let's go.

923
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,246
-Let's go.
-I'm fine.

924
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,941
Are you okay?

925
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,694
What do you mean?

926
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:33,992
I mean, Mr. Ma and Mr. Lee
caused a scene in front of everyone.

927
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,078
It was as if they were insane.

928
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,044
But why are you asking me that, Mr. Ha?

929
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,590
-I--
-If you know it's offensive,

930
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,092
why bring it up again?

931
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,305
What made you think
that I'd want to talk about this with you?

932
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,142
If you think

933
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,561
that Mr. Lee was at fault,
then go tell him off.

934
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:04,982
He acted insane. So what?
Good for me for staying quiet?

935
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:07,901
Or are you asking
why I just sat and smiled like an idiot?

936
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,449
No, it's not that.

937
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,952
I was worried,
so I wondered if you were okay.

938
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,705
Of course, I'm fine.
What other choice do I have?

939
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,541
Should I report him to the head office?

940
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,172
It's more annoying
to see you acting like you're different.

941
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,552
You acted like everyone else back there,

942
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,973
so you should
keep quiet like them as well.

943
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,310
Hey. Ms. Ahn.

944
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,732
I'm sorry for not keeping my promise,

945
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:52,070
but don't you think
you've been too harsh on me?

946
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:57,576
I told you that I couldn't make it
because I couldn't verify the balance.

947
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,746
Is that why you think I'm upset with you?

948
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,123
Then why are you acting this way?

949
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,422
You know how I feel about you.

950
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,467
I don't want to know.

951
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,472
My feelings for Su-yeong were like…

952
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,184
the withdrawal mistake I'd made.

953
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,230
Anything else to say?

954
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,983
I shouldn't have given her my heart,

955
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,570
but I did it anyway.

956
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,078
I like you.

957
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,501
I said I like you.

958
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,009
I mean it.

959
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,680
I like you.

960
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,813
I know I didn't keep my promise that day.

961
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,066
I'm sorry. I truly am.

962
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,112
But I like you.

963
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,156
It was a mistake…

964
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:21,952
because the woman I liked…

965
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:27,874
Su-yeong was…

966
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,377
I'm afraid I have bad news.

967
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,301
They were right. I'm dating Mr. Jeong.

968
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,054
…a real bitch.

969
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,706
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

970
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,102
Are you serious?

971
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,188
Are you two really in a relationship?

972
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,732
Then what will happen to us?

973
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,736
What's the matter with you?
Is it because of Su-yeong?

974
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,863
Do you only study?

975
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:42,699
I'm sure you're too busy
to do anything else, but study.

976
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,411
My name is Park Mi-gyeong.
I'm the newest member to join Youngpo.

977
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,579
It's nice to meet everyone.

978
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,248
Sang-su. Don't you remember me?

979
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,417
Is there a reason why
you can't go on a blind date?

980
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,544
Are you really going on that blind date?

981
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,297
This is none of your business.

982
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,842
Am I not allowed to like her?

983
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:04,471
If you keep this up,
it won't help Su-yeong, either.

984
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:09,476
I'm in front of your house right now.
I need to tell you something.
