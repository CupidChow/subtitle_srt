00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,966
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,521
Large, dazzling, and unfamiliar.

3
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,152
That was my first impression of Seoul.

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,825
A place full of strangers, who lead lives…

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,039
that I know nothing about.

6
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,253
It's a bit run-down, but that's the house.

7
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,760
Strangely, though,
being at a loss actually gave me hope.

8
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
Come on in.

9
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:45,688
This house
is over 40 years old, so it's pretty old.

10
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,946
The sink needs to be fixed.

11
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,283
But the rent is cheap.
You can move in right away.

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,125
Old houses
have ridiculously wide balconies.

13
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,672
The fully furnished,
one-bedroom studio was better, right?

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,259
No, I'll take this.

15
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,304
What about your family?
Will you live here alone?

16
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes.

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,726
It's just me.

18
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,437
In the cold,

19
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,440
dark,

20
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,777
and worn-out house

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,031
that resembled me,

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,370
I felt relieved.

23
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,959
I believed that I could achieve anything

24
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,712
if I tried hard enough.

25
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,353
It's freezing. Hurry up.

26
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,942
I had to work like a dog
in order to just get by.

27
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,027
Are you here?

28
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,655
-Come on up.
-But I desperately wanted…

29
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,199
to live a better life.

30
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,886
2014 KCU BANK RECRUITMENT NOTICE
TELLER, CONTRACT WORKER

31
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,263
JOB OPENINGS

32
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
I thought that…

33
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,058
QUALIFICATIONS
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS

34
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,771
…working at the bank was my opportunity.

35
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,983
But then I realized…

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,320
SENIOR CLERK
AHN SU-YEONG

37
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,240
Number 17, how may I help you?

38
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,700
-…that people drew lines.
-Hello.

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,410
How may I help you?

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,537
-At times, it was subtle.
-It's about inheritance.

41
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,790
He can help you with inheritance affairs.

42
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,959
She's only in charge
of deposits and withdrawals.

43
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,460
-This way, please.
-Okay.

44
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,379
Other times, it was obvious.

45
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,805
And they see nothing wrong with that…

46
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,056
CONGRATULATIONS, GRADUATES

47
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,851
…'cause we come
from different backgrounds.

48
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,571
Some opportunities may seem fair…

49
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,739
KCU POSITION TRANSFER EXAM

50
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,700
… but they are
subtly discriminatory as well.

51
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,038
The questions were so unfair.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,165
They practically want us to fail.

53
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
No wonder the acceptance rate
is less than 10%.

54
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,837
-Those outside the line…
-This is so annoying.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,006
…can't easily cross over it.

56
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,093
There seems to be a gap
after you graduated high school.

57
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,430
I worked part-time, sir.

58
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,309
Your performance evaluation is excellent.

59
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,102
I did my best, sir.

60
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,187
Why do you want to switch job positions?

61
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,862
I want my hard work
to be acknowledged, sir.

62
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,034
How is it unfair?

63
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,201
It's anything but.

64
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,953
Why bother going to college

65
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,332
only to be treated the same way
as high school graduates?

66
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,416
To be honest,

67
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,004
I think service reps should get paid
much less than regular workers.

68
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,798
I agree. The result can't be
the same for both groups.

69
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,967
Now that's what I call unfair.

70
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,761
The only way not to get hurt

71
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,472
was to accept the truth.

72
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,557
Did you get home okay yesterday?

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,100
I think I drank too much.

74
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,939
And at this place,

75
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,069
I am definitely
on the other side of the line.

76
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,781
EPISODE 2

77
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,096
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?

78
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,805
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

79
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,727
I'm afraid I have bad news.

80
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,854
They were right. I'm dating Mr. Jeong.

81
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,448
Are you serious?

82
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,081
Are you two really in a relationship?

83
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,050
Then what about us?

84
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,222
-What do you mean?
-I mean…

85
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,519
Then what will happen to us?

86
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,865
Did we have something special?

87
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,705
You said you liked things
to be clear and defined.

88
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,876
I thought you said that
to clarify our relationship.

89
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,421
You had feelings for me too.

90
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,591
-And that day--
-You're the one who didn't show up.

91
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,385
It wasn't intentional.

92
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,695
I'm truly sorry

94
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,032
-that I couldn't make it that day.
-Do you mean that?

95
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,377
Are you really apologizing
because you made me wait?

96
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,398
Are you really dating…

97
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,544
Goal!

98
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,220
This isn't the Olympics.

99
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,140
This is a friendly game
among club members. Take it easy.

100
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,442
MR. SO-NOSY

101
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,743
Must I

102
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,246
Despise you?

103
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,959
Or should I blame myself?

104
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,920
Where are you?

105
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,088
Come rescue me!

106
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,215
Seok-hyeon won't let me go home!

107
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,759
I'm at the hockey rink.

108
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,344
I just want…

109
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,638
You have the energy
after the dinner gathering?

110
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,849
Just go home. He's doing that
because he knows you won't.

111
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,560
You're a heartless jerk.

112
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:32,483
It's okay to drink
and embarrass yourself when you're sad.

113
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,236
How would doing that change anything?

114
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,573
I can't understand people
who drink and become a mess.

115
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,417
What?

116
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,503
What is this?

117
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,463
You said she was your new girlfriend.

118
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,052
Jeong-eun…

119
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,596
I miss you. I'm sorry, Jeong-eun…

120
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
I really don't ask much from you guys.

121
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,942
But can at least one of you
sober up, please?

122
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,697
Sang-su, you stole that cardboard cutout
and said she was your girlfriend.

123
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,908
And Seok-hyeon,
you're the one who dumped her!

124
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,745
-But you're bawling every day.
-Jeong-eun…

125
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,709
I thought you said
drinking didn't solve anything

126
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,253
and that you didn't understand
people like him.

127
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,424
Gosh, I miss my mom.

128
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,094
-Drink this.
-Hey.

129
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,263
I'm not drunk.

130
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,600
-Let's have some hangover soup.
-We just did.

131
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,226
Right.

132
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,395
Then how about

133
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,939
we go for a third round
and catch the last subway?

134
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,026
This was our fifth round,
and the first subway will arrive soon.

135
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,403
-Wake up!
-I'm sorry, Jeong-eun.

136
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,030
Why did you drink so much?

137
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,157
You scare me more than he does.

138
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,286
I can't believe how sober you look
while completely intoxicated.

139
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,456
What's the matter with you?

140
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,876
Is it because of Su-yeong?

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,768
Are you serious?

142
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,941
Are you two really in a relationship?

143
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,152
Then what about us?

144
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,156
-What do you mean?
-Then what will happen to us?

145
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,236
What's he doing?

146
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,036
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.

147
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,005
-Who wants some snacks?
-Me.

148
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,340
-Thank you.
-Aren't they tasty?

149
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,009
-Thank you.
-Do you want some?

150
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,468
Good morning.

151
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,345
-Hi.
-Have some coffee.

152
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,681
What a nice surprise!

153
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
-What's gotten into you?
-Here.

154
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,643
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

155
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,478
-This isn't spiked, right?
-Good morning.

156
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,939
-Hello, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

157
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,525
-How about a morning coffee?
-Thanks, Mr. Ma.

158
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,235
Let me add a shot of love in it.

159
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,362
Actually, let me double that.

160
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,780
-That's great.
-Enjoy.

161
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
It's herbal tea.

162
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,131
Thank you.

163
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,265
Excuse me, Ms. Ahn.

164
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,477
About yesterday, I--

165
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,978
Yesterday? What do you mean?

166
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,117
-HR posted an announcement.
-Really?

167
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,119
Let me check.

168
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,418
Isn't it about time Mr. Ha left?

169
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,504
And Ms. Ahn, hasn't it been
three years for you?

170
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,217
Ms. Park Mi-gyeong from the Seocho branch

171
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,802
-is joining our PB Team.
-Really?

172
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,679
-And you're not leaving?
-Jeez.

173
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,389
I was looking forward to not seeing you.

174
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,307
I guess that won't happen. Darn it.

182
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,104
You're beautiful, miss.

183
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,108
How was today's massage?

184
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,860
Yes, it was good.

185
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,362
You have good skin to begin with.

186
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,281
So tell me.

187
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,408
-Will you keep working there?
-Mom.

188
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,120
You went to a top university
and got a job on your own. That's enough.

189
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,665
Why on earth do you want
to handle other people's money?

190
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,544
Nobody will say anything
if you get married and take it easy.

191
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,548
You have everything
that others could only wish for.

192
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,926
Refusing your parents' help

193
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,095
doesn't make you
a good daughter, you know.

194
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,222
Don't you agree, Ms. Han?

195
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,017
I'll bring out the tea.

196
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,439
How's this place?

197
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,817
It may look shabby,

198
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,527
but it's popular with my friends.

199
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,739
Everyone with skin problems comes here.

200
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,407
You should come here too.

201
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,826
If you want to get massages,

202
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,121
take Pilates classes,
and hang out with me,

203
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,664
you should quit the bank--

204
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,626
Mom, stop talking to me.
My facial mask is stretching out.

205
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,723
Raise your hand if you know why
your performance is the same

206
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,391
despite working like a dog.

207
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,273
Who came in last
in the General Consultation Team?

208
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,326
Is it Mr. Ha?

209
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,203
Is it you again?

210
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,372
I'm sorry, sir.

211
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,170
Mr. Ha.

212
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,382
I'd like a word with you.

213
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,848
Go on.

214
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
I won't see you out.

215
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
Open up.

216
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,608
Pardon?

217
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,610
I said open up.

218
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,992
Suck on it.

219
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
Squeeze out every last drop.

220
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,831
All of it. Don't waste any.
All the way. Good.

221
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,754
Sang-su.

222
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,798
-Yes?
-Do you know

223
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,301
what happens if I don't become
a branch manager in two years?

224
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
Yes, sir.

225
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:49,688
Our branch manager only tends to VIPs
and boosts his performance.

226
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:55,569
As for me, I just tend to small fry
and that reflects on my performance.

227
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,154
And that's not all.

228
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,282
You know how much
Mr. Lee looks down on me.

229
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,786
These days, he doesn't even bother
to run things by me.

230
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,080
He reports directly to the branch manager.

231
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:13,003
People wouldn't question it if he ended up
becoming a branch manager next year.

232
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,049
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,137
If this is my final position

234
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,140
during my 20 years here,

235
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,684
my wife will divorce me.

236
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,937
I'm barely keeping my head above water.

237
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,357
Sir.

238
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,156
My kids saved up
to buy me this on Father's Day

239
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,451
in the hopes it would help me
become a branch manager.

240
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,161
I don't share them with anyone.

241
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,038
-But you can have them.
-No, sir.

242
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,957
-You get me, right?
-I don't need them.

243
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,583
-Gosh.
-Just take them.

244
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,586
You'd better not share them
with those sly guys,

245
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,964
Mr. Lee or Mr. Ma.

246
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,217
Have one whenever you feel tired
from raising your performance.

247
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
Tell me if you need more.

248
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,512
Yes, sir.

249
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,350
Actually, can you give me one?

250
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,526
That's it. The other side too.

251
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,695
Do you not know
how to change a light bulb?

252
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,322
Hey, my parents didn't
make me do stuff like this.

253
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,450
What if I get electrocuted?
That would be painful.

254
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,535
Hey, you're done.

255
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,495
You could've zapped me.

256
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,247
Impressive skills, Ms. Ahn.

257
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,499
-All done.
-Thanks.

258
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,167
-Thank you.
-Hey.

259
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,302
Are you sure this is okay?

260
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,305
Of course. I'll be back.

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING
OF YOUR NEW BUSINESS

263
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,567
Thank you.

264
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,031
-Hello.
-Hello.

265
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,490
Please have some rice cakes.

266
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,200
Goodness!

267
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,785
Thank you.

268
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,746
-Thank you.
-It's still hot.

269
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,165
The new oyster gukbap place, right?

270
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,416
Come by for lunch.

271
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,293
I'll give bank employees a discount.

272
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,920
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

273
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,303
Hello.

274
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,515
Come by for lunch.

275
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
Here.

276
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,111
I only tended to five customers,
and it's already lunchtime.

277
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,490
Mortgage, house lease,
credit, mortgage, and credit.

278
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,034
Quite a variety, right?

279
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,289
How's the hangover?

280
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,167
I'm dying.

282
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,139
This is on the house.

283
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,724
Thank you, Uncle.

284
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,435
Is it okay if I call you "uncle"?

285
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,354
Of course. Eat up.

286
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,563
-Thank you.
-Come again.

287
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,690
-Come often.
-Thank you.

288
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,072
I really love Tongyeong oysters.

289
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,908
I like them raw,
and I like oyster gukbap too.

290
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,827
And oyster jeon--

291
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,704
I actually hate oysters.

292
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,008
Are you mad at the oyster?
Why are you picking at it?

293
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,139
What do you know about Mr. Jeong?

294
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,851
-Why, all of a sudden?
-Just because.

295
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,770
He's been here for about a month, right?

296
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm not sure. I'm not that interested
in our security guard.

297
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
Do you think they're really dating?

298
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,282
It doesn't seem like it
based on their reactions.

299
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,659
If having lunch together
means you're dating,

300
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,536
then I'd have 100 exes by now.

301
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,664
Are you going to tell him?

302
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,083
"I like her."

303
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,502
"I like Su-yeong."

304
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,005
Just shut up and eat.

305
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,428
Jeez.

306
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,597
Give me that.

307
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,682
Unbelievable.

308
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,442
They're for our customers.

309
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,568
Thank you.

00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,996

Mr. Ha.

313
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,606
Yes?

314
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,317
Here. I forgot to give this back.

315
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,027
Thank you.

316
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,362
Right.

317
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,494
-Wait.
-Yes?

318
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,748
You must be tired from studying.
Have one of these.

319
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,209
-Thank you.
-Sure.

320
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,923
How about we each have one right now?

321
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,717
Sure.

322
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,269
It must be stressful
preparing for the state exam.

323
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,895
So…

324
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,565
Do you also study on the weekends?

325
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:12,404
I'm sure you're too busy
to do anything else, but study.

326
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,535
I work out early in the morning
to prepare for the fitness test.

327
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,456
-Of course, working out is important.
-Right.

328
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,379
Then I guess
you don't have time to date anyone, right?

329
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,799
Yes, that's right.

330
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,051
Right?

331
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,724
I'm rooting for you. I'm sure you'll pass.

332
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,393
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

YOUNGPO CENTRAL TRADITIONAL MARKET

334
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,672
What are you talking about?

335
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,175
I was never told that!

336
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,885
I don't want to talk to you!

337
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,720
Call your boss!

338
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,138
-What's going on?
-I'll be here.

339
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,058
He's Ms. Bae's client.
It's about the principal loss.

340
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,392
-How much?
-Call your boss!

341
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,436
-Three million won.
-Bring me my money.

342
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,064
-You can't--
-Don't touch me!

343
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,483
-He's saying, "You never told me that."
-Don't touch me.

344
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,986
-"You'd better pay me back."
-Call your boss. I was never told that.

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,946
-Where's Mr. Noh?
-I want my three million won!

346
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,741
Both he and the branch manager are out.

347
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,950
Don't play dumb!

348
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,702
He insists on acting that way

349
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,746
-until they come.
-I don't care. Call your boss.

350
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,373
-I can't talk to you.
-Sir--

351
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,917
I told you not to touch me!

352
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,963
The camera is recording this.
Don't touch me, or I'll report you.

353
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,341
I guess we won't be clocking out on time.

354
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,347
I want my three million won back.

355
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,017
How dare you ignore your customer?

356
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,732
Are you just going to watch?

357
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,610
Should we call the police?

358
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,114
And let word of this get out?

359
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,365
Of course not.

360
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,576
What if he posts about his arrest
on the Financial Supervisory Service site?

361
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
Then what should we do?

362
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,789
We can't stay here all night.

363
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,542
When can I clock out?
I have plans tonight.

364
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,710
What kind of answer are you expecting?

365
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,005
-That you can go ahead and leave?
-No.

366
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,842
The balance is correct.

367
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:39,968
Okay.

368
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,647
What?

369
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,904
Who are you? Are you the boss here?

370
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,074
I'm going to kneel here until you get up.

371
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,620
What? I don't want that!
I just want my money back!

372
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,082
You know that's not possible,
and that's why you're furious.

373
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,834
I'll stay here until you feel better.

374
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,919
Stop this nonsense!

375
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,255
I won't leave
without my three million won.

376
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,882
Bring it to me.

377
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,884
I won't get up until you do.

378
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:27,390
Is this funny to you?
Just give me back my money!

379
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,606
Do whatever you want,
and I'll do the same.

380
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,860
Jeez.

381
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,033
So is it possible or not?

382
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,410
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please wait a moment.

383
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm sorry. It's his probation period,
so he must've made a mistake.

384
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,920
This won't take long, so let me help.

385
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,213
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

386
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,053
DEPOSITORY OPERATION MANUAL

387
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,484
I'm sorry, Ms. Ahn.

388
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,824
These are the list of mistakes I made
when I first started working here

389
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,117
and their solutions.

390
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,705
AHN SU-YEONG

391
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,792
I made tons of mistakes too.

392
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,796
They say it's a given for clerks to make
mistakes for the first three years.

393
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,881
Don't take it to heart.

394
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,676
HAVE ANSWERS READY FOR POSSIBLE COMPLAINTS

395
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,429
Thank you.

396
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,585
Jeez.

397
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,420
-What?
-Gosh.

398
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,425
Ms. Seo?

399
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,343
-Gosh.
-Ma'am.

400
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,763
Come on. Let's go.

401
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,822
Seriously? Look at you all.

402
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,742
What a beautiful sight.

403
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,003
I knew Su-yeong was tenacious.

404
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,255
But that was still impressive.

405
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,799
How was that impressive?

406
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,218
I had to kneel because of her.

407
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,513
We get to go home, thanks to you.

408
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,641
Thanks, Su-yeong.

409
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,851
You didn't have to do that, you know.

410
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,354
I wanted to go home too.

411
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,399
Anyway, thank you. This was all my fault.

412
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,110
I'm leaving now. See you tomorrow.

413
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,904
-Good job today.
-Goodbye.

414
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,990
-Right.
-Thank goodness.

415
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,326
How about a blind date, Su-yeong?

416
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,497
My ex and I got back together,
so I can't go.

417
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,459
I mean, it has nothing
to do with what you did for me today.

418
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,337
He works at Samjeon,
and he's good-looking.

419
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,548
I can't go because he and my ex
have mutual friends.

420
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,384
Are you interested?

421
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,971
A blind date?

422
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,431
No, that's okay.

423
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,684
What? Why not?

424
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,019
Why not go?

425
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:05,149
She said he works at Samjeon.
Is there a reason why you can't go?

426
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,362
Are you already taken?

427
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,990
Or are you casually seeing someone?

428
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,952
What? Have you been seeing someone?

429
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,204
Who is he? A colleague?

430
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,330
When is it?

431
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,416
Next weekend.

432
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,586
-I'll go.
-Really?

433
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,630
I'll go on the blind date.

434
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,009
That's great.

435
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,220
That's great.

436
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,450
CHAPTER 3
INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS

437
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,044
MR. SO-NOSY

438
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,306
Good shot, Sang-su.

439
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,434
But it's not good for me.

440
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,562
Gosh, that went far.

441
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,940
You need to practice how to lose
without making it look obvious.

442
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,401
Beating the branch manager
will do you no good.

443
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,861
Why are you dressed like that?

444
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,991
Should I just quit the bank
and open up a driving range?

445
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,411
Should I go on a blind date?

446
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you get an offer?

447
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,585
No, it's not that.

448
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,837
Then whom will you go
on a blind date with?

449
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,132
Instead of that,

450
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,260
how about we go on a date
with pork belly and soju?

451
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,638
I'm sick of drinking.

452
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,099
It's not just any pork.
It's Jeju pork belly.

453
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:05,645
I don't care. I'll take a rain check.
I have a high school reunion.

454
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,647
You usually don't go. What gives?

455
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,318
I'm going there to raise my performance.

456
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,075
In that case, leave it with me.

457
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,868
Right here.

458
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,703
Yank out your pride and leave it behind.

459
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,207
Shut up. You're not making any sense.

460
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,294
Sang-su, remember who we are.

461
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,004
We're just bank clerks.

462
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,509
We don't need any pride. Come on.

463
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,772
You look good.
Is it because you're getting married?

464
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,941
Or could it be
thanks to your future father-in-law?

465
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,360
What do you mean?
Does he have his own business?

466
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,822
He owns some interior designing companies.

467
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,741
His mom-in-law is a vice principal,
his sister-in-law practices law.

468
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,827
That family has both wealth and honor.

469
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,205
Hey, I said she's only in law school.

470
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,666
-Come on.
-They're just an average family.

471
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,127
Hey, being average is the best.

472
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,337
-Right.
-I agree.

473
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,841
Hey, you should get
your home loan from Sang-su.

474
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,510
What?

475
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,430
-Are you interested?
-Go on.

476
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,681
Should I?

477
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,852
Hey. Since we're on the topic,
take a look at this.

478
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,103
Let me see that.

479
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,606
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

480
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,066
This is a pretty good product.

481
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,235
The rate of return is not bad at all.

482
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
An investment trust?

483
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,572
-What is this?
-Beats me.

484
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,915
Come on. We're all friends.
Help me out here.

485
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,042
-All right.
-Take a good look at it.

486
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,754
How much do you get
in commission for this?

487
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,050
What?

488
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,345
I'm constructing a new building.

489
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,974
It's the place where you used to live.

490
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm going to demolish it
and put up a new one.

491
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,021
That's right.

492
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,814
-You two lived in the same building.
-Yes.

493
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,191
That's right.

494
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,068
Right.

495
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,617
That's right.

496
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,453
It was pretty much underground.

497
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,537
This is only temporary.

498
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,582
We won't be living here for long.

499
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,834
We lived on the first floor
that got no sun.

500
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,465
The address read "Gangnam,"
but it was anything but fancy.

501
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,469
My mom repeatedly told me
that it was temporary,

502
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,682
but we lived there
for more than five years.

503
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,063
And thanks to that experience,
I became a top student.

504
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:01,237
I didn't fit in with the other kids
who were born wealthy.

505
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,115
That's why I studied.

506
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,537
And I promised myself
to never live that poor again.

507
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,298
You know what?

508
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,758
I'll move our company
and employees' accounts to your bank.

509
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,718
-Gosh.
-Great.

510
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,473
Really? Thanks.

511
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,976
It's nothing. Friends should
help each other out.

512
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,771
But hey, are you thinking about
getting married at all?

513
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,651
Of course. I want to marry
a nice, average woman.

514
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,237
-Right.
-Average is the best.

515
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,196
Let's drink.

516
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,823
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

517
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,783
-Let's meet up more often.
-Sure.

518
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,686
Seriously?

519
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,275
Everyone! Attention!

520
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:29,658
Mr. Ha, right here,
finally did something terrific.

521
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
Applause, please.

522
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:38,292
I heard you went to an elite school.
Your friends sure are different.

523
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,668
Well done.

524
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,883
When is the new assistant manager coming?

525
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,387
She's going to show up exactly on time.
How do we feel about that?

526
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,555
Don't be mean now.

527
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,059
Getting a new PB Team worker
will take a burden off your shoulders.

528
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,770
No way. Check this out.

529
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,939
-This is the new employee.
-What is it?

530
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,357
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

531
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,983
-What?
-No way.

532
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,236
-Gosh.
-Look at her.

533
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,321
DESIGNATED PARKING SPACE

534
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,211
She has a different vibe
than our Goddess of Youngpo.

535
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,295
-She looks like me.
-Wait.

536
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,089
-Right?
-Don't irritate me like that.

537
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,258
-Someone this hot is coming here?
-Are you excited?

538
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,759
She's seriously coming here?

539
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,094
Good morning.

540
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,349
My name is Park Mi-gyeong,
and this is my first day

541
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,809
at the Youngpo branch.

542
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,228
I'll greet you officially
after I get changed.

543
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,939
-Okay.
-Okay then.

544
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,233
Where's the locker room?

545
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,485
That way.

546
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,712
Assistant Manager Park Mi-gyeong
is from the Seocho branch.

547
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,797
She'll be joining me in the PB Team.

548
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,092
-Why don't you introduce yourself?
-Okay.

549
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,096
My name is Park Mi-gyeong.
I'm the newest member to join Youngpo.

550
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,723
It's nice to meet everyone.

551
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,807
Applause, please.

552
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,351
Thank you.

553
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,020
-Let's work hard.
-Okay.

554
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,271
Thank you.

555
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,689
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

556
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,153
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

557
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,696
Did you see?

558
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,448
Unbelievable.

559
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,122
Here.

560
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,291
Thank you for the meal.

561
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,084
It was expensive and delicious.

562
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,045
I'll treat everyone often.

563
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,880
Is that a custom-made handbag?

564
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,300
This? It's called marquage.

565
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,011
I like to draw pretty designs.

566
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,472
Doodling on luxury bags
must be your hobby.

567
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:02,144
You have great skin, by the way.
Do you go to spas and get facials done?

568
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,649
I go with my mom every now and then.
I'm too lazy to go often.

569
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,068
With your mom?

570
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,405
Let us help you in any way we can.
All you have to do is ask.

571
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,369
How are the employees at this branch?

572
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,996
Our branch manager is like a king.

573
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,917
And he married a wealthy woman,
so he's been jumping up the ladder.

574
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,503
Mr. Noh is anxious
as he has to voluntarily resign

575
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,130
if he doesn't become
a branch manager in two years.

576
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,342
He's had to struggle a lot
after marrying his dirt-poor wife.

577
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,052
But he's a good person.

578
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,973
Just watch out for TOM.

579
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,684
TOM?

580
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,061
It's short for "Two Obnoxious Men."

581
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,481
One of them is Mr. Lee.

582
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,984
He takes credit for good
and blames others for the bad.

583
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,027
Mr. Noh has no shame.

584
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,739
I planned out everything myself.
You saw me do that, right?

585
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,741
The other one is Mr. Ma.

586
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,579
-He's not evil, but he's an opportunist.
-Calm down. You're too tense.

587
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,622
And these three are the most popular.

588
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,874
They made so many mistakes as rookies…

589
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,418
…they were called the Three Idiots.

590
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,296
Hey, is this supposed to be 80%?

591
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,467
Let's see…

592
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,639
Hey, does this mean 80%?

593
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,852
-Where did you get this?
-From him.

594
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,354
-I gave this to you.
-And I gave it to you.

595
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,482
-Exactly.
-It was originally from me.

596
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,027
You idiots.

597
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,154
So is it 80%?

598
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,157
I'm sure it is.

599
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,494
And lastly--

600
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,510
That's Senior Clerk Ahn Su-yeong.

601
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,429
She's a service rep, just like me

602
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:05,142
-and is called the Goddess of Youngpo.
-Goddess? That's stretching it a bit.

603
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,020
Guys fall for her
every now and then, but that's it.

604
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,271
You get it, right?

605
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,815
Are you jealous, Ji-yun?

606
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,948
Our banking app will be modified.

607
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,953
The president wants the employees
to come up with suggestions.

608
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:31,835
And the branch manager wants you two
to be in charge of this project.

609
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,673
But didn't you say we should focus
on achieving high performance?

610
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,300
Yes, but that's a given.

611
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,136
Sang-su.

612
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,639
Didn't you want to move up to HQ?

613
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,975
This is worth many points.

614
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,937
And the president
will present the reward himself.

615
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,647
Is it still a no? Should I do it?

616
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,650
-I'll do it.
-Good.

617
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,320
Sir. If we're going
to be at the center twice a week,

618
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,947
what about our main duties?

619
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,242
Then someone will have
to substitute for you.

620
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,829
Let's see. Sang-su, ask Seok-hyeon--

621
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,290
Ask Mr. Ma to take over for you.

622
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:17,339
As for you, ask Ms. Ahn to take over.
She used to help the PB Team.

623
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,632
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,054
Go ahead and talk things over.

625
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,683
Hi, honey.
No, I answered as soon as it rang.

626
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,311
Should we read up
and talk again after work?

627
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,606
Sure.

628
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,903
Sang-su.

629
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,072
Pardon?

630
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,034
Don't you remember me? It's Mi-gyeong.

631
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,664
I majored in business administration.

632
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,712
You're…

633
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,758
Hey, Gyeong-pil.

634
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,678
Ms. Park, here, went
to the same school as us.

635
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,930
You're So Gyeong-pil, right?

636
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,810
-Hi there.
-Since it's been a while,

637
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,188
how about we have dinner together?

638
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,231
Sure. You're free, right?

639
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,358
I have a memorial service today.

640
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,569
Let me take a rain check.

641
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,406
What do you like to eat?

642
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,408
Why don't you choose?

643
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,499
-See you later.
-See you.

644
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,502
Ms. Park, the handover files
are on your desk.

645
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,462
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

646
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,465
And this is yours.

647
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,426
Thank you, Su-yeong.

648
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,899
Did you like her too?

649
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,484
Who?

650
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:01,985
Ms. Ahn.

651
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,033
I hear she's the Goddess of Youngpo.

652
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,412
What do you mean?

653
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,415
She's pretty, though.

654
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,296
You changed your style, didn't you?
That's why I didn't recognize you.

655
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,422
Well…

656
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,259
Back then, I was rebellious.

657
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,386
Toward whom?

658
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,180
Just someone.

659
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,226
I haven't had this in a while.
I feel nostalgic.

660
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,019
Why haven't you?

661
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,939
There weren't many opportunities
after graduation.

662
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,984
So don't eat a lot. Let me have the rest.

663
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,113
Fine. You can have it all.

664
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,741
Have some more.

665
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,414
My scholarship was at stake,
and he wasn't picking up.

666
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,207
So I went to his place.

667
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,085
With a toothpick in his mouth,

668
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,671
he said, "You deserve a B minus,
not a B plus."

669
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,298
And he threatened to lower my grade.

670
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,010
That professor was notorious
for lowering your grade if you complained.

671
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,178
What? You knew that?

672
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,430
Of course.

673
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:15,142
Then you should've told me!

674
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,728
It's all your fault.

675
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,187
How is that my fault?

676
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,648
You should have told me.

677
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,450
That's the branch manager's spot.

678
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,618
I know.

679
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,203
The branch managers had a meeting at HQ.

680
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:40,542
I'll park in the public lot tomorrow.
Hop in. I'll drop you off.

681
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,353
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

682
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,022
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING
OF YOUR NEW BUSINESS

683
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,578
This is a nice car.

684
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,706
I'm paying it off over a hundred years.

685
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,085
I think it's the same model
as our branch manager's.

686
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,419
But his is black.

687
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:29,091
Seriously? That's so annoying.
I'm going to get a new car, then.

688
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,431
Gosh, you're so considerate.

689
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,651
I felt hurt when you didn't recognize me.
We were in the same major, after all.

690
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,405
When I returned to school later,
you had already graduated,

691
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,614
so it was only natural.

692
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,616
What did you do after graduating?

693
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,411
I went on a trip abroad.

694
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,621
-Where?
-Türkiye.

695
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,915
Gosh, Türkiye is a lovely country.

696
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,459
Did you see the sunset from Hagia Sophia?

697
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,211
-Have you been to Türkiye?
-Yes.

698
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,213
I went to Italy afterward.

699
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,340
I've never been to Italy.

700
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,092
You should go next time.

701
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,052
But the pasta here is better.

702
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:20,225
Right, so any ideas on what to write
for the app improvement proposal?

703
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,269
I can't think of anything right now.

704
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,648
I think HQ has an ulterior motive
for this competition.

705
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,775
Like what?

706
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,820
I don't think modifying
or evaluating the app

707
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,031
is what they really want from us.

708
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,494
Then I'll write up a draft.
We can talk afterward.

709
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,829
Sounds good.

710
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,462
Good to see you again.
Thanks for dropping me off.

711
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,297
I look forward to working with you.

712
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,216
I should be saying that to you, Ms. Park.

713
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,054
Right then. See you tomorrow, Mr. Ha.

714
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,642
-Bye.
-Okay.

715
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,186
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

716
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,046
Just got home. Today was fun.

717
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,803
I HAD FUN TOO

718
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,402
AHN SU-YEONG

719
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,364
LET'S NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TOMORROW

720
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,881
CONTACTS

721
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,091
AHN SU-YEONG

722
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,609
I'd like to take out a housing loan.

723
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,736
A housing loan?

724
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,864
Normally, you can get up to 80%
of the down payment,

725
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,199
but you have to speak to
the Loan Team about the details.

726
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,035
Can't you just do it instead?

727
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,830
I'm sorry, but I'm only in charge
of deposits and withdrawals.

728
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:29,915
Let's see.

729
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,792
Mr. Ha?

730
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,879
This customer wants a housing loan.
Can you speak with him?

731
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,047
Sure.

732
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,090
This way, please.

733
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,017
Number 312, how may I help you?

734
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,519
How much money do you need, sir?

735
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,772
-About 250 million won.
-Okay, got it.

736
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,857
-Can I see your ID, please?
-Yes.

737
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,942
Okay.

738
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,157
My mom was thrilled
when I became a bank clerk.

739
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,327
But I bet she never knew
I'd be so busy that I'd skip meals.

740
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,621
Up until recently,

741
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,207
my mom thought bank employees
clocked out at 4 p.m.

742
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,211
Four is actually an unlucky number for us
because that's when our job really begins.

743
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,508
The position transfer notice
will be up soon. Are you doing it?

744
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,636
You have to have worked
at least three years. I'm a bit short.

745
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:25,971
What about you, Su-yeong?

746
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,973
I'm going to pass.

747
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,642
You'll soon be
a section chief anyway, right?

748
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,020
If you transfer, you'll have to start
from the bottom again.

749
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,272
You should apply for it.

750
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,234
If not, you'll be stuck
and won't know what to do.

751
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,528
What do you mean? I don't agree.

752
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,571
I love being a teller.

753
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:48,201
Still, you should know how to manage
loan applications as a clerk.

754
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,538
She's also helping
the General Consultation Team.

755
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,665
This is just her main job.

756
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,875
Right.

757
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,587
Mr. Noh wants you
to help out with the PB Team.

758
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,839
Yes, I heard.

759
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,757
Let's talk more about that later.

760
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,634
Give me your number.

761
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,434
Mr. Ha!

762
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,227
Come and join us.

763
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,812
-Come here.
-No, thank you.

764
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,397
-Come on. Hurry up.
-It's okay.

765
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,356
Come join us.

766
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,192
Just come in. Hurry up.

767
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,402
Okay.

768
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,779
Come and sit.

769
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,244
-This is good.
-It is.

770
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,871
It's really tasty.

771
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,125
-Your chopsticks.
-Right.

772
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,877
You didn't forget this weekend, right?

773
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,337
This weekend? What's happening?

774
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,465
I'm setting her up on a blind date.

775
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,550
He works at Samjeon.

776
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,804
I sent him your photo,
and he's dying to date you already.

777
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,473
I didn't forget.

778
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,642
Are you finally going to get married?

779
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,151
Thanks.

780
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,862
What was that?

781
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,698
What's going on between you guys?

782
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,160
I know you've been
preparing for the competition,

783
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:15,663
and now, you're handing her tissues.

784
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,956
It's not like that.

785
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,336
Don't lie. I can see through you.
I can see that you're dating.

786
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,713
Tell me. Do you think
we'll be happily married?

787
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,717
-You suit each other.
-You really do.

788
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,135
You should just date.

789
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,138
-Come on.
-Excuse me.

790
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,435
-Gosh.
-I can't believe this.

791
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,436
Eat up.

792
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,146
Eat up.

793
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,065
-Eat up.
-Okay.

794
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,401
Please have some.

795
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,986
Thank you.

796
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,966
It's not true. Mi-gyeong is…

797
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,221
There's nothing between Ms. Park and me.

798
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,683
-Okay.
-Wait.

799
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,314
Are you really going on that blind date?

800
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,488
You said you were dating Mr. Jeong.
But now, you're going on a blind date.

801
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,240
It just doesn't make sense.

802
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,327
This is none of your business.

803
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,958
Why are you…

804
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,045
Is there another reason?

805
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:54,137
Is there a reason that I'm not aware of?

806
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,223
No, there isn't.

807
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,062
So, good luck with Ms. Park.

808
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,815
Do you mean that?

809
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,611
Do you really want me

810
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,655
to date Ms. Park?

811
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,702
Yes.

812
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,039
You two look good together.

813
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,310
AHN SU-YEONG
JEONG JONG-HYEON

814
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,145
BLIND DATE?

815
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,605
A blind date?

816
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,538
Mr. Ha, I know you're in there. Open up.

817
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:07,085
If you don't come out, I'll barge in.

818
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,804
Why do you keep showing up here?

819
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:22,058
Let's drink our loneliness away.

820
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,033
Hey, let's do this.
Let's drink until we drop.

821
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,743
Jeez.

822
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,955
I'm not drinking.

823
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,499
Why not?

824
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,294
Don't be a party pooper.

825
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,964
What's the problem?
You can tell me anything.

826
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,215
It's nothing.

827
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,135
I can see the torment in your eyes.

828
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,721
-What's Seok-hyeon doing?
-He's on a blind date.

829
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,849
A blind date?

830
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:07,604
People should try to meet others naturally
instead of going on blind dates.

831
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,189
He met his ex naturally,
and look what happened.

832
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,361
He wants to meet a well-off woman.
Her father is the vice president of FSS.

833
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,155
Jeez.

834
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,909
Is that right, though?

835
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,707
Should two people
from similar backgrounds get married

836
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,834
just to maintain
the lifestyles they're used to

837
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,338
even though they're not in love?

838
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:38,676
Who said there's no love?
Those people can fall in love too.

839
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,346
Sang-su.

840
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,643
Love can't conquer all
in this awful world.

841
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,145
Money is more powerful than you think.

842
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,319
Sure, there are people who try to raise
their status through marriage.

843
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,408
I heard Su-yeong's blind date
works at Samjeon.

844
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,662
How did you find out?

845
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,664
There are no secrets at work.

846
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,175
So that's why you're depressed.

847
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,053
If it works out, then good for her.

848
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,514
If he falls for her, that is.

849
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,784
She really is pretty, that's for sure.

850
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,789
After coming to Youngpo,

851
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,625
guess what the other trainees
asked me about?

852
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,087
"Is Ahn Su-yeong pretty?"

853
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,425
And yes, she was.

854
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,426
But the problem is

855
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:06,556
even dating someone in college
could end in a four-year headache.

856
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,684
I didn't want to be reckless
and weighed my options.

857
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:11,978
So?

858
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,022
Am I not allowed to like her?

859
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,693
How serious do you feel about her?

860
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,450
Would you consider marrying her?

861
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,414
People at the bank even gossip

862
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,500
about those who dated
back at the training institute.

863
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,919
What if you two break up?

864
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,299
They'll say you're the guy who seduced
a cute teller and then dumped her.

865
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,594
Will you be able to handle that?

866
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,732
So just forget about her.

867
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:05,281
If you keep this up,
it won't help Su-yeong, either.

868
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,194
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong?

869
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,696
-Yes.
-Hello.

870
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,240
Please sit down.

871
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,161
You're here early.

872
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,580
But you came even earlier.

873
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,749
I didn't want you to wait.

874
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,394
PARK MI-GYEONG

875
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,354
Sang-su, I sent you the draft.

876
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,490
Let me serve you.

877
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,243
So?

878
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,871
Am I not allowed to like her?

879
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,542
How serious do you feel about her?

AHN SU-YEONG

881
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,119
And what if we do?

882
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,459
I don't like undefined relationships.

883
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:29,717
It's obvious that you majored in fashion
from the way you dress.

884
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,553
That's not me.

885
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,351
Ms. Kim Ji-yun was the one
who was supposed to be here today.

886
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,227
That was her major.

887
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,024
My apologies.

888
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,943
That's okay.

889
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,239
Then what was your major?

890
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,707
I didn't go to college.

891
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,585
I only have a high school diploma.

CALLING

893
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,466
I'm in front of your house right now.

894
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,343
I need to tell you something.

895
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,694
Sir, can you please drive faster?

896
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:54,820
Yes, ma'am.

CALL

899
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,477
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

900
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,125
This woman told this man
who confessed his feelings for her,

901
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,293
she's dating someone else.

902
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,420
That means she has a boyfriend, right?

903
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:19,924
I made it
because I knew you were opening today.

904
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:21,717
What's with the look?

905
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,260
I just think you're cool.

906
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,430
If you want to thank me,
then let's be friends.

907
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,724
It's because I like you, Ms. Ahn.

908
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,100
Why here?

909
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,729
You could've gone anywhere else.
Why'd you have to come here of all places?

910
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,815
So what have you been up to?

911
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,776
You were like that in college.

912
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,861
Why don't you ever date?

913
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,406
Is it fun?
Toying with my emotions, that is.
