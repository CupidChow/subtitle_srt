THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,473
Can I have your account number
as well as your ID, please?

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,976
CLERK
AHN SU-YEONG

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,895
Hello, ma'am.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,106
-How may I help you?
-I want to open a savings account.

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,317
May I see your ID, please?

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,488
She was a part-time worker
before becoming a service rep.

8
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,281
I told them to give it to me.

9
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,205
What else was I supposed to tell them?

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,498
Seriously.

11
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,459
Ms. Ahn, can we sit here?

12
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,795
-Sure.
-Why are you eating alone?

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,256
She was an outsider
from the very beginning.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,300
She never really befriended anyone.

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,679
She was tenacious and hardworking
to the point that it shocked everyone.

16
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,723
She only cared about her performance.

17
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,393
Your performance evaluation is excellent.

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,395
I did my best, sir.

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,481
Why do you want to switch job positions?

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,239
I want my hard work
to be acknowledged, sir.

21
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,075
But it's not easy to get transferred.

22
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,620
Out of thousands of applicants,
only 200 get transferred.

23
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,665
And there are barely
any high school graduates.

24
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,008
KCU BANK
AHN SU-YEONG

25
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,206
Ms. Ahn reported him, didn't she?

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,970
To be honest, she and I aren't that close.

27
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,226
Mr. Yuk? Coercion?

28
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,063
He always took great care of Ms. Ahn.

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,276
He was very considerate of her.

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,321
-Anonymity is guaranteed, right?
-Yes.

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,537
Are you saying Ms. Ahn
reported Mr. Yuk for coercive behavior?

32
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,335
So it wasn't about
having an affair or anything like that?

33
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,170
No, it wasn't.

34
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,924
It must've been so difficult for her.

35
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,134
So what did you guys say?

36
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,680
The interview was confidential.

37
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,643
I just told them the truth, of course.

38
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,357
Don't tell me you sided with Mr. Yuk
just because you dislike her.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,609
What do you take me for?

40
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,361
Do I look like the type of person

41
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,197
who would abuse his position,
jump on the bandwagon, and tell lies?

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,119
Do you think the bank will take her side
when Mr. Yuk is about to retire?

43
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,621
She shouldn't have done that.

44
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,582
She did something completely useless.

45
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,168
We'll only know for sure
once we hear the result.

46
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,922
By the way, Mr. Yuk
doesn't know about this yet, does he?

47
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,191
Ahn Su-yeong!

48
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,404
Youâ€¦

49
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,791
Please calm down before you talk, sir.

50
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,652
Come see me in my office. This instant.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
Will you be okay?

52
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,004
Yes, I'll be all right.

53
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,149
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

54
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,162
What have you done?

55
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,958
When did I ever coerce you?
Retract your statement this instant.

56
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,503
I want a formal apology.

57
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,379
For what?

58
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,592
I did nothing that warranted an apology.
Why would I do that to you?

59
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,929
I felt bad that the others
looked down on you,

60
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,098
so I took care of you
because we're family here.

61
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,308
Who else would've done that for you?

62
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,393
What other branch manager
would care this much?

63
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,022
I was nothing but considerate toward you
whenever we met our clients.

64
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,025
I even gave you cab fare
after every meeting.

65
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,321
What is this?

66
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,993
I've never felt grateful for the cab fare.

67
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,372
It felt like compensation
for your unjust treatment.

68
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,875
You can have your money back.

69
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,097
You actually saved all this?

70
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,811
Did you ever truly respect me?

71
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,818
Then why did I get a low score
on my performance evaluation?

72
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,863
I had the best performance,

73
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,031
so why did I receive
the lowest bonus?

74
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,455
I had to accept it,
given my position at this bank.

75
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,877
But doing so changed nothing.

76
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,593
So I decided to do something about it.

77
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,346
Please apologize to me.

78
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,789
Mr. Jeong, wash my car.

79
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,625
Yes, sir.

80
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,341
I have knots in my stomach,
and I can't breathe.

81
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,010
So what happens now?

82
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,722
Will he get fired
if he's found guilty of coercion?

83
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,686
There's a higher chance
that Ms. Ahn will get sacked instead.

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,773
Knowing all that, she still reported him.

85
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,917
Why did you do that?

86
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,587
What if the others get the wrong idea?

87
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,173
I'm the least of your worries right now.

88
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,843
What did Mr. Yuk say?

89
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
I can take care of this myself.

90
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,187
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ha.

91
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,614
I'm off to a site inspection.

92
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,949
All right.

93
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,955
Everyone, let's get ready to open.

94
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,164
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,959
Sang-su.

96
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,920
When are you coming back?

97
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,506
I'll have to see.

98
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,510
Okay, then. Bye.

99
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
Bye.

100
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,066
Su-yeong, are you okay?

101
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,700
Yes, I am. Don't worry.

102
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,550
You know how to place orders online.
Mobile banking isn't that hard either.

103
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,510
Then please show me how.

104
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,141
You can join an association through this.
It also has voice recognition.

105
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,771
Let me help you log in.
The menu should be easy to follow.

106
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,022
But please let me know

107
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
-if you have any problems.
-Okay.

108
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,983
Isn't she incredible?

109
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,278
"You can join
an association through this."

110
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,656
"It also has voice recognition."

111
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,450
How can she act like nothing's wrong?

112
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,786
That's what you call being professional.

113
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,704
She scares me now.

114
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,289
I think Ms. Ahn--

115
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,752
I think Ms. Ahn should come and join us.

116
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,128
Sit down and eat.

117
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,421
He was going to call you.

118
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,049
-Come sit down.
-The food is good.

119
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,801
No, thank you.

120
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,803
She and I have somewhere to go.

121
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,856
Doesn't this relieve your stress?

122
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,566
It's like shooting a gun.

123
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,069
The curved parts are hard to do properly.

124
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,030
It won't show even if you go out of line.

125
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,284
No matter how crooked it is,
it'll still be art. That's its charm.

126
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,248
I'm sorry you had to skip lunch
because of me, Ms. Park.

127
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,084
Call me by my name if you really feel bad.

128
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,754
Okay, Mi-gyeong.

129
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,092
Gosh, I just got
butterflies in my stomach.

130
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,181
Su-yeong.

131
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,981
I just wanted to say
that everything will work out.

132
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,443
Thank you.

133
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,371
Excuse me.

134
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,957
Is the branch manager in?

135
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,376
He's away from his desk today.

136
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,587
How may I help you?

137
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,298
-There are others--
-That's okay. I'll come by again.

138
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,265
-Here, Su-yeong.
-Thank you.

139
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,018
Hello?

140
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,106
Okay.

141
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,444
Okay.

142
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,574
Who called you?

143
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
My boyfriend.

144
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

145
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,095
Since when?

146
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,058
We just started going out.

147
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,353
I see.

148
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,282
Does he workâ€¦

149
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,204
at our branch?

150
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,959
Yes.

151
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,381
-Then is he--
-It's Jong-hyeon.

152
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,676
What?

153
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,802
Wellâ€¦

154
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,222
He's the security guard at our bank.

155
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,809
The handsome one?

156
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,691
You look good together. Congratulations.

157
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
I have something similar already.

158
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,541
But it's not
the exact same, so I'll take it.

159
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,587
Hey, Mi-seon!

160
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,713
Gosh, Seong-hye.

161
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,467
What's wrong?
Why are your nostrils flaring?

162
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,013
Follow me this instant.

163
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,015
-Right now.
-Hey!

164
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,979
Have you gone insane?

165
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,024
Why would you tell people about that?

166
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,484
Seong-hye, people are staring.

167
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,363
You told people about how
my husband throws a fit while eating

168
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,326
and that I got a herniated disc
from ducking under the dinner table.

169
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,120
What do you take me for?

170
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,081
Look, I only told Jin-suk.

171
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,792
Why her, of all people?

172
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,962
You know how much of a big mouth she has!

173
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,884
I just meant that
your husband's aesthetic sense is so great

174
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,470
that he can create art
just by throwing a spoon.

175
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,555
That's what I meant.

176
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,890
Don't you dare lie to me.

177
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,102
I know that you're actually jealous of me.

178
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,145
I really do.

179
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,272
Why are you so jealous?

180
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,110
Is it because I have a limited edition
that you don't have?

181
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,654
Me? Jealous of you?

182
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,822
What are you talking about?

183
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,784
I'm not a materialistic person.

184
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,745
Then why did you do that?

185
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,914
You blabbermouth.

186
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,290
-Why did you do that?
-Hey.

187
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,583
You've gone insane.

188
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,794
-What are you doing?
-Gosh!

189
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
Let her go.

190
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,965
Who are you?

191
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,800
Step aside.

192
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,802
How about I step aside and call the cops?

193
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,096
What?

194
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,598
Be polite when talking to a stranger.

195
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,101
She's right. You were being rude.

196
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,396
Who are you to butt inâ€¦

197
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,024
-Ma'am?
-Me?

198
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm her friend.

199
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,827
Ms. Han, you were so impressive.

200
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,329
I totally fell in love with you.

201
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,709
Why did you do it?
Were you really jealous of her bag?

202
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,295
Gosh, she said that her husband
had bought that handbag for her.

203
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,882
She was bragging
about how well he treated her.

204
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,221
It annoyed me,
so I just told one person about it.

205
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,435
You see, my husband
doesn't talk much at all.

206
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,438
Your husband isn't like that, right?

207
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,733
My husband died a long time ago.

208
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,942
Goodness.

209
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,490
I'm sorry. That was so thoughtless of me.

210
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,078
It doesn't hurt to talk about him anymore
because I've been too busy with life.

211
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey. How about we actually become friends?

212
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,716
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

213
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,722
Hey.

214
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,516
This is a gift for your son.

215
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,686
-Ma'am, I can't--
-Come on.

216
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,190
We agreed to be friends.
I'll see you at the spa later. Bye.

217
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,949
-I'm heading out. Bye.
-Goodbye.

218
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,368
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

219
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,537
-See you.
-Okay.

220
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,497
-Bye.
-Bye.

221
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,291
-Goodbye.
-See you.

222
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,627
Hey.

223
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,338
What took you so long to get back?

224
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,424
Aren't you going home?

225
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,927
I have to lock up before I go.

226
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,350
Where were you?

227
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,897
Where did you go after
lying about going to a site inspection?

228
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,650
Just lock up, okay?

229
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,027
Fine.

230
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,780
Bye.

231
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,465
You're still here.

232
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,177
I need to organize these before I go.

233
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,227
I have some documents
that I need for tomorrow.

234
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,731
I see. Okay, then.

235
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,442
Okay.

236
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,966
Gosh, my neck is killing me,

237
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,136
and the gloomy mood at work
is stressing me out.

238
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,556
Do you want to have a drink
at that 30-year-old whelk restaurant?

239
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,893
They're really small,
but they taste like abalone.

240
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,894
Sure.

241
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,354
I don't have a family
waiting for me at home,

242
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,565
-so I might as well have some whelk.
-Right.

243
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,526
Someone left the door open.
Why do they do that?

244
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,653
Unbelievable.

245
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,326
Mr. Ma, thank you.

246
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,077
Care to have some whelk nearby?

247
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,913
I was craving a drink today.

248
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,123
-Let me just turn off the lights.
-Okay.

249
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,766
What are you looking for?

250
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,645
I changed the order of some documents.

251
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,979
What are you looking for?

252
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,106
A copy of the loan agreement

253
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,859
and the collateral security agreement.

254
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,654
They're probablyâ€¦

255
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,504
Security system activated.

256
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,441
Mr. So must've
turned off the lights without checking.

257
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,526
Right.

258
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,656
Do you have your phone on you?

259
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,784
I left it in the locker room.

260
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,370
Mine is in the lounge.

261
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,253
The security company will be notified
once they detect our movement,

262
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,796
so let's wait.

263
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,339
Okay.

264
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,808
Let me see
if there's a light switch somewhere.

265
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,145
I'll look too.

266
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,033
Your handâ€¦

267
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,703
I'm sorry.

268
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,081
You can go first.

269
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,894
LOCKED

270
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,822
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,825
For what?

272
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,040
For talking as if your issue
with Mr. Yuk wasn't a big deal.

273
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,504
I know you didn't mean it.

274
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,675
I understand
that you could've thought of it that way.

275
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,518
I'm sorry too.

276
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,314
For what?

277
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,859
Forâ€¦

278
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,491
being overly upset with you
just because you didn't show up.

279
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,790
Don't be. You had every reason to be mad.

280
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,088
I'd also like to apologize
for what happened that day.

281
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,591
I should haveâ€¦

282
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,221
kept my promise.

283
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,943
You asked me at the training instituteâ€¦

284
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,242
if things would've been different
for us had you shown up that day.

285
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,705
If I had kept my promiseâ€¦

286
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,168
would you have dated me?

287
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,213
No.

288
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,220
It wouldn't have worked out for us.

289
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,848
Because we're too different.

290
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,727
How are we so different?

291
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,273
-I don't get it.
-I think you do.

292
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,318
That's why you hesitated.

293
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,903
I told you that wasn't it.

294
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,362
It meant the same thing.

295
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
Mr. Ha.

296
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:06,004
You should meet a woman
who can fulfill your desires.

297
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,481
Was thisâ€¦

298
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,278
the answer you were going to give me?

299
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,117
Yes.

300
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,831
Then what about you?

301
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,754
Did you meet someone
who could fulfill your desires?

302
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,140
I did.

303
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:19,369
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you guys were in here.

304
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,829
The security company called,

305
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,664
so I rushed over
from the whelk restaurant.

306
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,251
I should get going now.

307
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,712
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,136
What happened between you two?

309
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,887
What's with the long face?

310
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,389
Nothing happened. Move.

311
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,027
JEONG JONG-HYEON

312
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,528
Text me when you get home.

313
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,839
YOUNGPO CENTRAL TRADITIONAL MARKET

314
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,370
The bus will arrive soon.

315
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,375
I should go now. My bus is here.

316
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,169
Okay.

317
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,050
Ms. Ahn.

318
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,848
Get home safely.

319
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,145
I will.

320
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,864
I'm a bit late, aren't I?
Sorry, something came up.

321
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,866
Let's go inside.

322
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,626
Isn't it tasty?

323
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
It is.

324
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,715
Do you come here often?

325
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,261
No, I've only been here once,
when I first came to Seoul.

326
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:28,224
It felt awkward to eat alone,
so I kept looking out the window.

327
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,647
Have you been there before?

328
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,568
I haven't.

329
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,323
People who live in Seoul rarely go there.

330
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,577
But those who aren't from here
always want to visit the N Seoul Tower.

331
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,997
Are you teasing me
for being a country kid?

332
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,417
I was a country kid myself,

333
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,837
so I used to feel the same way.

334
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,425
I went there not long
after moving to Seoul.

335
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,680
It didn't seem that high
once I got to the top.

336
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,767
I was a little disappointed.

337
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,022
I've always wanted
to go there with my girlfriend.

338
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,400
Okay. Let's go next time.

339
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,860
Okay.

340
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,661
I know you're going through
a lot these days.

341
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,708
I'm sorry I can't be of much help.

342
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:43,424
I tried my best not to have false hope.

343
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,681
I always told myself
that it was okay to be alone.

344
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,979
But I feel reassured now that I have you.

345
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,695
I'm sorry that I reported him
without telling you in advance.

346
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,074
What will happen now?

347
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,829
I might get sent
to a different branch instead of him.

348
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,207
That's the most likely scenario.

349
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,377
Then why did you do it?

350
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,300
I wanted to make the decision.

351
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,017
Instead of getting caught up
in what might happen,

352
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,813
I wanted to decide on my own
and take responsibility for it.

353
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,154
I'm okay.

354
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,407
It's about time I moved

355
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,993
and being
in a new environment will motivate me.

356
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,334
Let's go on a date this weekend.

357
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,337
Isn't your exam next week?

358
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,757
People who cram
are those who don't have a study routine.

359
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,302
Sounds like you're confident.

360
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:15,099
My mock test score was way over
the minimum qualifying score.

361
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,227
I've been studying for a while now.

362
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,774
It's getting late, though.
You should go home and study.

363
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,782
By the way, it must hurt a lot to walk.

364
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,869
Those heels look very uncomfortable.

365
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,874
Don't your feet hurt? I bet they do.

366
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,805
A pick-me-up gift.

367
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,228
You didn't have to get me anything.

368
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,980
Do you like them?

369
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,192
I'll take care when I wear them.

370
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,528
No, you should wear them
whenever you want.

371
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:14,325
And when you're having a rough day,
you can call me whenever you want.

372
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,078
I will.

373
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,089
A group loan for Blue Hill Apartment
will take place soon.

374
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,635
So I'd like all of you
to wrap up your current work before then.

375
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,513
A mobile branch
will be provided if necessary,

376
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,098
so keep that in mind.

377
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,307
Andâ€¦

378
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,236
Ms. Ahn.

379
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,407
Yes?

380
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,411
Wellâ€¦

381
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,915
Thank you for organizing the filing room.

382
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,509
-Thank you.
-Alsoâ€¦

383
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,887
Iâ€¦

384
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,558
I didn't mean to offend you, but if I did,

385
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,314
I regret my actions.

386
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:32,320
It's my job to take care of our employees,
but I failed to be considerate of you.

387
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,829
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,209
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

389
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,799
Now then, let's get ready to work.

390
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,636
No way. What was that?

391
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:01,516
I believe Mr. Yuk
gave her a formal apology.

392
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,685
What's going on? What did you guys say?

393
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,147
Have you finally realized
that you have me to thank for this?

394
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,484
Don't be absurd. It was all thanks to me.

395
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,113
This is what I said in this seat
during that interview.

396
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,449
Ms. Ahn is definitely the sensitive type.

397
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,912
However, she would
never lie about something.

398
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,164
Mr. Yuk is a wonderful man.

399
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,794
However, he does
take advantage of his authority at times.

400
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,588
Coercion and making her
do unreasonable tasksâ€¦

401
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,507
I witnessed it too.

402
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,510
I wouldn't have put up with it either.

403
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,513
Anonymity is guaranteed, right?

404
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,268
You don't have to thank me.
There's no need for any of that.

405
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,978
Hold on.

406
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,858
Does that mean
Mr. Yuk will be disciplined or something?

407
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,195
It looks like he won't be
going on power trips anymore

408
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,074
since he's become a bit vulnerable now.

409
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,246
Since things turned out well,
doesn't this call for a round of coffee?

410
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,956
I'll treat everyone to coffee then.

411
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,959
I'd like an iced coffee, please.

412
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,419
Okay.

413
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,758
Ha Sang-su.

414
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,135
It was you.

415
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,600
A bank would never reprimand
a superior for something like coercion.

416
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,935
Unless a General Affairs employee

417
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,771
reported him for embezzling
operating expenses.

418
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,483
How did you know?

419
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,819
How could I not know?

420
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,992
I'm calling about Mr. Park
and what happened last Fridayâ€¦

421
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,372
He was off duty?

422
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:57,173
You looked into his expenditures
and found records of personal use.

423
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,426
Then you went to HQ to report him.

424
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,016
But why haven't you told anyone about it?

425
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,687
Nobody needs to know.

426
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:17,026
Why not?
Ms. Ahn would thank you if she found out.

427
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,694
What difference would that make?

428
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,282
Be honest with me.

429
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,620
Would you have done the same
had I been in her shoes?

430
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,414
You reported your superior.

431
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,459
It could work against you
when you go to HQ.

432
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,379
Would you still have done it
if it were me?

433
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,006
Are you crazy? I'd just let you get fired.

434
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,549
You jerk.

435
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,011
You still like her, right?

436
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,972
Stop it already.

437
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,516
You're the one who should stop.

438
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,811
Has Seok-hyeon taught you nothing?

439
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,188
He was head-over-heels in love
for years with his ex,

440
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,608
but in the end,
he's marrying someone on his level.

441
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,572
What? Am I being a snob?

442
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,743
What's the big deal about love anyway?

443
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,120
Is it really that great?

444
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,331
People are so weird.

445
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,879
They read reviews and do thorough research
before purchasing an item.

446
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,966
But they act all innocent
when it comes to love

447
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,094
and pretend like they don't judge others.

448
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,556
Then they call you a bastard
if you weigh your options.

449
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,688
Want one?

450
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,650
Do you not see that?

451
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,778
NO SMOKING

452
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,780
There's no place to smoke these days.

453
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,422
Mr. So.

454
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,758
Yes?

455
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,601
Did Mr. Yuk tell you
to wash his car again?

456
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,561
Yes.

457
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,732
You're a security guard,
not a car wash employee.

458
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,109
Let me carry that.

459
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,570
I bought one for you too. Take it.

460
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,947
Thanks.

461
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,618
I heard everything worked out well.

462
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,745
Yes, thanks to everyone.

463
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm glad.

464
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,250
Hold on.

465
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,724
You didn't know, did you?
Don't let on that you know.

466
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,144
Did you know about this?

467
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,563
Su-yeong and I have become close.

468
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
They just started dating.

469
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,655
All done.

470
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,407
-Done?
-Yes.

471
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,744
Don't Su-yeong and Jong-hyeok
look good together?

472
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,747
His name is Jong-hyeon.

473
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,749
Not Jong-hyeok.

474
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,836
Jong-hyeon.

475
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,761
He must really like her.

476
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,722
I'm so jealous that they're dating.

477
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,063
Goodbye.

478
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,248
It wouldn't have worked out for us.

479
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,959
Mr. Ha.

480
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,048
You should meet a woman
who can fulfill your desires.

481
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,189
WHAT MAKES TONGYEONG OYSTERS SPECIAL

482
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,653
Excuse me, but are you from Tongyeong?

483
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,781
-Yes, I am.
-I see.

484
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,078
What kind of place is Tongyeong?

485
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,757
Someone I know used to live there.

486
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,469
I'm just curious.

487
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,516
I wonder what kind of place it is.

488
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,854
The ocean is beautiful there.

489
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,273
It's very blue.

490
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,442
You should visit when you have the chance.

491
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,322
I'm not sure.

492
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,409
Will I ever get the chance?

493
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,290
Has work been hard these days?

494
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,626
You're drinking a lot.

495
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,504
Of course, it's been hard.

496
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,381
It's tough workâ€¦

497
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,510
but that's not why it's been hard.

498
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,475
You should finish up and go home.

499
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,851
You drank a lot already.

500
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,813
Okay.

501
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,529
I should finish things up.

502
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,188
Here.

503
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,967
I still have the side dishes
from your last visit.

504
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,844
I threw them away.

505
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,387
Eat the new dishes I brought.

506
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,517
I made this for you.

507
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,981
You'd be a terrible daughter
if you ate everything, but this.

508
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,858
You're in a good mood today.

509
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,652
Really?

510
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,447
I made a new friend.

511
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,491
Who?

512
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,410
Nobody you know. She's so amazing.

513
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,080
She's like a guardian angel.

514
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,708
Now you can finally stop stalking Dad.

515
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,877
He went to work again today.

516
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,422
I heard he's meeting people
from your branch.

517
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,301
HQ has allowed you

518
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,304
to get the maximum limit
when purchasing the land.

519
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:46,308
We will also offer you
the best interest rate possible.

520
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,520
All right. Let's take a look at it.

521
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,854
Thank you.

522
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,649
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,861
Are you married?

524
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,031
-Not yet, sir.
-What a shame.

525
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:06,745
A true man
needs to have a family he can support.

526
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,498
Do you have a girlfriend?

527
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,084
No, sir.

528
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,841
Let's play a proper round of golf
next time around.

529
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,592
I'd like that, sir.

530
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,727
Sang-su.

531
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,605
What brings you here?

532
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,274
I met with a client. You?

533
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,778
I see. Are you here for your father?

534
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,698
No, I came to hang out with you.

535
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,962
Are you thirsty?

536
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,548
Do you want something to drink?

537
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,016
I made it this morning.

538
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,393
What an early bird.

539
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,233
What is this? It tastes great.

540
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,245
Is there something on my face?

541
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,081
No, you're just ugly.

542
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,167
Which part is ugly?

543
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,839
Your eyes and nose.

544
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,772
Stop staring and study.
I know I'm handsome.

545
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,988
That's for you.

546
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:18,126
They say
it's impossible to understand love.

547
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,965
Howeverâ€¦

548
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,092
LE DERNIER MODÃˆLE

549
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,844
â€¦ I find it even more impossible
to understand myself.

550
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,139
I can't understand
why I hesitated back then

551
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,768
or why I need to let go now.

552
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,812
Giacometti?

553
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:43,485
He was an incredible man.
And an incredible artist and lover.

554
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,241
They say he was in love with three women.

555
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,955
There was his muse, Isabel,
whom he stayed with for only three months.

556
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,083
Caroline was a prostitute
and his last lover.

557
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,042
And finally,

558
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,671
his devoted wife, Annette,
who was by his side until the end.

559
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,676
Which one of them
do you think he loved the most?

560
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,682
He should have loved his wife the most.

561
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,642
Right?

562
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:20,480
But he poured all his passion and love
into another woman.

563
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,108
And for that, people still badmouth him.

564
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,696
You can't control your heart's desire.

565
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,450
What's this? Why are you defending him?

566
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,581
You shouldn't go down the same path.

567
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,376
After all,
you're a bank clerk, not an artist.

568
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,564
I think HQ will make
the announcement soon.

569
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,108
Really?

570
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,027
Are you going to apply?

571
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,744
What's wrong?

572
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,166
It won't start.

573
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,137
Is this funny?

574
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,807
-Of course, it is.
-Is this entertaining for you?

575
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,059
It sure is.

576
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,811
Unbelievable.

577
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,646
I seem carefree, don't I?

578
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,857
Aren't you happy when I'm around?

579
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,531
It's nice to see you smile.

580
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,242
You should've just taken a taxi.

581
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,369
And miss out on all this fun?

582
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,622
I've always wanted to ride in a tow truck.

583
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,127
You're going to think of me
whenever you see a tow truck from now on.

584
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,046
Did you just lay a curse on me?

585
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,798
Yes.

586
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,969
Think of me, Sang-su. Abracadabra!

587
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,850
I'm sorry, sir.

588
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,658
TRAFFIC POLICE

589
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,995
Will you be doing that too?

590
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,747
Yes, if I pass the exam.

591
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,000
You'll look so amazing.

592
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,920
You'll be the first person
I salute when I become an officer.

593
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,256
Promise?

594
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,091
Yes. I'll keep it at all costs.

595
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,934
You had to spend your day
in the library because of me.

596
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,060
I'm sorry.

597
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,104
That's fine.

598
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,941
I'll treat you to some good food
after the exam to make up for it.

599
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,873
What are you doing?

600
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:29,336
Didn't you learn
how to hold hands with your friends?

601
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,005
I made sure I learned that lesson.

602
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,216
We're not friends.

603
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,802
We're closer than that.

604
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:42,599
But we're still using honorifics.
This is quite a difficult relationship.

605
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,019
I agree. It is.

606
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,273
People who talk casually to you
at work only do that

607
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,776
because they look down on you.

608
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,572
But you're someone I always want
to treat with good manners.

609
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,743
So you're right.
This is a difficult relationship for me.

610
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:14,256
Would you like to come over
on the morning of your exam?

611
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,388
You should take the exam
on a full stomach to do well.

612
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,767
And that way, you'll treat me
to some good food later.

613
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,270
I'll make you breakfast.

614
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,282
-Please insert your card.
-Okay.

615
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,036
Actually, I don't need the cigarettes.

616
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,663
Sure.

617
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,849
You're going to think of me
whenever you see a tow truck from now on.

618
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,020
Think of me, Sang-su. Abracadabra!

619
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,750
Hi, come on in.

620
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,256
These are for you.

621
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,842
You didn't have to.

622
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,429
I was told to buy flowers when going
to my girlfriend's for the first time.

623
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,515
-Who told you that?
-The Internet.

624
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,020
Thank you. Come in.

625
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,027
This is amazing.

626
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,030
Really?

627
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,115
Sorry for looking around without asking.

628
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,118
That's exactly why I cleaned the house.

629
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,996
This is a beautiful area.

630
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,625
It's my favorite place in the house.

631
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,044
I only chose this place
because of the veranda.

632
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,380
Did you grow all this yourself?

633
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,424
Yes. It was my dream.

634
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,303
I pick and eat the herbs
whenever I have pasta or tea.

635
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,431
Do you play the piano too?

636
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,725
I taught myself. I'm not very good.

637
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,436
Can you play for me right now?

638
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,818
It's too early for that. Maybe next time.
Hurry up. The food's ready.

639
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,571
Eat up.

640
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,449
Thank you for the meal.

641
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,331
This is delicious.

642
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,253
You've always been there for me
when I needed support.

643
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,173
This is an important exam,
so I wanted to do something for you too.

644
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,218
Take your time, and eat slowly.

645
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,475
EXAMINATION SITE FOR POLICE WRITTEN TEST

646
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,916
How was the exam?
Call me when you're done.

647
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,518
Hello?

648
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,998
Goodness, hello.
You don't have an appointment.

649
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,125
I know.

650
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,753
We're friends, remember?
I'm just visiting.

651
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,131
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

652
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,427
I got some brunch for you
at a cafÃ© in Hannam-dong.

653
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:33,264
Thank you, but I'll have it later.
A client will be here soon.

654
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,184
There she is. Just a minute.

655
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,813
Hello. Please sit here.

656
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,523
Oh, dear.

657
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,109
This will get soggy later.

658
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,403
Ms. Han.

659
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,073
Go ahead and eat. I'll talk to her.

660
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,117
Sorry?

661
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,827
What is it?

662
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,997
I've been going to spas
for decades. I know what to do.

663
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,290
But--

664
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
What service are you interested in?

665
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,088
Aqua care? Pore tightening?
Or back acne treatment?

666
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:06,923
They're good at everything.

667
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,175
And you get a discount
if you purchase ten sessions.

668
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,052
Right, Ms. Han?

669
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,306
Yes. That's right.

670
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,775
You're still up.

671
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,362
Mom, can you please ring the doorbell?

672
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,281
That's a waste of electricity.

673
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,700
I'm leaving right away. Here.

674
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,742
What is this?

675
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,287
This is from me,
and this is from my friend.

676
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,000
Isn't this gift too expensive, though?

677
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,252
I agree. Well, see you.

678
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,921
-Already?
-I came to give you that.

679
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,715
I'm tired. Rest up.

680
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,634
And change the calendar. That's so old.

681
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,471
-Bye.
-Bye.

682
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,561
KCU BANK

683
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,192
Take two, then.
And become twice as average.

684
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,970
How was the exam?

685
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,347
I can't seem to reach you.

686
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,183
Are you not home yet?

687
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,777
Hello.

688
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,403
-Hey, you're the substitute.
-Yes.

689
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,696
-Thanks for helping out.
-Sure.

690
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,989
Good morning.

691
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,741
Good morning!

692
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,493
-Good morning.
-Morning.

693
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,872
Mr. Noh is on cloud nine these days.

694
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,542
That's because Mr. Yuk is miserable.

695
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,252
Action and reaction.

696
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,379
-It's science.
-That's right.

697
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,756
By the way, where's Mr. Jeong?

698
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,134
-I'm not sure.
-He's not here today?

699
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,639
JEONG JONG-HYEON
ARE YOU NOT HOME YET?

700
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:33,278
This number is not available right now.
At the tone, please record your message.

701
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,408
I can't seem to reach you, Jong-hyeon.

702
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,161
Is something wrong?

703
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,754
Your message has not been saved.

704
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,303
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

705
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,518
You have a guest.
She says you're expecting her.

706
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,686
-A guest?
-Yes, sir.

707
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,396
Who is it?

708
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,822
Hello.

709
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,912
Have you gone insane?

710
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,373
I'm already a laughingstock,
thanks to a stupid employee.

711
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,626
You just made it worse by coming here.

712
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,421
I told you to wait six months
until I became a director and--

713
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,052
What a beautifully
despicable couple you two are.

714
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,805
Aren't you supposed
to get a divorce first before remarrying?

715
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,726
What kind of nonsense is this?

716
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,900
Please pull down
the shutters at four o'clock

717
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,486
so that our customers will know
that we're closed.

718
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,239
-Hello.
-One iced Americano.

719
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,159
He's with a guest, ma'am.

720
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,995
Honey.

721
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,083
Goodness, I didn't know
you were with a guest.

722
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,461
My late mother-in-law

723
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,798
must've had a daughter
I didn't know about.

724
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,013
Close the door. Shut the door and come in.

725
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,810
What is this? Who is this woman?

726
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,730
Answer me!

727
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,193
I amâ€¦

728
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,988
his lawful wife.

729
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,504
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

730
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,548
-Why?
-It's The World of the Married.

731
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,299
-What?
-It's the real-life version.

732
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,093
-What do you mean?
-I'm so shocked.

733
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,095
My hands are shaking from the shock.

734
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,888
Hold on.

735
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,725
So the woman who we thought was his wife

736
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,810
-was actually--
-His mistress.

737
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,773
-And the woman who came in earlier is--
-His real wife.

738
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,406
It must've been
the mistress in the photo then.

739
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,074
They look the same from behind.

740
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,584
Is that where he spent
the operation expenses?

741
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,597
Goodness.

742
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,482
I'm taking a leave of absence.

743
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,739
Goodbye, sir.

744
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,163
Gosh.

745
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,124
What's with Mr. Yuk these days?

746
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,256
Ms. Ahn, you missed out on a spectacle.

747
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,216
Pardon?

748
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,135
We saw the real-life version

749
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,765
-of The World of the Married.
-Mr. Ma. That's enough.

750
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,309
All right, let's wrap up.

751
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,814
By the way, where's Mr. Jeong?

752
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,148
Will he return tomorrow?

753
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,817
He also took a leave of absence.

754
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,319
Let's wrap things up now.

755
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,822
Oh, dear.

756
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,365
JEONG JONG-HYEON

757
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,991
Did you take a leave of absence?

758
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,536
Is everything okay?

759
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,663
I'm worried.

760
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,334
JEONG JONG-HYEON

761
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,713
Jong-hyeon, what's going on?

762
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,423
Where are you?

763
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,557
Isn't it too late to work out?

764
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,517
Have you never jogged at night?

765
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,893
It feels amazing.

766
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,980
-Do the shoes fit?
-Yes, they do.

767
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,232
But how did you know my size?

768
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,775
I didn't.

769
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,652
I got every shoe size in my trunk.

770
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,363
What? That's going overboard.

771
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,074
I'm just joking.

772
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,785
-You said your feet were average-sized.
-Right.

773
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,371
Let's run to Dongjak Bridge.

774
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,665
Isn't that too far?

775
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,543
Tell me if you get tired, Mr. Ha.

776
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,211
I'll carry you on my back.

777
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,632
-You're being cheeky again.
-Let's go.

778
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,857
Are you sure you're okay?

779
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,234
Can't you see that
I'm slowing my pace for you?

780
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,946
Fine. You're a good runner.

781
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,781
Doesn't this feel great?

782
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,743
Yes, it does.

783
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:15,828
I feel the same.

784
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,916
This feels great!

785
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,609
Jong-hyeon.

786
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,697
Hi, Su-yeong.

787
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,910
What's going on?

788
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,040
I guess I was on edge
while preparing for the exam.

789
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,960
Now that it's over, I don't feel good.

790
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:06,963
I see.

791
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,885
I was worried sick.

792
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,056
I'm sorry.

793
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,395
Do you feel better now?

794
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,231
Yes.

795
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,652
That's a relief.

796
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,210
Your heart
is going to explode at this rate.

797
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,587
Worry about your own heart, Sang-su.

798
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,756
My heart is younger than yours.

799
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,136
You're going to trip and fall.

800
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,347
My hobby is running marathons.

801
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,683
You're not so bad yourself, though.

802
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,144
Right.

803
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,396
This feels amazing.

804
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,733
Hey, are you okay?

805
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,067
Let me see.

806
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:16,490
Hey, you're bleeding!
I told you to slow down.

807
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,703
You should take better care of your body.

808
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,294
Hey, what's wrong? Are you crying?

809
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,587
Sang-su, look.

810
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,840
A 500-won coin.

811
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,595
I can't believe
you're happy about finding 500 won

812
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,305
when your knee is bleeding.

813
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,515
It's from 1998!

814
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,560
They only made
8,000 of these during the IMF.

815
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,187
This is crazy.

816
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:51,567
I can't believe I found this here.
No way. I can't believe this!

817
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,570
This is unbelievable!

818
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,155
Right.

819
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:57,948
You really are unbelievable.

820
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,618
Did you hear me? It's from 1998!

821
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,636
Look at this, Jong-hyeon.

822
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,935
I wore these today.

823
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,564
I see. They look good on you.

824
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,908
Su-yeong.

825
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,285
Yes?

826
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,080
I have something to tell you.

827
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:57,383
This is so surreal.
Hey, should I buy a lottery ticket?

828
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:03,973
How can you be so happy
with a scraped knee?

829
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,977
So what? Accidents happen.

830
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:13,190
It felt great to run.
And I ended up finding this.

831
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,193
I'm showing this off at work tomorrow.

832
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,411
What is it? Do you want it?

833
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,043
You can't have it for free, though.

834
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,630
I'll give it to you if you date me.

835
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,491
Shall we then?

836
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,329
Give it to me.

837
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,253
Sang-su.

838
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:19,798
Whatâ€¦

839
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,176
What did you say?

840
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,391
Let'sâ€¦

841
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,692
Like you said,

842
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,196
I'm not 100% ready yet.

843
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,533
Are you okay with that?

844
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,835
I just need 1%.

845
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,130
I can fill up the rest.

846
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:11,225
I'm confident
that this relationship will work.

847
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:43,841
So this means we're in a relationship now.

848
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:52,599
All right.

849
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,936
Let's break up.

850
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,773
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

851
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:02,753
I'm looking at my boyfriend,
wondering why he said he'd date me.

852
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:08,759
Were you really single that whole time?
Not even a crush?

853
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,721
Looks like you two have become close.

854
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,764
Is that a problem?

855
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,935
So does Mi-gyeong know?
That you liked Ms. Ahn.

856
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,897
So why are you
stabbing me in the back like this?

857
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,692
I'm dating Sang-su.
I thought you should know.

858
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,277
Mi-gyeong.

859
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,862
If I fall down,

860
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,614
will you ask me out again?

861
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:33,325
Is that what you really want?
Is it that easy for you?

862
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:40,541
