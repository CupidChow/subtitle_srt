THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,503
What's on your mind?

3
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,050
EPISODE 12

4
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,678
Why call if you don't want to talk?

5
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,596
Those two…

6
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,307
They're dating, right?

7
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,896
Sang-su and Su-yeong.

8
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650
Did you know?

9
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,364
I know everything you know, Gyeong-pil.

10
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,366
Hold on.

11
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,037
Then why haven't you
said anything this whole time?

12
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,294
You're not some naive 20-year-old.
Why would you be so foolish?

13
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,464
Is that being foolish?

14
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,138
Does giving your entire heart
to someone make you foolish?

15
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,433
I turned a blind eye to protect our love.

16
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,103
Was it foolish of me
to expect him to give up on her?

17
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,484
Then you shouldn't have
gotten hurt in the process.

18
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,488
I thought he'd be different.

19
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,325
Love…

20
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,244
makes you feel anxious.

21
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,121
Good luck.

22
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,541
I'm rooting for you.

23
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,501
I really am.

24
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,927
What about Su-yeong?

25
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,474
Sorry?

26
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,601
How is your relationship…

27
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,812
these days?

28
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,028
Love sways your heart.

29
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,824
It must be sad for you, though, Mr. Jeong.
Doesn't it feel empty without her?

30
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,332
Don't you feel empty, Sang-su?

31
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,584
And in the end…

32
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,593
you get caught because of love.

33
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,322
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

34
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,702
Stop the car. We need to talk.

35
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,997
We'll talk later.

36
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
Mi-gyeong.

37
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,710
I said we'll talk later.

38
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,217
-We have to do it today.
-Today is my birthday!

39
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,305
I have feelings for someone.

40
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,891
And it's not you.

41
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,575
I told you I wanted to talk later!

42
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,788
Do you really think that I don't know?

43
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:39,130
Do you think I have no idea
where your true feelings lie?

44
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,970
They're living together.

45
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,600
Su-yeong and Mr. Jeong
are living together!

46
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,035
Let's break up.

48
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,631
Who is she anyway?

49
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,469
What on earth does she mean to you?!

50
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,638
This isn't about her.

51
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,432
It's about how I feel.

52
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,728
This is only happening
because you have feelings for her.

53
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,021
Mi-gyeong.

54
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,565
It's not like that.

55
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,859
Then why do you want to break up?

56
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,781
Is it because you don't love me anymore?

57
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,869
Sang-su.

58
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,249
Don't act like…

59
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,461
you fell out of love with me.

60
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,966
You never loved me in the first place.

61
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,636
We didn't get together
because you loved me.

62
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,681
That part hasn't changed.

63
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,727
So that's not a valid reason to break up.

64
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,732
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,411
I'm so sorry.

66
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,669
You gave me your word.

67
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,255
You said you'd try.

68
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,884
So I need you to try again
from the beginning.

69
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:12,783
Do you really like me?

70
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,749
Why would you ask me that?

71
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,793
I'm just curious.

72
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,174
Are your feelings for me…

73
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,972
out of love…

74
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,769
Or compassion?

75
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,696
Do you think I don't feel any love

76
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,283
for you?

77
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,541
What about you?

78
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,215
Is love the only emotion…

79
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,052
you feel toward me?

80
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,254
Did you get home safely?

81
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,918
Hello?

82
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,130
Can you talk?

83
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,590
Yes.

84
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,344
Are you okay?

85
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,600
No. I'm not okay.

86
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,521
Where are you right now?

87
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,569
I'm home.

88
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,252
Is Ms. Park okay?

89
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,432
You're here
to tell me something, aren't you?

90
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,399
I just wanted to walk with you.

91
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,570
That's why I came.

92
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,951
It looks like you're in pain.

93
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,039
Yes, but that's okay.

94
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,071
You haven't left yet?

95
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,701
I'm waiting
for Mr. Yuk's approval on something.

96
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,121
Can I drink this?

97
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,295
I'm sorry for how we left last night.

98
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,924
Sang-su wanted to spend time with me
since it was my birthday.

99
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,595
We chatted until late last night,
so I'm a bit tired.

100
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,393
Let's set up another date
and have something tasty.

101
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,397
Please tell Mr. Jeong that I'm sorry.

102
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,407
Mr. Yang, are you out of your mind?

103
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,202
How could you taint
our reputation like this?

104
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,040
This branch
is just full of dating couples.

105
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,876
Men and women matters
are the root of all problems here.

106
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,632
So tell me.
Whom has Seok-hyeon decided to live with?

107
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,093
His ex?
Or the FSS vice president's daughter?

108
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,178
How would I know?

109
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,264
People are scary these days.

110
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,892
Now everyone knows Mr. Yang
and his ex's private information.

111
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,769
Where they went to school, their families…

112
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,399
See? This is how scary relationships are.

113
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,442
Just don't date anyone.

114
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,572
I'm more scared
of this month's credit card bill.

115
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,532
Stop gossiping, will you?

116
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,952
Mr. Yang is the talk of the town
at all the other branches.

117
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,038
We should support him
since he's one of us.

118
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,456
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

119
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,254
Wash my car!

120
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,406
Hey.

121
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,741
Hey, leave him alone.

122
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,495
Gosh, he's done for.

123
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,247
What do you mean?

124
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,043
Mr. Yang has been suspended.

125
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,965
HQ found out about the scandal.
He's been suspended for two months.

126
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,803
So this is the outcome.

127
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,182
Banks are too conservative.

128
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
One scandal here could ruin your career.

129
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,437
He would've been promoted

130
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,649
and received financial support
from his in-laws.

131
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,443
I don't get why he did that.

132
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,988
Me neither. He knew he'd regret it.

133
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,663
-Please fill that out.
-Okay.

134
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,797
Ms. Ahn.

135
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,175
Ms. Ahn?

136
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,511
Yes?

137
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm sorry. Could you fill this out?

138
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,822
Sang-su, what are you doing?
You should sit on that side.

139
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,284
Jeez. You're so dense.

140
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,456
Goodness.

141
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,499
Okay.

142
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,378
Seok-hyeon, what do you want?
Order anything you want. It's on me.

143
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:49,299
What's done is done.
You should stay strong.

144
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,177
I'm sorry.

145
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,888
I'm not trying
to criticize you or anything.

146
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,224
I'm just curious.

147
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:03,605
You're crazy, aren't you?
How could you do something like that?

148
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,484
If you liked her that much,
you should've just stayed with her.

149
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,487
Can you please shut up?

150
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,491
Just think about it.
You were set for life.

151
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,619
Did you like her that much?

152
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:23,876
What were you thinking?
Are you a fool for love? Is that it?

153
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,879
I didn't want to regret it.

154
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,467
I didn't want…

155
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,804
I didn't want to lose her.
That's why I did it.

156
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,016
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,783
Have you given it some thought?

158
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:05,167
You're the one who should think about it.
I already gave you my answer.

159
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,551
My dad seems to be waiting for your call.

160
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,429
When is a good time for you?

161
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,225
Mi-gyeong.

162
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:30,400
You know as well as I do.
It's over for us.

163
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,867
How can you say that
after seeing what happened to Mr. Yang?

164
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,246
What if you end up like him?

165
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,669
I don't care.

166
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,471
Then what about Su-yeong?

167
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,977
Are you okay with her getting hurt?

168
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,483
Didn't you see how people
bad-mouthed Mr. Yang's ex?

169
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,445
And she didn't even work at the bank.

170
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,367
Because she didn't have an affair
with a married man,

171
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,495
do you think she'll be okay?

172
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,793
If we break up and you start dating her,

173
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,671
you'll go through
what Mr. Yang went through.

174
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,090
Don't you want
to keep working at the bank?

175
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,556
You could lose…

176
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,852
a lot more than you might expect.

177
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,147
So think this through more carefully.

178
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,945
Then what about you?

179
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,657
Are you okay?

180
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,163
Are you really okay with dating me…

181
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,209
when you already know how I feel?

182
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,512
Anything is better
than breaking up with you.

183
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,404
We haven't seen each other in a while.

184
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,283
That's true.

185
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,580
I was so shocked that day
that I just left in a hurry.

186
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,374
Yes.

187
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,541
You seemed like it.

188
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,881
As you already know, our family is…

189
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,176
Compared to yours, we're…

190
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,887
We're…

191
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,265
You know.

192
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,645
So…

193
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,190
I came here today to ask

194
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,817
what you plan to do.

195
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,736
What do you mean?

196
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,242
Our adult children are dating.

197
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,537
As parents, we can't help
but consider their future.

198
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,792
They're still young.
We don't need to think that far ahead.

199
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,462
Goodness. Ms. Han.

200
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,257
Are you drawing a line?

201
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,092
No, not at all.

202
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,178
I think we're being hasty
when they haven't been dating for long.

203
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,806
They've been together for some time now.

204
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,599
I found out a long time ago.

205
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,685
I see.

206
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,771
Hold on.

207
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,983
Don't you approve of Mi-gyeong?

208
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,156
Goodness. This is unbelievable.

209
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,785
Aren't you against them getting married?

210
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,456
Yes, but it's a different story
when you're against it too.

211
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:17,669
When you think about it,
shouldn't I be the one who's against it?

212
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,051
What is it?

213
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,514
You have a pimple.

214
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,730
Oh, no.

215
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,400
I must've been really stressed.

216
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,527
It's so big.

217
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,654
KCU BANK

218
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,451
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

219
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,790
-Hey, Jong-hyeon.
-Hello.

220
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,416
-Hey.
-Come on. Hold on.

221
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,376
-Jong-hyeon has told us a lot about you.
-Stop.

222
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,170
If you're free, please stop by!

223
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,379
-Please come!
-Come!

224
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,714
-Su-yeong?
-Why did you do that?

225
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,382
I'm sorry, Su-yeong.

226
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,681
I'll come there. Where are you?

227
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,205
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

228
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,170
Once again, it's nice to meet you.

229
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,923
By the way, is today a special occasion?

230
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,175
It's our 50-day celebration.

231
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,681
Didn't you know?

232
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,391
We have 50 days until the exam.

233
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,062
So how long…

234
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,815
-have you two been going out?
-How did you meet?

235
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,901
-Stop asking her.
-Why?

236
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,779
We met at the bank.
We work at the same place.

237
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,656
No way.

238
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,616
-Unbelievable.
-Jong-hyeon has skills.

239
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,742
He has everything.

240
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,953
Well, I'm more envious of her.

241
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,625
She's pretty, works at a bank,
and also dates Jong-hyeon.

242
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,878
I'm so jealous.

243
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,338
-Hey, stop drinking.
-Why?

244
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,716
Thanks to you,
my mock exam scores have shot up,

245
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,758
so I'm in a great mood.

246
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,596
You were laughing at my jokes
up until a while ago.

247
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,602
Su-yeong, it's okay
to make him laugh, right?

248
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:42,856
Sorry?

249
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:47,194
He told me
that he was the most grateful to you.

250
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,863
But he said he had the most fun with me.

251
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,949
He laughs a lot when I'm around.

252
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,077
Hey, what's gotten into you?

253
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,623
-What?
-Su-yeong, I'm sorry.

254
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,969
I'm sorry about today.

255
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,180
What for?

256
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,185
I shouldn't have let you come.
You ended up paying for everything.

257
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,896
It's not a big deal.

258
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,961
PERMANENTLY CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

259
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,925
Do you live around here?

260
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,431
I live nearby too. Up there.

261
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,584
Su-yeong.

262
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,796
Do you want to go on a date tomorrow?

263
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,174
But your exam is around the corner.

264
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,968
Exactly.

265
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,722
Let's go on a date before I get too busy.

266
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,143
All right.

267
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,770
Let's do that.

268
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,592
Your palm is sweaty.

269
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,686
Let's go in.

270
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,772
Okay.

271
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,334
They're living together.

272
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,046
Su-yeong and Mr. Jeong
are living together!

273
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,151
What's this?

274
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,446
They're tarts. You can have them.

275
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,075
Did you get them for me?

276
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,453
They looked good, so I bought some.

277
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,585
Stop what you're doing and sit down.

278
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,475
Today, Mi-gyeong's mom came for a visit.

279
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,146
They seem to think
marriage is on the table.

280
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,731
Am I right?

281
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,238
I just want to know
what your thoughts are about this.

282
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,578
We're going to break up.

283
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,831
It's already over on my part.

284
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,589
But Mi-gyeong isn't ready yet,
so I'm giving her some time.

285
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,426
What kind of person is she?

286
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,429
What?

287
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,141
The person whom you truly like.

288
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,060
What kind of woman is she?

289
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,534
I don't know when it started,

290
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,996
but I'd run simulations in my head.

291
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:57,545
No matter what the issue is,
I'd always imagine the end result first.

292
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,717
I'd imagine the worst possible scenario

293
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,096
and worry about whether or not
I could handle it.

294
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,311
I only feel at ease
once I come up with a solution.

295
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,606
But with her…

296
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,318
that's not possible.

297
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,157
I feel anxious…

298
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,369
and uncomfortable…

299
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,872
about this situation…

300
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
and my feelings.

301
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,046
And yet…

302
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,427
none of that matters when I'm with her.

303
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,813
End of confession.

304
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,568
Can I get back to that?

305
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,168
Shall we?

306
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,629
Yes.

307
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,558
Excuse me.

308
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,238
Back up!

309
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,673
-You should eat too.
-I will.

310
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,804
Su-yeong--

311
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,099
-Why did you hit him?
-Oh, dear.

312
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,351
Stop that.

313
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,478
Hush. There are other customers here.

314
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,313
Apologize to your brother.

315
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,482
-Give me the phone.
-You were saying?

316
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,108
Never mind. Enjoy the food.

317
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,860
He apologized. Now be quiet.

318
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,321
-It's over.
-Be quiet. We're in public.

319
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,874
What is it?

320
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,754
I have something to give you.

321
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,609
Do you not like it?

322
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
No, I like it.

323
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,346
Does it not fit?

324
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,517
I think my finger is a little swollen.

325
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,895
I'll try it on again later.

326
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,565
Okay.

327
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,240
Thank you.

328
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,401
Hello?

329
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,946
Hello, ma'am.

330
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,867
Should I apologize
for calling you out on the weekend?

331
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,536
That's okay.

332
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,373
By the way, what did you want to tell me?

333
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,959
It's nothing serious.

334
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,754
First, let me check off
a few things from my bucket list.

335
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,632
I'd sometimes get jealous
of my friends who have sons.

336
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,592
They go on shopping dates, you see.

337
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,178
I see.

338
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,598
Goodness, Sang-su. Follow me.

339
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,943
-It's okay.
-Right?

340
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,361
Isn't it just perfect?

341
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,740
Your son is very handsome, ma'am.

342
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
Is he not your son?

343
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,496
Yes, he is.

344
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,624
Sang-su, go try this on.

345
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,961
Ma'am.

346
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,505
I have something to tell you.

347
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,341
What is it?

348
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,062
Hey, you're here.

349
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
We went shopping together.

350
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,287
Why didn't you invite me?

351
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,832
We stopped midway
because he had something to tell me.

352
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,711
You shouldn't call him when he's busy.

353
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,421
He should be with me instead.

354
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,464
I had something to say too.

355
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,050
What is it?

356
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,678
To be honest,

357
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,098
I liked you from the moment
I first laid my eyes on you.

358
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:31,147
So I've decided
to fully support your marriage.

359
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,032
Are you moved by what I said?

360
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,992
Did I startle you?

361
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,078
They say parents
always give in to their kids.

362
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,914
And I agree.

363
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,041
Mom.

364
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,252
I'm sorry.

365
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,632
For what?

366
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,967
Don't do it.

367
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:05,223
Don't cut him off. That's rude.

368
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm listening, Sang-su.

369
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,938
-I--
-Don't.

370
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,402
Mi-gyeong and I…

371
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,867
have decided to break up.

372
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,962
I'm sorry.

373
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,483
We need to talk.

374
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,202
How could you do this?

375
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,582
My mom liked you so much
that she wanted us to get married.

376
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,875
Did you have to…

377
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,879
let her know like this?

378
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,342
Pretending like everything was fine
would've been more dishonest.

379
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,138
I'm truly sorry.

380
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,099
I'm aware of how much I hurt you.

381
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,183
But…

382
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,604
I can't keep going like this.

383
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,522
Why…

384
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,902
Why can't you…

385
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,198
just love me?

386
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,455
Even though you want to break up,

387
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,250
and you're in love with someone else,
I still love you.

388
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,920
So why don't you love me back?

389
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,090
What did I do that was so wrong?

390
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,719
It's not your fault
that I feel this way, Mi-gyeong.

391
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,480
What about Su-yeong?
Is she going to break up too?

392
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:27,156
If you break up with me,
will she leave Mr. Jeong and come to you?

393
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,790
Sang-su, I…

394
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,168
I really tried my best.

395
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,923
I wanted to be a good person
because that was easier to do.

396
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,927
But I won't be like that anymore.

397
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,931
I'll do whatever it takes…

398
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,186
to get the love I deserve.

399
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,709
I won't be out long.

400
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,296
And I couldn't tell you earlier,

401
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,719
but I'm going
to look for a place again soon.

402
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,809
Maybe not as big as my old house,
but I could find a smaller place.

403
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,899
I'll also pay you back soon.

404
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,073
All right.

405
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,329
Su-yeong.

406
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,921
Can I ask you for a favor?

407
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,050
Move a bit more to the side.

408
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,097
To your left.

409
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,020
This is an important photo, though.
Going to a photo studio might be better.

410
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,396
This is fine.

411
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,193
I think I'll do better on the exam
if you take the photo.

412
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,707
I'm going to take it now.

413
00:41:54,762 --> 00:42:01,560
Do you really like me?

414
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,942
Do you love me?

415
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,281
I won't give up.

416
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,079
So can we start over?

417
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,882
I love you.

418
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,040
Good night.

419
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,834
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

420
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,138
KCU BANK

421
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,943
How's Seok-hyeon doing these days?

422
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,237
He's going on a trip.

423
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,364
More like going into exile if you ask me.

424
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,827
I don't have to worry
about you, Sang-su, do I?

425
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,954
Hey.

426
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,124
Don't follow Seok-hyeon's footsteps.

427
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,793
You might not suffer as much as he did,

428
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,172
but you'll be done for if you offend
anyone in Ms. Park's family.

429
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,385
What's with the long face?
Did you guys argue?

430
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,972
About the Yeongmin Group's loan deal,
have you read the documents?

431
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:06,018
Yes, I started.
I'll finish up before lunchtime.

432
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,581
NEW NOTIFICATION: KCU HQ ANNOUNCEMENT

433
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,087
KCU BANK ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR 4TH QUARTER POSITION TRANSFER

434
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,893
Are you busy?

435
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,359
I came to apologize.

436
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,153
Sorry?

437
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,492
I found out you were living
with Jong-hyeon…

438
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,498
when I visited your house the last time.

439
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,003
I told Sang-su about it.

440
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,180
You know why I did that, right?

441
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,852
But still, I'm sorry.

442
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,107
It was a personal matter.

443
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,027
But I used it to my advantage.

444
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,827
I tried to resent you.

445
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,039
And I did a bit.

446
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,000
That's okay.

447
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,674
You can resent and despise me.

448
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,014
That would make me feel better.

449
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,015
That's exactly why…

450
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,603
I don't want you to feel better.

451
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,608
I want you to feel bad,
knowing that I like you.

452
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:24,114
Let that be a reason
to think twice about him.

453
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,705
I want you to continue feeling guilty.

454
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,917
So…

455
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,296
I'm going to keep liking you.

456
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,853
When I was in college,
there was a girl whom I liked.

457
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,982
First love for both of us.

458
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,612
I knew she was from a wealthy family.

459
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,241
But one day, her cousin visited me.

460
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
That was when I found out
how incredibly rich they were.

461
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,709
Well, the rest of the story is obvious.

462
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,212
"You're not good enough for her."

463
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,631
He told me to break up.

464
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:13,849
But I didn't listen, and I think it was
the third time he visited me.

465
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,873
I've never told this to anyone before.

466
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,878
Then why did you tell me?

467
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,307
Because I'm so bored.

468
00:48:56,683 --> 00:49:00,145
Gosh, why don't we ever see
any students come to the bank?

469
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,521
Do I need to reach out to them?

470
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,899
Gosh, this is a problem.

471
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,292
AHN SU-YEONG

472
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,104
You haven't left yet.

473
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,606
No.

474
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,819
You didn't have to hang up.

475
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,451
Goodbye.

476
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,036
By the way…

477
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,915
whom were you calling?

478
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,634
I was wondering if it was Ms. Park
because she'll be out soon.

479
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,857
I'm going to see Su-yeong now.

480
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,234
Then what about Su-yeong?

481
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,863
Are you okay with her getting hurt?

482
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,993
Because she didn't have an affair
with a married man,

483
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,371
do you think she'll be okay?

484
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,833
Is Su-yeong going to break up too?

485
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:35,050
If you break up with me,
will she leave Mr. Jeong and come to you?

486
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,837
I'm near your house.
Can we meet for a minute?

487
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,509
Sang-su.

488
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,012
Can you go to the subbranch?

489
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,680
Sorry?

490
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,391
Ms. Ahn suddenly took the day off,

491
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,228
so I asked if anyone
would be willing to sub for her.

492
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,815
But then everyone
became busy all of a sudden.

493
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,651
Look how busy they are.

494
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,819
So how could I ask them…

495
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,572
What is it?

496
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,783
Are you suddenly busy too?
Should I go instead?

497
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,244
No, I'll go.

498
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,413
Okay. Thanks.

499
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,465
Please fill in the blanks I checked.

500
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,549
Okay.

501
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,763
Why are you here?

502
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,264
I'm subbing for her.

503
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,434
I have a question.

504
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:20,608
Do you really like me?

505
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,781
Do you love me?

506
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,824
I like you.

507
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,911
It wasn't a mistake,
and I don't regret it.

508
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,336
Don't follow Seok-hyeon's footsteps.

509
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,715
You'll be done for if you offend
anyone in Ms. Park's family.

510
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,469
Banks are too conservative.

511
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,055
One scandal here could ruin your career.

512
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,347
He would've been promoted

513
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,559
and received financial support from
his in-laws. I don't get why he did that.

514
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,937
Me neither. He knew he'd regret it.

515
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,773
That's exactly why…

516
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,233
I don't want you to feel better.

517
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,613
Think twice about him.

518
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,200
I want you to continue feeling guilty.

519
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,326
So…

520
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,537
I'm going to keep liking you.

521
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,082
It looks like you're in pain.

522
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,711
Yes, but that's okay.

523
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,788
"THE FAREWELL WALTZ"

524
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,864
It's me.

525
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,868
I know.

526
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,331
Where are you?

527
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,400
Where are you going?

528
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,651
Can you close up alone?

529
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,236
Have you thought this through?

530
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,159
No. I'm done thinking.
I decided that a while ago.

531
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,554
Did you take the day off?

532
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,932
JEONG JONG-HYEON

533
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,225
I miss you.

534
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,810
You know I love you, right?

535
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,570
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

536
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,184
You came to the right place.

537
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,565
Of course. You're here.

538
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,656
Do you want some steamed silkworms?

539
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,033
There's some over there.

540
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,539
It's okay. I'm full. I had a heavy lunch.

541
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,297
I was sick of the ocean
when I lived in Tongyeong.

542
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:00,430
But I always think of it
when I'm struggling.

543
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,562
Are you struggling?

544
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,953
You made a nice sand castle.

545
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,124
I made them a lot as a kid.

546
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,044
Sand is free, after all.

547
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,760
Do you know what I realized…

548
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,221
while making a sand castle?

549
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,437
That one day,
it will eventually get washed away.

550
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,944
Despite knowing all that…

551
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,200
I was always worried
after carefully building one.

552
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,247
"What if someone destroys it
once I return home?"

553
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,586
"What if it gets swept away by the waves?"

554
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,965
I was worried sick all night long.

555
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,472
So guess what I did?

556
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,518
What did you do?

557
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,233
I destroyed it myself.

558
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,700
That way, I wouldn't have to worry.

559
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,289
If I destroyed it myself…

560
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,381
You could be wrong.

561
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,969
The sand castle…

562
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,973
could remain there for a very long time.

563
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,091
You've changed, Mr. Ha.

564
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,572
Can you get me something hot to drink?

565
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,950
The wind is picking up. It's chilly.

566
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,546
Sure.

567
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,191
Mr. Ha.

568
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:47,824
Thank you.

569
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,038
I'll be quick.

570
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,412
Excuse me.

571
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,789
One minute, please.

572
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,461
Excuse me. I'd like to pay for these.

573
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,797
Sure. One minute, please.

574
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,969
I'm sorry, but could you hurry?

575
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,053
Okay.

576
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,516
Here.

577
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,560
That's 10,000 won. The change--

578
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,988
The phone you have dialed is turned off…

579
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,328
Thank you for the meal.

580
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,538
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

581
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,338
Hello.

582
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,474
Where's Mom? I heard she was discharged.

583
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,980
She's resting at home. Have you eaten yet?

584
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,234
I want to drink instead.

585
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,310
Why did you do it?

586
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,067
We may have been poor.

587
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,656
But we were still a happy family
before that incident.

588
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:23,080
Mom worked really hard
while you were away working.

589
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,209
She worked at a restaurant
and sold insurance as well.

590
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,338
She worked her fingers to the bone.

591
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,718
So why did you do that to her?

592
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,564
Did you like that woman that much?

593
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,112
You didn't care about hurting others

594
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,490
or being criticized by them.

595
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,327
Were you that much in love?

596
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,546
It can't be stopped.

597
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,596
Once you start loving someone,

598
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,182
you can't stop.

599
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:30,439
You know it's wrong,
but you just can't stop.

600
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,662
Then why did you come back?

601
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,330
Because of regret.

602
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,877
If it were possible to turn back time,

603
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,046
that choice wouldn't be made.

604
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,426
Nobody would make that choice
if they knew how much they'd suffer later.

605
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,237
You weren't of any help to me back then…

606
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,283
and you're still of no help.

607
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,411
Su-yeong, is something going on?

608
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,246
I'm leaving.

609
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,313
JEONG JONG-HYEON

610
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,316
SU-YEONG, WHY IS YOUR PHONE OFF?

611
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,734
OPEN IMAGE

612
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,488
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

613
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,992
Can we meet right now?

614
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,013
Hello.

615
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,600
Has Ms. Ahn come to work yet?

616
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,645
She just went into the locker room.

617
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,564
I see.

618
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,902
-Hey.
-Hello.

619
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,823
Long time no see, Mr. Kim.
The advertisement pamphlets just came in.

620
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,825
-Good. Thanks in advance.
-My pleasure.

621
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,370
By the way, where is Mr. Jeong?

622
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,163
I'm not sure. Maybe he's running late.

623
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:04,737
You're here.

624
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,621
Why did you leave
all of a sudden yesterday?

625
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,993
Is it true?

626
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,332
-Let's talk outside.
-Answer me!

627
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,918
-Jong-hyeon--
-I'm asking you a question!

628
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,342
Tell me.

629
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,264
You already know the answer.

630
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,835
What are you doing?

631
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,337
-Let me go!
-Mr. Jeong!

632
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,215
What? Is there something
between you and Su-yeong too?

633
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,218
Did you sleep with her too?

634
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:27,421
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

635
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,566
You scumbag. Why did you…

636
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,526
Did you have feelings for Gyeong-pil?

637
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,777
Is this funny to you?

638
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,030
-Watch your mouth.
-Sang-su got himself in trouble.

639
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,407
Sang-su and Su-yeong
can never be together now.

640
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,202
I'm just saying it's okay
to be happy about it.

641
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,536
Let me ask you one thing.

642
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,164
Did Sang-su mean anything to you?

643
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,584
Then why did you want to stay together?

644
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,085
You never loved me, did you?

645
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,046
Were you happy when you were with me?

646
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,173
Mi-gyeong.

647
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,342
I don't want you to hurt because of me.

648
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,385
I like Su-yeong.

649
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,473
What I'm afraid of the most…

650
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:21,517
is not seeing you, Su-yeong.

651
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,605
