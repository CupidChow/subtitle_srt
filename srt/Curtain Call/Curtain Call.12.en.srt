00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

3
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,300
EPISODE 12

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,000
Grandma.

5
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:54,867
There you are.

6
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,300
Oh, child…

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Grandma.

8
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,500
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

9
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:03,734
No, I…

10
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,166
I'm feeling fine.

11
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,333
How did you know I was here?

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,367
I'll take your word for it, then.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,100
I had the feeling you'd be here,
so I came looking.

14
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,633
Goodness.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,467
Are you slacking off
during your work hours?

16
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,433
Oh, Grandma.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,200
Hotels don't work our socks off.

18
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,266
They give us lunch breaks and all.

19
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,166
This is my lunch break.

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Are you allowed to be here?

21
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,734
Come on, Grandma.

22
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,967
Aren't you the queen of this hotel?

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,533
Nobody would dare say anything.

24
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:49,333
Grandma, I'm not slacking off.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,433
Consider this as time for your welfare

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,967
and stay right where you are.

27
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,600
Grandma, does this feel relaxing?

28
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,600
Indeed, it does feel relaxing.

29
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,734
Wow, Grandma. Your shoulders are so tight.

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,600
I had a fair taste of bitterness in life.
That's why.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,467
They have been left neglected for so long.

32
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,066
That's why.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,533
Grandma, I'll make them all go away.

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,533
One, two, three, four…

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,033
Three, four--

36
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,900
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Get it together, man.

37
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,233
Mr. Ri Moon-seong.

38
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:11,867
Yes?

39
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:17,834
There you are.

40
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,233
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

41
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,233
No, thank you.

42
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,633
I'm working right now,
so I prefer to stay standing.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,000
I have something to tell you. Sit down.

44
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,900
Just give me your laundry.

45
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,133
I don't have time to waste like you.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
Quit the accent, will you?

47
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,100
-What do you mean?
-Quit the accent.

48
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,900
You know what? Keep it going.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,967
This is fascinating, now that I know.

50
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,367
Your acting's good.

51
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,433
Keep going.

52
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,066
Comrade Ri Moon-seong.

53
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,567
How much did you practice
to pull that off?

54
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,567
Don't be nervous.

55
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,900
Just because I know the truth

56
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,400
doesn't mean
I'm going to do anything to you.

57
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,433
It's not like I'm family.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
I don't want to meddle,
only to worsen the problem.

59
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,467
Sit.

60
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,200
I said, sit.

61
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,367
Well, what is it?

62
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,900
It's odd to hear your Seoul accent too.

63
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,867
Keep it brief.

64
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:58,867
All right.

65
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,100
I wanted to thank you.

66
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,567
I don't follow.

67
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,633
I'm going to marry Se-yeon, thanks to you.

68
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,667
You were such an eyesore in the beginning.

69
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,900
But look at us now.

70
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,767
Life is unpredictable, right?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Anyway, thank you.

72
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,333
No need to thank me--

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,967
No, I mean it.

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,233
I'm holding back
because I'm thankful to you.

75
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,033
And one more thing.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,300
That play of yours--

77
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,934
I don't know when it'll end.

78
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,800
But do it quietly and in moderation.

79
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,200
Don't push it.

80
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,533
I'm warning you.

81
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,834
Wait. Take that with you.

82
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,300
Even impostors need to do their job.

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,800
But…

84
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:05,333
will it be a meaningful marriage?

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,600
-What did you say?
-Just…

86
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,033
something to consider.

87
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,100
It's been a while
since we spoke like this.

88
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,266
I suppose so.

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,100
You've really outdone yourself.

90
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,934
You sound irritated.

91
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,667
No.

92
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm being sincere.

93
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Everything I did was
because I deemed it my duty.

94
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,533
I have no regrets about my decision.

95
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,667
In that respect, I hope…

96
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,000
you can keep our secret.

97
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:56,500
I've been in this play you created
before I even realized it.

98
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:58,867
Don't worry.

99
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:04,200
I have my reasons
for wanting this play to end in peace.

100
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,000
Anyway, the kid is a hired actor.

101
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,367
He isn't related to the family.

102
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,633
His reality is worlds apart from yours.

103
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,066
Once this ends,

104
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,834
everything will return to normal.

105
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,100
I'll make sure of it.

106
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,333
"Return to normal," huh?

107
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,500
Will that be possible?

108
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,834
It was better

109
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,100
when I believed that
he was Se-yeon's cousin.

110
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,000
The fact that he's a total stranger

111
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,100
keeps me on edge.

112
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,033
Like there's a thorn in my side.

113
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,066
Does this sound odd to you?

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,400
Are you talking about gongalchigi?

115
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:08,400
Gosh, you call golf that?

116
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,133
-Yes.
-Wow.

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,934
The thing is,

118
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,834
Sang-ji is setting up a get-together.

119
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,266
It's obvious she has something
to brag about.

120
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,500
I know you'll be uncomfortable,

121
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,767
but I couldn't possibly turn her down

122
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,934
when she's made reservations
for all six of us.

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,900
Why should you? Let's all go.

124
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,633
-Really?
-I actually wanted to see her again.

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,433
It's a piece of cake.
Gongalchigi's got nothing on me.

126
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm afraid Comrade Ri isn't home yet.

127
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,500
We need to talk.

128
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,133
What are you trying to do?

129
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,233
Sorry?

130
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,533
You must know that I know the truth.

131
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:25,934
Well…

132
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,700
please turn a blind eye, just this once.

133
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:34,967
I wanted to do this for Ji-won's sake.

134
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,233
Please go along with it just this once.

135
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,867
Nice shot!

136
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,834
This is my first game of gongalchigi
in the South.

137
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,333
-Huh? What's that?
-Great hit! That ball!

138
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,667
-Wow.
-That's amazing!

139
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,700
Comrade Jin-suk, give that new club
of yours a good swing!

140
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,266
Damn it.

141
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,300
Don't go in. Don't go in.

142
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,767
-Man, I think luck's on my side today.
-Wow! That's amazing!

143
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,967
Maybe it's the fresh air out here,

144
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:06,767
but those golf balls
are hitting just right.

145
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,000
-Isn't that ri--
-Excuse me.

146
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,567
Is it really your first game?

147
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:15,200
Oh, well, didn't I tell you before?

148
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,367
It's my first time in the South.

149
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,834
-What?
-I guess you wouldn't know,

150
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,433
but people play gongalchigi
in the North too.

151
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,033
That's right. Comrade Jin-suk,
your play today was exceptional.

152
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,667
Oh, my. Sang-ji.

153
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,700
It's been a while, Sang-ji.
I didn't know you were in Korea.

154
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,033
Who are you?

155
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,233
We were at the same study community.

156
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,433
You were studying for Harvard,
and then I heard…

157
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,066
you didn't make it.

158
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:47,333
Have you quit your life abroad
to settle down?

159
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,600
Wait. Who are you to come here
and say such things?

160
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,533
-Honey, it's not true.
-Hey.

161
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,066
Didn't you say you graduated from Harvard?

162
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,266
Well, to explain briefly…

163
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,133
-The thing is--
-Graduated? From Harvard?

164
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,100
Is that what you've been saying?

165
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Oh, my. I spoke out of bounds. I'm sorry.

166
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,333
No, honey, that's not it.

167
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,333
-She's mistaken me for someone else.
-She said your name.

168
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,233
She said your name: Sang-ji.

169
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,233
I don't understand.

170
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,867
Who was that?

171
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,266
I'm sorry that
you didn't make it to Harvard.

172
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,834
No, that… That's not…

173
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,133
Don't be too distraught.

174
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,266
Life is recreation, no?

175
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,800
Hey, stop talking nonsense!

176
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,500
Honey! Damn it!

177
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,233
Oh, dear. I'll be seeing you.

178
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,667
Hey, you're good.

179
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,166
Wow.

180
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:30,834
Ri Moon-seong.

181
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,533
You may have tasted capitalism,

182
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,033
but your punch is lethal as ever.

183
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,166
Met your grandma?

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,567
Why does that surprise you?

185
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:03,800
Isn't the bastard who came looking for you
the type to give up his organs for money?

186
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:09,734
He said I'd find you
near Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun's house.

187
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,967
He was eager to tell me that.

188
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Time's not on your side.

189
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,066
-What do you mean?
-Jang Jin-suk.

190
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,133
What about my wife?

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,033
I came all the way here

192
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,000
because I can find her a liver.

193
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,266
I thought this skillful
and good-looking fella

194
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:55,166
was on a crazy prowl for money,
so I looked into it.

195
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,700
You sure have a tear-jerker story.

196
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,066
If I pull some strings,

197
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,734
finding a compatible liver
won't be an issue.

198
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,734
Even multiple homicide offenders
can go anywhere in the world

199
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,633
if I pull my strings.

200
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,667
For someone like me,
finding some liver or kidney is no biggie.

201
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,033
How can I trust you?

202
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,133
Ri Moon-seong.

203
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:35,300
You should save Comrade Jin-suk
while you can, no?

204
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,233
I had the liver,

205
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,834
but I said nothing
because I knew you were broke.

206
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,900
If I knew you had such a grandmother,
I would've pulled them strings already.

207
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,367
Having a grandmother who can buy you
hundreds of livers--

208
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,233
Now, that can make the grim reaper
have a change of heart.

209
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:04,066
Stop wandering in the gold mine
and dig up some money.

210
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,367
How did it go?

211
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:28,200
I got what I need during the interview.
Now I'm writing the article.

212
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,266
Speed up the process.
Please tell me before you publish.

213
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:33,900
All right.

214
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,400
What should I do?

215
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,734
Do you want tomorrow's article
to be about Nakwon's hidden grandson

216
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,934
or about your marriage?

217
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,767
Please write the latter.

218
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,166
There's a price for each article.

219
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,600
Let's help each other out.

220
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,133
If I shift gears here,
Se-jun will never speak to me again.

221
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll provide exclusive information
on our hotel.

222
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,700
We'll be the first to know?
Is that a promise?

223
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,867
Yes.

224
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,133
I gave you enough time to think, no?

225
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,000
Your decision's obvious.

226
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,967
Taking any more time
is just avoiding the inevitable.

227
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,767
I need to hear it from you.

228
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,333
Okay, let's do it.

229
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,633
Let's get married.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,667
But I am the general manager here.

231
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,734
It's only sensible
that I get married here.

232
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,900
I'll tell Ra-kyung
to set up a wedding planner.

233
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,834
You can tell her what you need.

234
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Let's make it simple.

235
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,500
You know very well
what your family is like.

236
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,500
They dislike me,
and they look down on my family.

237
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,567
It's upsetting.

238
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:33,266
So this time,
let's take care of our own families.

239
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,166
Anything else?

240
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,033
No, not yet.

241
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,166
Okay. Let me know if there's anything.

242
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:49,567
Shall we go?

243
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,600
-Aren't you coming?
-I am.

244
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,667
I wanted to show it to Grandma.

245
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,867
That maybe…

246
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,967
her grandson and his wife
would've lived a happy life.

247
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,333
Comrade Jin-suk.

248
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,700
You're home.

249
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,867
-There was so much laundry today.
-Aren't you tired?

250
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,033
Aren't I tired? Of course I am.

251
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,233
But it's my job.

252
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,100
You're a full-on employee now.

253
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,400
Right?

254
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm confused whether I'm an actor
or an hotel employee.

255
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,900
-I get confused too.
-About what?

256
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,767
About what I am.

257
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:32,567
Hey, come to think of it,

258
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,734
why did you join the theater group?

259
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,667
That's random.

260
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:39,734
Hey.

261
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
I don't know who you are.

262
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,400
Who are you?

263
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,767
Since I was a kid, all I did was study.

264
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,767
That's true for everyone.

265
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:58,066
Everyone said studying is difficult,
but it was easy for me.

266
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,867
So full of yourself?

267
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:03,533
My mom always told me
to become a lawyer like her.

268
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,867
So I thought I had to.

269
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,700
It's better to start sooner than later.

270
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:14,633
All I did was study hard, and I ended up
skipping grades up until college.

271
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,166
Hey.

272
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,033
You… were a real prodigy.

273
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,633
After I finished law school,

274
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,333
things became clear.

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,533
I realized I'd done nothing with my life.

276
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,467
I had no friends or memories.

277
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,734
I just…

278
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,700
wanted to make memories
at a place no one knew me.

279
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,200
Theater. For fun.

280
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,300
Acting is fun. Performing in plays is fun.

281
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,800
It's also thrilling to live
as another person.

282
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,333
So this is just…

283
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,467
a memorable experience?

284
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,667
What?

285
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,300
Are you offended
I don't take it seriously?

286
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:02,066
Goodness. Not at all.
That's not what I meant.

287
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,767
You were only trying
to make good memories,

288
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,433
but perhaps I took it too far

289
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:14,834
and got you involved in this big mess.

290
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,266
I feel bad.

291
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,400
There's no need.
I do it because I like acting.

292
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,133
Thank you for saying that.

293
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,367
-Why do you think I like it?
-Huh?

294
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
What do you think I like about it?

295
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,533
This play.

296
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:48,166
Forget it. Let's drop it.
Just go wash up and sleep.

297
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,166
Hey, let me answer that question.
I think I know.

298
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,266
Money. It's because of money, right?

299
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,767
It's true we're being overcompensated.

300
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,433
Hey, get lost.

301
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,734
-What?
-I said, get lost.

302
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,233
I wanted to be alone.
Stop bugging me. Get lost.

303
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,600
-What? Hey. Fine.
-Go away.

304
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,867
-Go away. Hurry up and go away.
-Hey, lower your voice!

305
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:20,266
Forget whether you're a prodigy or not.
Get a hold of that temper first.

306
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,800
-You little-- Come here.
-Your temper…

307
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,300
-Fine, I'm going.
-Go.

308
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,567
Oh, you scared me.

309
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:46,066
How long have you been standing there?

310
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,100
When you started talking about
how smart you are.

311
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,900
You must've heard everything.

312
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

313
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,467
Yoon-hee.

314
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:06,834
Let's say someone meticulously made

315
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,100
a cat-shaped figurine with chocolate.

316
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,300
Would that make…

317
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,700
just a chocolate or a cat?

318
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,734
-Chocolate, of course.
-That's right.

319
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,900
If you know that it's chocolate.

320
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,734
But for those who don't know?

321
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,367
They won't dare eat it
because they wouldn't know it's chocolate.

322
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,200
What are you trying to say?

323
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,633
If no one tells them the truth,

324
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,467
to them,

325
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,734
it isn't chocolate.

326
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,467
It's simply a cat figurine to them.

327
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:55,133
It's not important
whether someone is perceptive or not.

328
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:58,734
It's cold. I think I'll be going in.

329
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,667
Thank you.

330
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,767
So I have to tell him
if I want him to know.

331
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,600
PARK SE-YEON OF NAKWON
TO MARRY BAE DONG-JAE OF WOOSANG

332
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,633
What happened?

333
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,367
Sorry about this.
You understand the situation?

334
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:33,934
Do you think I'll let this slide?

335
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,633
She threatened to sue
for obstruction of business.

336
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,734
I had no choice but to write this.

337
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:43,367
Park Se-yeon wasn't one
to be meddled with.

338
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:47,233
I don't know what's with your family,
but I'm staying of out it.

339
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,533
My apologies.

340
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,900
My gosh. Director Park.

341
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,066
How are you?

342
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:13,100
You still have Ri Moon-seong, right?

343
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,633
What? Yes, of course.

344
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,767
You told us to keep a low profile for now.

345
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,433
So we did as we were told.

346
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,467
You might have to make a move soon.

347
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll let you know.

348
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:28,800
Yes, of course.

349
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,834
We're on standby.
We're waiting for your orders.

350
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes, sir.

351
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,033
This is bad.

352
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:40,600
Wait a second. Damn it.

353
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:48,600
Sir, Se-jun is looking for Moon-seong.
He might make a move soon.

354
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,633
Really? Okay.

355
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,934
I did tell him that I had him,
but this is driving me nuts.

356
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,600
Where do you think that punk is?

357
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,600
Isn't it your job to find out?

358
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,133
You're right.

359
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,567
I'll let you know if I find anything.

360
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:06,433
Bye.

361
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,266
Just wait until I find you.

362
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,133
Here.

363
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,567
Yes. It's for you.
Why else would I bring two cups?

364
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,734
-Thank you.
-No problem.

365
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:44,166
You look like you want to kick yourself.

366
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:46,734
What is it?

367
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,867
Is Moon-seong giving you a hard time?

368
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,934
No, that's not it.

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
What do you mean, no? You look upset.

370
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,834
It's nothing.

371
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,934
If he can be so sweet to Grandma,

372
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,533
why isn't he more attentive to you?

373
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,333
Should I teach him a lesson?

374
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:19,300
The baby briers are in bloom…

375
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,934
What's this song called?

376
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,333
Huh? Do you mean "Baby Briers"?

377
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,500
So it's called "Baby Briers."

378
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,400
It's what you sang in the living room
when you first came here.

379
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
-"Baby Briers."
-Right.

380
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,967
You used to sing farewell songs to me…

381
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:44,266
About 20 years?

382
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,066
Yes, I think it's been about 20 years.

383
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:51,266
Since someone sang to my grandma.

384
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,500
I will never forget you

385
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,133
You sing really well.

386
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,834
That's when I first knew

387
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,300
that Grandma likes to clap to music.

388
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,967
There weren't any occasions to sing
since my parents passed.

389
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,367
And then we all became adults.

390
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,567
Adults who don't get along.

391
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,300
-You should've come earlier.
-Sorry?

392
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:26,533
If you two came earlier,
we might've turned out different.

393
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,033
Seeing us get along,
Grandma might've lived

394
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,734
to be 100 years old.

395
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:36,200
It's a pity.

396
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:45,467
The baby briers are in bloom

397
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:54,266
THINGS YOU REGRET THE MOST
BEFORE YOU DIE

398
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,533
LET'S MAKE GRANDMA
AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE!

399
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,667
A festival?

400
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,834
Yes.

401
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,867
For Grandma's happiness,

402
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:21,133
how about the daughters-in-law
prepare a festival for her?

403
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,633
You mean we should hold an event, right?

404
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Well, yes, I guess an event.

405
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:31,967
You mean we should prepare
something Grandma would like

406
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,100
to surprise her in a good way, yeah?

407
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,533
Yes. That's what I mean.

408
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,066
Now that I think about it,
Grandma has been unwell,

409
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,467
but I've never done
anything meaningful for her.

410
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:44,400
That's how I felt as well.

411
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,033
Why don't we go out to a nice restaurant?

412
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,834
Actually, scratch that.

413
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,100
She's not well,

414
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:56,400
so it'd be difficult for us
to take her out somewhere far.

415
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,533
Do you have anything in mind?

416
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:05,066
I actually have planned something.

417
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:15,100
What are you doing all this for?

418
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,600
Hold on. Just a little more, please.

419
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,133
Don't open your eyes, okay?

420
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,400
-Gosh.
-Okay. One, two, three.

421
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,567
What is all this?

422
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,400
We've prepared this for you.
We're calling this

423
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:36,033
the Geum-sun Spa.

424
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,567
What are you thinking of doing?

425
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,967
Don't worry. I knew you would say that,

426
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,900
so we prepared a small event.

427
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,133
We've never done much for you.

428
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,266
But we worried
going out would be too cumbersome.

429
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:56,100
That's why we put this together.

430
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,934
Seriously, you must have
a lot of time on your hands.

431
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,133
Okay, Grandma.

432
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,467
We're going all out today.
Please sit here.

433
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,800
Is the water warm enough?

434
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:13,100
It's nice.

435
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,667
It's very nice.

436
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,734
Now, I'll start the massage.

437
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,700
Just a moment.

438
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Wow, that feels good.

439
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,500
Is it not too strong?

440
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,266
Hey, how come you are so weak?

441
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:35,500
Have you been starving for days?

442
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,433
Apply more pressure.

443
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,266
-More pressure?
-Yes.

444
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,200
More pressure coming up.

445
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,266
Let's make that medium pressure.

446
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,433
All right. Medium pressure it is.

447
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,633
Gosh, that's nice. That feels good.

448
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,200
-Do you like it, Grandma?
-Yes.

449
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,800
You're good, Jin-suk.

450
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,200
You have many talents, child.

451
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,433
I've made some good money with this
back in China.

452
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, I see.

453
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:21,934
All I had was time,
so I started drawing on fingernails.

454
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
That's how I became good at this.

455
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,767
I see.

456
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,133
So? Do you like it?

457
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:42,834
It's beautiful.

458
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,166
It represents the four seasons:
spring, summer, fall and winter.

459
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,166
I see.

460
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:55,934
I drew this wishing that…

461
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,834
you'd stay with us year after year

462
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:04,400
and season after season.

463
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,066
Jin-suk.

464
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:19,333
It seems we haven't had the chance
to talk to each other much.

465
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,834
I want to get to know you.

466
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,500
What kind of person you are.

467
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,734
I hope I was given enough time

468
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,300
to learn more about you.

469
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,834
Chairwoman, drink these while you do that.

470
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,467
Grandma, here's what we're doing next.

471
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,400
Gosh. There's more?

472
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,633
What is all this?

473
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,000
Is this a beauty salon?

474
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,333
We're only open for today.

475
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,500
How can you leave me out
when you're having so much fun?

476
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,900
Our only customer today is Grandma.

477
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,066
Isn't it better to have more employees?

478
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,500
Do you want to do this together?

479
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,900
-What is it?
-This is…

480
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,700
Wow.

481
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,900
This will smooth out your wrinkles.

482
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:17,867
Here.

483
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,934
Now that you mention it,
it does feel like my skin is tightening.

484
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:25,266
Like I'm going back
to when I was your age.

485
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,033
Right?

486
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,333
Your face will shine after this, Grandma.

487
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,300
You shouldn't let your guard down
because you're young.

488
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,600
If you don't take care of your face now,

489
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,967
age will get to you.

490
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,567
This all comes from experience,
so mark my words, okay?

491
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,066
Understood?

492
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:49,166
Okay.

493
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,300
-It's okay. You can stop.
-No, it's fine.

494
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:55,900
I'll do everything today.

495
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,867
Ji-won, come here.

496
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,367
Shall I?

497
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,600
-That was good, right?
-Whose idea was it?

498
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:11,166
Jin-suk's idea.
I mean, you're so thoughtful.

499
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:15,233
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.
You're so adorable.

500
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:24,233
-Was it your idea?
-It was nothing.

501
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,200
I just wanted to do something for Grandma.

502
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,800
We should do this for her
since we're family.

503
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,266
Don't you think?

504
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,667
Jin-suk.

505
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,433
Thank you.

506
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,200
Sure.

507
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,834
This whole time…

508
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:53,367
I thought I was waiting for you.

509
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,567
But I was wrong.

510
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:02,433
You were waiting for me.

511
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,967
I'm sorry.

512
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,834
I'm so sorry.

513
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,700
Moon-seong.

514
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:58,033
I miss your grandma exceptionally today.

515
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,266
Aren't we seeing her
at next year's event anyway?

516
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,734
Hurry. You must go inside.

517
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,967
I brought you some soup.

518
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:12,633
Since Grandma adores you,

519
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,066
she will take good care of you.

520
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,834
Isn't that right, Mother?

521
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:25,333
You know I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings, right?

522
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:29,600
You didn't even know about
Moon-seong's existence.

523
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,100
You didn't seem to care about
how Father died.

524
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,066
It felt like you only cared
for your family in the South.

525
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,633
I was just being petty.

526
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:46,700
A place where people die from hunger,
torture and illness.

527
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:52,734
You abandoned your family
in such a place where you're left to die.

528
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,367
But you built some shiny fortress
for yourself!

529
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Grandma.

530
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Grandma!

531
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,433
Hey, man.

532
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,166
-What's your problem?
-My problem?

533
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,700
What are you doing in public?

534
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,734
I take it by your accent and your outfit

535
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,633
that you're not from here,
so what business have you here?

536
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,700
What's wrong with my outfit?

537
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,500
Watch your mouth.

538
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,533
This is Ri Moon-seong.

539
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,033
Let's meet.

540
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,300
Ri Moon-seong!

541
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:52,367
-Get off.
-Wow, you punk.

542
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:56,667
Hey, did I not give you a phone?

543
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,567
Why weren't you using it?

544
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:02,934
Is it so difficult for you to tell me
where you are and what you're doing?

545
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,000
I decided to meet him.

546
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,000
Meet whom?

547
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:08,767
Park Se-jun.

548
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
What?

549
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,533
It's time I reclaim my place.

550
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:25,633
Whoa, man.

551
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:27,533
Did you see this?

552
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,033
-Gotta see it to tell you.
-Show him.

553
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,166
-This one is huge.
-What is it?

554
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,834
PARK SE-YEON OF NAKWON
TO MARRY BAE DONG-JAE OF WOOSANG

555
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,967
What's up?

556
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,533
This is a hotel, a public space.

557
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,333
I'd appreciate if you could give me
a heads-up before you come in.

558
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,600
-Is it true?
-Is what true?

559
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,433
Is that article worth
running to my office?

560
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,667
Of course it is.

561
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:29,066
How could you not tell me about this?
I'm your cousin.

562
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:30,400
Cousin?

563
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,166
Who's my cousin?

564
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,367
What I mean is…

565
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:41,166
You said you won't marry him.
You don't want to.

566
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:42,367
You're right.

567
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:45,667
-Then what's up with this article?
-I don't want to marry him.

568
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,367
But I have to.

569
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,233
Why would you say that?

570
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,834
It's because of you.

571
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:57,500
-What?
-My cousin Ri Moon-seong

572
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,533
turned out to be a fake.

573
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,500
The real one is in touch with Se-jun,

574
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,900
so what does this all mean?

575
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:11,233
I was already losing
this battle with the shares.

576
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,066
If I want to stop Se-jun
from selling off the hotel,

577
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,066
I need Dong-jae's shares.

578
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:20,500
That doesn't mean you should marry him.

579
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:24,767
You need love to date someone,

580
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:29,100
but you can marry out of necessity.

581
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,233
Come on, Se-yeon.

582
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,667
This is my life and my decision.

583
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,934
No one can judge me for this.

584
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,900
You heard what I had to say.
So please go. I'm busy.

585
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:12,834
PARK SE-YEON

586
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:17,333
Yeah, what is it?

587
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,934
Okay.

588
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,867
Guys, have you heard?

589
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,467
He's coming tomorrow.
The man who's marrying Se-yeon.

590
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:45,467
-Are you talking about Bae Dong-jae?
-Yes.

591
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:48,066
I think he's coming
to meet the chairwoman.

592
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:51,834
There's so much gossip in the news,
so I wasn't sure.

593
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:55,533
But he really must be coming.
It's great news, right?

594
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,867
Indeed.

595
00:45:57,934 --> 00:46:00,066
It must be happening.

596
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,934
-Let me get you a cup of tea.
-Sure.

597
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,533
Thank you.

598
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:16,066
You asleep?

599
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:18,367
Yes.

600
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:20,233
Hey…

601
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,200
Never mind.

602
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,066
Se-yeon, when you're feeling down,
eating good food is the way to go.

603
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:58,000
It has everything I like.

604
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Look at this.
Look how long the rice cake is.

605
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:02,767
Wow.

606
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,900
I noticed earlier
that you weren't in a good mood.

607
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:09,800
Your expression said it all. Here.

608
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,166
Try it.

609
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,700
Come on, try it.

610
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What's this? Wow.

611
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:21,033
This is so good. It's crispy and soft.

612
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,133
Come on and try it, Se-yeon. Come on.

613
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,467
Here, try it.

614
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,100
It's good.

615
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:46,367
Se-yeon.

616
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,100
Did something happen?

617
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,066
Jae-heon.

618
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:02,367
Yes?

619
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,834
Never mind.

620
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
All right.

621
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:34,467
You good?

622
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:35,700
Yeah, I'm good.

623
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,266
Let's go in.

624
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:45,734
So,

625
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,333
you two are getting married?

626
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,333
-Yes, ma'am.
-You haven't set the date yet, have you?

627
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,633
No.

628
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:59,800
You don't have to rush into anything
because of me.

629
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:03,600
Do what you guys want to do

630
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,834
and let it unfold naturally.

631
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,400
Yes, Grandma.

632
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,467
All right.

633
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,066
I'm well aware
that you aren't exactly fond of me.

634
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,133
-I will try my best and--
-Dong-jae.

635
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:28,934
I never actually disliked you.

636
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,133
All I wanted was for Se-yeon
to do what she wanted,

637
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,266
not something she didn't want.

638
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:45,000
You haven't changed at all.

639
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:50,467
You are smarter than anyone,
but you cannot relate to others.

640
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:56,000
It would've been wonderful
if someone taught you

641
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:59,033
how to win a person's heart.

642
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:05,967
But that's not something you can learn.

643
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,433
If you ran into Mr. Jeong,

644
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:20,567
that means Se-yeon knows you are here.

645
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:22,066
Do you still need time

646
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:25,233
to prepare for what's to come?

647
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,734
Nothing's going according to plan.

648
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,600
But isn't that what life is about?

649
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,834
Life would be too easy
if it went according to plan.

650
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:37,734
Se-yeon will stop this by any means.

651
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,667
We need to time this right
so that we can talk to Grandma alone.

652
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,266
Let me ask you something.

653
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,000
-What is it that you want?
-What I want?

654
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:57,166
It feels like the family

655
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,166
isn't exactly welcoming me.

656
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,333
That's why I'm curious.

657
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,633
What do you want from me?

658
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:18,800
I hate that hotel.

659
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,834
Looking at it reminds me
of all the bad memories.

660
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:29,633
Grandma always said she wanted
to build a hotel that's like a lighthouse.

661
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,567
And she did.

662
00:51:35,734 --> 00:51:39,567
It's like a lighthouse. A lighthouse
that can be seen from anywhere.

663
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,667
I'm going to sell that hotel.

664
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:57,000
If you inherit Grandma's fortune,

665
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,200
hand over the shares to me.

666
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,033
I'll pay you handsomely. Very handsomely.

667
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:11,033
With that much money,
you'll live comfortably for life.

668
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,633
I'll get what I want,

669
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,700
and you'll get money.

670
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,467
Isn't that enough?

671
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:30,767
Is that enough?

672
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,166
Is it?

673
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:39,133
When Grandma passes away,

674
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:41,233
you have no place here.

675
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,367
I see.

676
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,567
Do whatever you want.

677
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,867
I hate the hotel too.

678
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:59,033
Man, that punk.

679
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:02,600
My job is done here.

680
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,767
I'll send you my bank account number.

681
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,600
All right? I'll get going.

682
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:29,166
Can you return home?

683
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:33,633
For as long as the chairwoman lives,
make yourself scarce.

684
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,266
When Grandma passes away,
you have no place here.

685
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,000
Fuck!

686
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,100
-What the hell?
-Damn it.

687
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:55,066
Hey, keep it down, will you?
What's with all the noise?

688
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:02,200
-You.
-What?

689
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:03,433
Hey!

690
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
What?

691
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,900
Mind your own business and just drink.

692
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:13,166
What's with his accent?
Where are you from?

693
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,166
That punk.

694
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:18,400
Stop trying to look cool.
You're ruining the mood here.

695
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,000
Go back to your country, you bastard.

696
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:23,567
You're not welcome here!

697
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:25,834
Hey, that's enough.

698
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,800
What? Did I say something wrong?

699
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:30,900
Hey! What are you glaring at me for?

700
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:33,834
-You bastard.
-Oh, no!

701
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,900
You prick!

702
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,834
-Stop it!
-Damn it!

703
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:42,667
You fucking bastard!

704
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,600
Gentlemen, many apologies.

705
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,934
Are you kidding me?
Don't you see there are three of us?

706
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:53,600
I hope this will suffice?

707
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,100
Apologies, sir. My apologies.

708
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,600
-Excuse me, sir.
-My place is a mess.

709
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:01,700
Sorry for your trouble.
The man's got quite a history.

710
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:05,967
This isn't much, but I'd appreciate
if you could let this one slide.

711
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:07,867
Terribly sorry, sir.

712
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,066
People shouldn't run their mouths
just because someone has a weird accent.

713
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:14,834
-What?
-Forget it.

714
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:21,834
Hey. Learn to control your temper, man!

715
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,433
This place isn't like your hometown.

716
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,133
You get into real trouble
if you beat people up or kill them.

717
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,266
I never killed anyone.

718
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,100
What do you mean? I heard you did.

719
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,800
But I don't murder people.

720
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,133
Really? Okay.

721
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,233
Hey, get up.

722
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,767
Get up. Have you eaten yet?

723
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:50,000
Let's have gukbap and soju.
When you're wasted, those are the best.

724
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,166
Let's go. Lose that temper, okay?

725
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,333
Aren't we done talking?

726
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,233
Why would you say that?

727
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,667
You got what you wanted.

728
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,066
Now that you know everything,

729
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,367
you know the sword's in your hands,
so I'm sure you'll wield it.

730
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,533
I want to ask…

731
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,000
Ask away.

732
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:24,400
I understand why Se-yeon needs my shares.

733
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:27,967
-Since your cousin is an impostor.
-So?

734
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:30,467
But why don't you need my shares?

735
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,633
I've thought about it, and I seemed odd.

736
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,800
You're back to square one.

737
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:43,166
So if Se-yeon gets my shares,
isn't it a risk for you?

738
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:47,000
So what is it?

739
00:56:49,266 --> 00:56:50,367
What could it be?

740
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,533
Think carefully.

741
00:56:58,867 --> 00:56:59,967
You found him.

742
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,133
The real one.

743
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,066
So you're the one holding the sword.

744
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:14,600
Be careful, though.

745
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,667
The sharper the sword,

746
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:19,900
the deeper the cut.

747
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,300
See you around.

748
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,700
SOME WORDS MUST BE SPOKEN FOR
THEM TO KNOW TO SPEAK OR NOT?

749
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,367
That's what relationships are like.

750
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,166
Once it's formed,

751
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:48,967
it doesn't change easily.

752
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,633
In order to change it…

753
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,066
you'll need courage.

754
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,100
All right.

755
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:21,033
Let's do it.

756
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:11,433
Are you really going to?

757
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:15,900
Stop it.

758
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:21,100
Are you really going through with it?

759
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:29,567
It's been confirmed.

760
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,367
Officially and unofficially.

761
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,166
No.

762
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,533
No, no, no.

763
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:46,166
It makes no sense to go through
with an unwanted marriage. No.

764
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:48,767
Is that all you can say?

765
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:50,400
It's a done deal.

766
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,200
Let's talk about something else
rather than just saying no.

767
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,667
I have feelings for you.

768
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,767
I like you, Se-yeon.

769
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,166
I do.

770
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,367
I like you too.

771
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,033
CURTAIN CALL

772
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,667
What kind of relationship…

773
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:29,967
do you two have?

774
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,600
Do you like him?

775
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:38,333
I can't even begin to understand women.

776
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,500
You came to the right place for advice.

777
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,200
Oh, man…

778
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,600
Ri Moon-seong, you're back.

779
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,333
Don't you resent your grandmother?

780
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,667
How're you liking the ocean here?

781
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:56,033
The ocean is just an ocean.

782
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:59,767
Mr. Ri Moon-seong,
let me cut to the chase.

783
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,834
Please leave. As if you knew nothing.

784
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,934
But I want Grandma to suffer.
