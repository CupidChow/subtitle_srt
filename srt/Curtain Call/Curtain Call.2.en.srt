00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:36,972
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:11,972
I wanted to make a hotel
that was like a lighthouse,

3
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:17,271
thinking that he could find me that way.

4
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,605
Grandma!

5
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,638
Grandma!

6
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,238
It's me, Moon-seong!

7
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,405
We said we'd meet again!

8
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,505
Grandma, it's me!

9
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:41,171
Grandma!

10
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,338
Moon-seong?

11
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,238
-Moon-seong?
-Chairwoman.

12
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,738
There's no hope, is there?

13
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,472
Any questions?

14
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:42,338
I'm wondering
if I really understood this correctly.

15
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,805
Let me try summarizing this
in three sentences.

16
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,405
One:

17
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:50,939
This grandma's last wish

18
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,072
is to meet her grandson from North Korea.

19
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:58,572
Two: But she can't bring him here

20
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,171
from North Korea.

21
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:03,772
Three:

22
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,238
Therefore, you need someone…

23
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,872
to act like her grandson…

24
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:17,405
and you're suggesting
that I play that role?

25
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:19,472
Exactly.

26
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,305
But why me?

27
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:24,072
One:

28
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,472
You're a theater actor about his age
with a good North Korean accent.

29
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,171
Two:

30
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:35,371
You're an unknown actor,
only doing small plays at local theaters.

31
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,171
Three:

32
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:42,305
You look like an actor who would do
anything to change his life.

33
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,572
But here's the thing.

34
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,338
Isn't this whole thing a fraud?

35
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,705
If the lie is created
for someone's happiness,

36
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,405
could we really call that a crime
or a fraud?

37
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:19,638
So, for how long?

38
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,371
Three months.

39
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,171
Three months?

40
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,839
If we're talking three months,

41
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,605
I have to leave the theater group.

42
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,905
I won't be able to work my part-time job.

43
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,939
I have to provide for myself, you know.

44
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:42,205
You'll be paid handsomely.

45
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:45,939
Handsomely?

46
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:50,338
How much are we talking?

47
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,405
You're paying me three million won
for three months?

48
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,772
100 million won a month

49
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,672
isn't cheap.

50
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:14,538
CAFÉ

51
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:38,205
The French Quarter is in the city
of New Orleans.

52
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,438
The home of jazz music.

53
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,238
Its streets look European,

54
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:46,905
and jazz music permeates
the entire neighborhood.

55
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,872
Doesn't that sound amazing?

56
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,371
Should we go there now?

57
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,605
Let's go right now.

58
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,605
No, no. Don't feel uncomfortable.
No need for that.

59
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:03,072
See? Just go with this feeling.

60
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,672
Just press this button,

61
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:09,271
and we'll be in the sky in three hours.

62
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:13,105
We'll be drinking champagne
in the French Quarter by tomorrow.

63
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:15,371
Anyone have an appointment tomorrow?

64
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:18,572
-And our child?
-You startled me. What the hell?

65
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:23,905
He cries for Daddy every day.
You can't just leave him like this.

66
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:26,371
Hey, stop it. Not funny.

67
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,872
Girls, listen.
I know we don't look alike, but--

68
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,705
-Honey.
-Did she say "Honey"?

69
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:38,105
I'm fine with you cheating,
but don't do this to our child.

70
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,371
Hey, do you really believe her?

71
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,505
Man, I think you do.
You're a great actress--

72
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,572
-Honey!
-"Honey"? Stop it!

73
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,472
Crazy bastard.

74
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,105
Thank you.

75
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,438
Hey, hey!

76
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:00,738
What the…

77
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,839
What in the…

78
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,205
How did you know I was there?

79
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,271
It's easy to find you.

80
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,238
Search some popular clubs and bars.

81
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,405
Call a few places, and voilà.

82
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,005
I do get around a bit, don't I?

83
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,105
-And you like that?
-I do.

84
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,705
-You know--
-No.

85
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:32,872
-Se-gyu.
-No.

86
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,939
I didn't say anything yet.

87
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,438
You want me to take your side
in the liquidation deal, no?

88
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,271
Well, you're quick.

89
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,171
I won't.

90
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,138
You should know better.

91
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:50,105
As soon as I became an adult,
I gave up my company voting right.

92
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,205
But you can still use it.

93
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,005
Help me.

94
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:59,338
I want to protect our hotel.

95
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,438
Don't get upset at me for saying this.

96
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,171
I don't really care what happens.

97
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:15,505
If we sell, we get a lot of cash.

98
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:19,638
If we keep them, I keep the good title:
Nakwon Group's second son.

99
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,738
You actually don't care.

100
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:25,905
Se-yeon.

101
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,371
If I side with Se-jun, you'll hate me.

102
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:33,405
If I side with you, Se-jun will hate me.

103
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,738
I hate stuff like that.

104
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,238
What if we both hate you?

105
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,405
-That's fine.
-What?

106
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,672
To me,
that's the same as you both liking me.

107
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,305
You know what I'm saying?

108
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,872
No!

109
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,171
Jong-mun!

110
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,305
Yeong-hoon!

111
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,371
Chairwoman, are you all right?

112
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,605
It's bad enough that I cry in my dreams,

113
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,305
but I'm even waking in tears.

114
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,939
Did you have the same dream again?

115
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:47,072
Mr. Jeong, I'm not dead yet.

116
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,271
Stop staring and help me get up.

117
00:09:56,538 --> 00:10:00,105
I don't have much time left.

118
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,538
I must be more productive.

119
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,305
How's Se-jun?

120
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,538
He's waiting for you outside.

121
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,605
Let's go.

122
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:23,939
Mr. Kim seems to think
I can't make sound decisions

123
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,072
because I'm old and sick.

124
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,305
Do you feel the same?

125
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:35,405
All he did was devise the best option
while you were gone.

126
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,972
And that's to sell the hotels?

127
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:45,705
Se-jun.

128
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:50,138
I'm well aware that we can't always agree

129
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,005
and always have the same vision

130
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:56,705
just because we're a family.

131
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:01,972
Just look at you, Se-gyu and Se-yeon.

132
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:07,371
Though you all come from the same womb,
you're all so different.

133
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,939
Still, I spent my whole life

134
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,572
putting my heart and soul
into nurturing this hotel group.

135
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:20,472
I don't believe
this is just business for you.

136
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,205
This hotel provided us sustenance.

137
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:27,538
It has protected us thus far.

138
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:30,772
Do you think that's all that it did?

139
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,238
I see.

140
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,805
That's what Nakwon is to you.

141
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,572
I say this for the future of the hotels.

142
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,472
If we're bound to our past,
we won't be able to move forward.

143
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:05,305
You're not wrong, but I hope…

144
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,872
that you appreciate the value of our past
a little more.

145
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,505
Even the painful parts.

146
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:30,872
Time is on your side.

147
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:35,238
There's no need to rush.

148
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:59,138
Jeong-suk, why don't you join us?

149
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:02,271
Sit here. You too, Mr. Jeong.

150
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,105
I have a few chores left. I'll eat later.

151
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:09,738
I don't have much time left to sit
and enjoy a meal with everyone.

152
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:15,138
I want to eat together, so join us.

153
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,205
Sit.

154
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,039
How does it taste?

155
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:25,672
It's good.

156
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,005
Jeong-suk.

157
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:33,305
You've been with us
for a long time, right?

158
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,072
It's time you left this place.

159
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:40,972
Find yourself a new place.

160
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:42,805
Grandma.

161
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,805
You can't just suddenly ask her to leave.

162
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,839
Am I wrong?

163
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:51,005
Why the sudden change?
We have a big family.

164
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,371
Chairwoman Ja.

165
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,472
I'm over 50 now.

166
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,839
Is that so?

167
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,271
Let me stick around

168
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,039
for as long as you're here.

169
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,171
Is that what you want?

170
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,405
Yes.

171
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:49,371
Don't work too hard.
You should rest when you need to.

172
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,638
You don't have to leave either.

173
00:14:58,538 --> 00:14:59,972
Even after Grandma passes,

174
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,472
this is your home.

175
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,872
Darling.

176
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:17,705
Hey.

177
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,238
Is this the guy?

178
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,405
Yeah.

179
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,472
I kept telling him I have a boyfriend,
but he keeps saying it doesn't matter.

180
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,171
Are you really Hyo-jin's boyfriend?

181
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:54,705
Hyo-jin, you don't have to put on an act.

182
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,338
I don't want much from you.

183
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,538
I just need you to know how I feel.

184
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,672
Excuse me.

185
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,605
Been watching many romantic movies?

186
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:11,772
This lovey-dovey feeling of yours,
it makes you feel pretty special, huh?

187
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,505
Everything you do with that feeling
makes you feel good about yourself too.

188
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:19,738
The thing is, your actions are…

189
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:23,205
It's borderline stalking.

190
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:25,738
Stalking.

191
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,939
Stop bothering my girl from now on.

192
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:45,638
Stop now, and I'll let you off the hook.
I'll say you just had a simple crush.

193
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:50,171
Memories are beautiful things, huh?

194
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:10,572
He left?

195
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:15,738
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:16,805
It's okay.

197
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,138
-So, was that okay?
-It was great.

198
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,171
Oh, really?

199
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:26,672
The rent-a-boyfriend service
recommended you.

200
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:28,371
I can see why.

201
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:32,839
-You were good.
-Oh, no. I've done this a few times.

202
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,338
Thank you.

203
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,638
Let's meet again if we get the chance.

204
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:46,705
Sure.

205
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,371
Jae-heon.

206
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,438
I loved what you said.

207
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:58,472
I think you're going to make it big.

208
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,238
I'll be waiting for your call.

209
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,338
Mr. Park, you're going to break your back.

210
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,572
Oh, my! It's our superstar!

211
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,405
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

212
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,972
So, how much are these?

213
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,438
This vehicle isn't in the cards for you.
Forget it.

214
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,905
What, I can't even ask?

215
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,238
Hello!

216
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:09,972
-You know why we brought four of these?
-Why did you?

217
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,472
Because you're both beautiful!

218
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,138
Is it the two of you?

219
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,039
-Yes.
-It's the two of us too.

220
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,638
Cheers!

221
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,505
Wait. We should-- Where--

222
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,138
Come on!

223
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,238
I am the king!

224
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,605
Why is this so bland
fresh out of the bottle?

225
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:00,672
I wonder why.

226
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,338
-We'll be like him one day, right?
-Yeah.

227
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,438
That probably costs a pretty penny, huh?

228
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,105
Can I get another pint?

229
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:21,672
First off,
the chairwoman wrote her will long ago

230
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,572
to divide everything evenly
among the three of you.

231
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:28,572
Se-jun gets the lion's share
because he gets Dad's inheritance.

232
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,138
Plus, he's second in command.

233
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:33,872
Se-gyu was never interested in this,
so he's already forfeited

234
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:36,505
his voting power or rights
to take over the group.

235
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,538
If you combine everything,

236
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,538
Se-jun would own the largest share
of the company.

237
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,005
So there's no way for you to block
the liquidation deal.

238
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:46,738
That's right.

239
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,171
I can't see a way out of this.

240
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:54,705
Finding a worthy male shareholder
might get you to save the hotel.

241
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,405
Thank you.

242
00:20:58,738 --> 00:20:59,738
Here.

243
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,638
Any secret children in your family?

244
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,371
What are you talking about?

245
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:14,205
No, I'm just saying.

246
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:20,305
If you have an ally to divide the shares,
you'll have a chance at saving the hotel.

247
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:40,772
You recover your health,
and you're back at it already.

248
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:42,738
Why aren't you asleep?

249
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:45,738
I woke up because of your footsteps.

250
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,171
I can't believe you can hear them.

251
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,772
Isn't it weird?

252
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:54,171
I can hear footsteps even in my dreams.

253
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:57,972
I wake up because it sounds like
you're right beside me.

254
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,072
No. Don't drink.

255
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:11,505
Here.

256
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:15,939
Have this warm drink and go to bed.
No more alcohol.

257
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,039
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,438
After Grandma passes…

259
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:34,238
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

260
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:38,839
Today's trouble is enough for today.

261
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:42,238
Delaying can't prevent it either.

262
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:44,438
So for today,

263
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:48,271
have your glass of milk and get some rest.

264
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,438
MAY EXPENSES AND INCOME

265
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:07,538
So, 4,000 won per delivery.
That's 40,000 won.

266
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,371
She loves me,

267
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:12,905
she loves me not.

268
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:15,438
It's only an infatuation. 300,000 won.

269
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:19,171
If I get work at the fried-chicken place,
I'm okay for this month.

270
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,672
OPEN AUDITIONS
FOR MALE & FEMALE ACTORS

271
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:33,105
500 million won.
Anything higher is too much.

272
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,505
Grandma.

273
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,972
Do you resent me?

274
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,872
No. What are you talking about?

275
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:09,039
I found out why Se-jun despises Nakwon.

276
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,572
So I've chosen not to intervene.

277
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:16,872
Se-jun hates Nakwon

278
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,371
as much as you love it.

279
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,305
Hating something and loving something

280
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:27,538
is like going from living
to entering the afterlife.

281
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,772
It's only one step away.

282
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,138
Se-jun wants to get rid of Nakwon.

283
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,238
But you want to protect it.

284
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:45,872
Whoever is more earnest…

285
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,939
will determine the outcome.

286
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:12,572
Yoo Jae-heon?

287
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,072
Yes, sir.

288
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,638
Sit, sit.

289
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:19,171
Yes, sir.

290
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:22,572
Jae-heon,
you've done a lot of part-time jobs.

291
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,105
Thank you.

292
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:28,005
Why have you listed your part-time jobs
on your résumé?

293
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:29,138
It's my specialty.

294
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:31,939
-Doing part-time jobs?
-No.

295
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:35,972
I think I learned many skills
through working those jobs.

296
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,605
I didn't write this,
but I can play golf too.

297
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:40,371
-Golf, huh?
-Yes.

298
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,305
-What do you shoot?
-Around 80.

299
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:45,438
Eighty?

300
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:47,672
That's why I wrote them down.

301
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,039
He's funny, huh?

302
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:51,772
Let's see the selected scene first.

303
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:55,772
Yes, sir.

304
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:02,805
MALE & FEMALE ACTORS
OPEN AUDITIONS

305
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,939
Goodbye.

306
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:17,738
Oh, man.

307
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:22,772
I think I got the job.
Should I quit my part-time jobs?

308
00:26:25,972 --> 00:26:27,538
AUDITION RESULT

309
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,205
WE REGRET THAT WE WON'T
BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU

310
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:35,105
You could have said this…

311
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:37,839
to my face!

312
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:45,705
Damn it. Was it the Method acting?

313
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,905
Damn it.

314
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,805
Less Method acting, Jae-heon.

315
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:57,905
Corporations are filling
the conference schedules.

316
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:01,405
I'll meet directly with the clients
who want to use the Grand Ballroom.

317
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:04,405
-Yes, ma'am.
-It's quite a prominent hotel.

318
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,138
Full booking, okay?

319
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,672
Interpret, please.

320
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:10,939
It's at the peak now.
All rooms are fully booked up this month.

321
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,705
-That's great.
-Sorry. This way.

322
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,205
This way.

323
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,605
The evaluation team from Bilton.

324
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:34,905
That's all for today.

325
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,605
-But what about these?
-The end!

326
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:57,238
Are you finished?

327
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:00,505
Fully charged for battle.

328
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,605
It's not over for me yet.

329
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:07,072
When I managed long-term guests,

330
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:10,171
I was legendary
for getting $10 tips every day.

331
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,105
When the guests checked out--

332
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,672
You received $100.

333
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:17,538
-From the ground up, I built--
-This beautiful hotel.

334
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,438
I can't let him sell it.

335
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:21,805
I'm going to find a way.

336
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,005
Speaking of which,

337
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:29,039
let's talk about the VVIP room,

338
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,572
the one that costs 20 million won a night.

339
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:33,638
What about it?

340
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:35,438
Someone booked it today.

341
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:39,072
And for next three months,
it's a long-term guest.

342
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,171
-Really?
-Isn't that amazing?

343
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:44,772
Wow, who is this VVIP guest?

344
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:57,438
Miss Cheon Ju-yeong?

345
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,205
Oh, yes.

346
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,772
I'm Park Se-yeon,
Hotel Nakwon's general manager.

347
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,772
You're the first person to book
our one-of-a-kind room.

348
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,072
We wanted to thank you
for staying with us.

349
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,905
Oh, thank you.

350
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:16,338
Did we disturb you?

351
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,405
Oh, no. Not at all.

352
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,405
The thing is…

353
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,271
We prepared something special for you.

354
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,072
May we come in?

355
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:30,905
Sure. Come on in.

356
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:51,072
Hello.

357
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,505
General Manager Park Se-yeon.

358
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,505
I'm an unknown actor.

359
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:12,605
Meaning, nobody will recognize me.

360
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:15,839
I'm broke,
and I have a good North Korean accent.

361
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:19,205
That's why you chose me, right?

362
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:21,772
That's what I said.

363
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:28,039
But I can't do it only for those reasons.

364
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:30,072
So I thought about it.

365
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:33,438
How I want to act.

366
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:36,738
What it means to be an actor.
A real actor.

367
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:39,805
So?

368
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,572
Even if it's for one person,

369
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:45,105
if they can feel happiness or comfort
from my performance…

370
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:48,371
that's real acting.

371
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:51,005
That's a real actor.

372
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:56,039
So, are you in or are you out?

373
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,638
The play you suggested,

374
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:02,572
it'll bring joy to the last moments
of the grandma's life.

375
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:04,638
Correct.

376
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:11,939
If that's so,

377
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,605
I'll play my part.

378
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:18,738
Grandma, this way. Father, you too.

379
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:21,039
THE TWO KOREAS SHARING
THE JOY OF FAMILY REUNIONS

380
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,338
RI MOON-SEONG - JA GEUM-SUN

381
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:28,039
We should take this picture

382
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:31,238
so you can tell how much I grew
next time we meet.

383
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:34,039
You're right. That's true.

384
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,672
One, two, three.

385
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:43,405
I said I'll play the grandson.

386
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:49,772
But now that you say that, I'm conflicted.

387
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,072
You're thinking
you're paying me too much, huh?

388
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:54,238
No!

389
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,138
Absolutely not.

390
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,839
Take a seat.

391
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:11,472
No, thank you.
We can hear fine from where I am.

392
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:14,405
What's with the stiffness?
You're no amateur.

393
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:18,872
Twenty million won a night
for three months, all paid up front.

394
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,972
I'm allowed to congratulate you, no?

395
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:24,039
After all, we almost married each other.

396
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:25,972
That's all this is?

397
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,238
Who gives two billion won
to an ex-fiancée's hotel grand opening?

398
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:33,772
Thanks to this,
I finally see you in person.

399
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,905
You were sure hard to reach.

400
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:38,672
The two billion won was worth it.

401
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,405
What do you want?

402
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:44,805
I can't tell you so easily, can I?

403
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:46,438
You're right.

404
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,972
Then rest well.

405
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:53,371
You'll soon come looking for me.

406
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,305
I wanted to save you the trouble
of traveling the distance.

407
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,738
I reserved it to be close to you.

408
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:03,805
I'll come looking…

409
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,039
for you?

410
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,738
I guess you're actually working
on something.

411
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:16,705
The thing is,

412
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:20,138
I loved being Se-yeon's man.

413
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,972
Let's see what you do.
I look forward to it.

414
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:34,638
Now, the three elements of a play.

415
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,039
The stage.

416
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:40,472
The actor.

417
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,072
The audience.

418
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,939
This play we're doing is different.

419
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,305
-In what way?
-The audience.

420
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,039
The audience knows
that they're watching a play

421
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:55,138
by seeing the actors act on stage.

422
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:57,705
But our play requires the audience

423
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:01,605
to never know
that they're watching a play.

424
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,538
There is an audience.

425
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,371
One man will know that it's a play.

426
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:12,805
One man will watch the play until the end.

427
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:16,271
Me?

428
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:21,072
The actor Yoo Jae-heon

429
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:24,338
will perform before an audience of one.

430
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:27,171
So…

431
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:31,939
a play for an audience of one?

432
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,605
An audience…

433
00:34:37,972 --> 00:34:39,338
for one person?

434
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,572
I really didn't know.

435
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:50,638
If I'd known Dong-jae booked the room,
I would have told you.

436
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:53,805
I know.

437
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,005
I'm okay.

438
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,505
I'm going home.

439
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:01,839
Okay.

440
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:08,205
The harder the quest, the more fun it is.

441
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,638
Marriage is no exception.

442
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,839
Mom.

443
00:35:54,638 --> 00:35:56,839
Why am I so afraid?

444
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:10,039
US-BOUND PLANE CRASHES

445
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:13,105
AND KILLS CEO AND WIFE
OF NAKWON HOTEL GROUP

446
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,105
What's this about?

447
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:36,672
What are you doing up so late at night?

448
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,238
We're having a party.

449
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:42,005
Three months if I do this.
Three months if I do that.

450
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:44,205
I'm going to do whatever I want.

451
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,138
Grandma, let's hold off on the wine.

452
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,405
Hey, this isn't wine.
It's 100% grape juice.

453
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:55,438
If I don't drink before I sleep,
I have nightmares.

454
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,271
-But you really shouldn't drink.
-Hey, don't you dare.

455
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:02,572
Should I just give you more stocks?

456
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:09,205
You should spend your youth
having your heart flutter over a man

457
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:12,438
and lose some sleep over it too.

458
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:15,872
Instead, you're always
next to your grandmother like a child.

459
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:18,705
Of course, you're not dating or married.

460
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:20,705
Wow.

461
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:24,605
-Can I have some wine too?
-Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

462
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:26,305
Very well.

463
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,805
Wait. What is wrong with your hand?

464
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:36,672
Oh, I was painting something
before I came.

465
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,271
Oh, that's great.

466
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,472
Such dark colors
should be painted on paper.

467
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,472
Not on your heart.

468
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:48,205
-You know, right?
-Of course I do.

469
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,405
Okay, dinner's ready.

470
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:59,039
-That looks so good.
-Smells good. Mr. Jeong, get over here.

471
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,805
No, ma'am. I'm fine.

472
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:02,972
Oh, come on. Quickly.

473
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,939
Come on, Mr. Jeong.

474
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,772
Come, pour me a glass.

475
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:10,171
Here we are.

476
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:16,805
What is it?

477
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,805
Something happening?

478
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:25,105
Grandma's drinking wine.
She shouldn't be drinking.

479
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,039
Honey, should we join them?

480
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,605
Why aren't you asleep?

481
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,572
Where did he go? Let's join them!

482
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:39,805
Was the last report lacking?
You told me to identify the person.

483
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,972
Why type everything
when I can just say it?

484
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:48,105
I can't even ask someone else to do it.
I suck at typing--

485
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:53,039
I love how you do business.

486
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:54,405
I respect you, sir.

487
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,438
If people find out

488
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:05,405
that I found Ri Moon-seong…

489
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:12,205
it must be through your lips.

490
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:14,338
Isn't that right?

491
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:18,105
Who is this Ri Moon-Seong?

492
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:21,605
Good. I'm out.

493
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:26,205
Goodbye, sir.

494
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:33,905
Who exactly is Ri Moon-seong?

495
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,238
He retired years ago,

496
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:40,305
and yet he's worked up
like he's on active duty.

497
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,171
There's no problem. None.

498
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,939
Okay, so let's sign this contract.

499
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,271
You'll be paid the day you begin.

500
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:11,438
It'll be deposited when you arrive home.

501
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:21,105
I charge for prepping too.

502
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,738
From what I understand,

503
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:27,271
the show must air
for the actors to be paid anything.

504
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:32,705
Yeah, okay. I understand.

505
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:37,905
Here's the information on her grandson,
Ri Moon-seong.

506
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:51,138
Do you need the background information
to create the character?

507
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:53,605
People who are good actors do.

508
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:04,105
I'm finishing up the play I'm in now,
so once I'm done,

509
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,072
I'll build this character

510
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,072
and get back to you.

511
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,205
Then…

512
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,171
you are now under contractual obligation.

513
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:36,772
JILIN, CHINA

514
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:24,505
Is it true?

515
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:26,371
Moon-seong?

516
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,839
You found Moon-seong?

517
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:30,872
Yes, Chairwoman.

518
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:33,805
How? How did you find him?

519
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:37,005
I asked a detective
I've known for a long time.

520
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:40,939
He said he finally found him
after years of searching.

521
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:44,505
Where is that boy?

522
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,305
He's in China.

523
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:50,039
It may take time,
but he's a Chinese citizen.

524
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:53,271
I don't think he'll have a problem
coming to Korea.

525
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,772
So, shall we bring him?

526
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:16,505
Are you sure it's him?

527
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:22,271
Yes.

528
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:26,371
He's for sure Ri Moon-seong,
the son of Ri Yeong-hoon.

529
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:35,872
Ri Moon-seong.

530
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,138
JANG JIN-SUK

531
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:04,438
HOW JANG JIN-SUK DIED

532
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:09,572
This is a problem.

533
00:44:09,638 --> 00:44:12,039
BASIC INFORMATION
RI MOON-SEONG

534
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,238
What do I do?

535
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:25,105
I have something to tell you.

536
00:44:26,939 --> 00:44:28,839
I told you before.

537
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:33,538
There is a grandson
I left behind in the north.

538
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:37,405
Grandma,
why are you bringing him up so suddenly?

539
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:39,872
Someone's found him.

540
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:46,572
As long as I'm here,

541
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:49,271
he will live with us.

542
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:51,538
Grandma!

543
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,939
He's coming from China.

544
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,638
Just keep that in mind.

545
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:59,705
It may be awkward,
since you're meeting your cousin

546
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,238
so late in life.

547
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:06,638
Just think of him
as your long-lost brother.

548
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,738
Please take care of him.

549
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,672
That's all. Go about your day.

550
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:16,138
Wait, Grandma.

551
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:19,271
This isn't something
you can just notify us about.

552
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:21,939
-How old is he?
-Why do you want to know?

553
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:25,805
I'm the youngest.
I want to know if he's younger.

554
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:30,505
How can you be so casual
after hearing this shocking news?

555
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:32,572
He's younger than you.

556
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:34,572
Really?

557
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,171
That's pretty amazing.

558
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:39,238
Getting a little brother at this age.

559
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:40,939
Congratulations.

560
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,472
What in the world?

561
00:45:43,138 --> 00:45:44,238
Hey, you asleep?

562
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:47,572
What's up with this reaction?

563
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:50,572
Am I the weird one? Am I the bad guy?

564
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:51,972
He's suffered enough.

565
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:55,672
It's beyond anything you can imagine.

566
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,538
Take care of him when he gets here.

567
00:45:59,638 --> 00:46:00,705
Understand?

568
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:02,738
Yes.

569
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,872
Wait. Do I need to look him up?

570
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,738
Let's draw this family tree.

571
00:46:20,805 --> 00:46:23,538
Are we from different mothers? No.

572
00:46:23,605 --> 00:46:26,005
Our grandma bore our fathers, so…

573
00:46:26,772 --> 00:46:30,205
Our grandma's elder son was in the north--

574
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,505
So he's our cousin.

575
00:46:33,438 --> 00:46:35,572
Our fathers are brothers

576
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:37,972
from different fathers.

577
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:41,872
Well, that was easy.

578
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:44,338
You really are the eldest.

579
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,405
You knew about him too.

580
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:51,205
Grandma spoke about him countless times.
So why are you shocked?

581
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:53,538
I didn't think he'd actually be found.

582
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,338
It's a good thing he's been found.

583
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:01,039
You know nothing.

584
00:47:01,105 --> 00:47:04,238
You're a fool who knows nothing
but this hotel.

585
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,271
Mr. Jeong, what have you done?

586
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,805
What do you mean by that?

587
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,839
What are you saying?

588
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:36,839
The grandchild who suddenly appeared?

589
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,105
The timing is questionable.

590
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,338
He didn't appear suddenly.

591
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,138
I've been looking for him for some time.

592
00:47:45,872 --> 00:47:47,238
I just haven't told you.

593
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:50,772
So, he didn't appear suddenly.

594
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,105
It's that I informed
the chairwoman suddenly.

595
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,205
Also, if not now,

596
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:58,271
it would all be meaningless.

597
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,538
Have I made a mistake?

598
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:10,271
See you around.

599
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:34,638
BAREUN CHICKEN
IT'S BETTER BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN

600
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,205
This is different.

601
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:51,672
This chicken is made
via the artistry of perfect timing.

602
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,105
One spoon of my soul.

603
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:01,905
You need to boost your artistic senses.

604
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:06,371
Jae-heon, need I put you in your place?

605
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:08,772
I'm not kidding.

606
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:13,105
Want to change the way you see art?
Become a true artist and train with--

607
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:14,238
What's this?

608
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:16,271
Why are you so dramatic?

609
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,105
There's this North Korean grandma
who succeeded massively here.

610
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:31,672
JANG JIN-SUK

611
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,338
CAUSE OF DEATH

612
00:49:38,505 --> 00:49:41,005
LOCATION OF DEATH

613
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,205
How sad.

614
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,072
So…

615
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:56,605
I wanted to show this old woman…

616
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,738
that maybe

617
00:50:01,638 --> 00:50:04,805
her grandson is living a happy life,
with a wife and all.

618
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:11,005
A new young master is coming.

619
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:13,105
China.

620
00:50:13,705 --> 00:50:14,705
Oh, China.

621
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:20,839
If he comes with his wife,
I get another sister-in-law, right?

622
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:24,839
Does this mean
he's getting some of the inheritance too?

623
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:27,839
Would Grandma do that? Do those kids--

624
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:32,572
I mean, do those people
know anything about hotels?

625
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:34,839
Se-gyu doesn't know anything either.

626
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:36,905
Right?

627
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:41,238
I'm the eldest, and Se-yeon learned
the business from the bottom up.

628
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,772
Even so,
Grandma didn't leave us a dime more.

629
00:50:45,138 --> 00:50:47,072
He's family. She won't exclude him.

630
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:50,705
I'm so tired.

631
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:54,072
I'm going to bed.

632
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:08,672
Check with shareholder Gu Seong-hoe.

633
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:12,839
Report if the chairwoman or Mr. Jeong
has been meeting with the lawyers.

634
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:45,138
-You're home? You're late.
-Mom, where are you going at this hour?

635
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,839
One of my cases has become
very complicated.

636
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:53,905
Oh, boy.

637
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,772
You said today was
your last performance, right?

638
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,972
Will you return to the States now?

639
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,205
No.

640
00:52:04,405 --> 00:52:07,705
You won't take the test?
You graduated from law school way back.

641
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:10,638
After one last play.

642
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:15,872
Even if you run first in a line,
it's all useless

643
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:19,072
if you stop right before the finish line.

644
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:25,072
You're wasting your time
with your childish dreams.

645
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:28,271
I can't come home for three months.

646
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:33,905
Return to the US after that, okay?

647
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:39,972
-You're so consistent, Mom.
-Seo Yoon-hee--

648
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,138
If you want to stop me,
at least come see my play.

649
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:47,305
Shouldn't you at least see
how your daughter acts on stage?

650
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:52,505
So, what kind of play is this one?

651
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,072
When? Where?

652
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,238
Who.

653
00:52:57,305 --> 00:53:00,772
You may not care,
but the point of this play is just that:

654
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:02,705
who.

655
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:10,039
I'm on my way.

656
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:18,072
Just go. You can't come anyway.

657
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:39,105
Who, and with whom?

658
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:41,772
Seo Yoon-hee and Yoo Jae-heon

659
00:53:43,105 --> 00:53:45,238
are going to play husband and wife.

660
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:50,138
QUALITY

661
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:54,772
Dude-- I mean, Mr. Jeong--
it looks pretty good, right?

662
00:54:05,105 --> 00:54:06,238
Say hello.

663
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,605
This young lady…

664
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,972
is going to play your wife?

665
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,472
Oh, no.

666
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:19,872
I told you multiple times, comrade,
call me Ri Moon-seong now.

667
00:54:20,538 --> 00:54:23,939
And call her Jang Jin-suk.
Isn't that right?

668
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:27,505
That's right.

669
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:30,605
A random mistake can change
the course of things.

670
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,738
Take this seriously.

671
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:43,705
Used clothes get sold around
and eventually go to China.

672
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:46,271
Instead of an awkward-looking setting,

673
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:49,138
we'd rather go to a flea market
to get what we want.

674
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:50,672
Wouldn't that be better?

675
00:54:50,738 --> 00:54:53,505
-Hey, second floor.
-Wait up!

676
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:05,872
-These look good-- Oh, you scared me.
-This will do.

677
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,005
Wow!

678
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:11,072
Hey, hey. Look at this.

679
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:18,905
One, two…

680
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,538
-Me?
-That's good.

681
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:23,705
Yeah.

682
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:26,338
Oh, good.

683
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:29,039
-Here.
-For a keepsake.

684
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:30,572
One, two, three.

685
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:36,371
Here you are.

686
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,405
JANG JIN-SUK

687
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:47,572
RI MOON-SEONG

688
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:50,271
As long as they don't use it,
it should be fine.

689
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,371
Got it.

690
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:58,371

PROFILE - JANG JIN-SUK

693
00:56:54,072 --> 00:56:56,072
Isn't this a counterfeit passport?

694
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,505
Will we need to use this?

695
00:57:00,405 --> 00:57:03,472
Well, let's hope you won't have to.

696
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:09,205
But it's possible
someone may check your identities.

697
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:22,005
Now that he is coming tomorrow,

698
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:25,338
I'm not sure how I should act.

699
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:27,005
I mean,

700
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:29,538
you have men in your family.

701
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:32,972
You have two brothers.
Just do as you always have.

702
00:57:33,872 --> 00:57:35,705
No. Absolutely not.

703
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,405
Treat him like Se-jun?

704
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:43,305
-Treat him like Se-gyu?
-Oh, can't do that.

705
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,672
So,

706
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:53,805
in times of crisis, do what you do best.

707
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:56,805
-What I do best?
-Greeting guests.

708
00:57:57,572 --> 00:58:00,039
Isn't that what Park Se-yeon does best?

709
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:02,805
That's true.

710
00:58:04,572 --> 00:58:05,939
But he's my cousin.

711
00:58:06,872 --> 00:58:08,305
He's a guest.

712
00:58:08,872 --> 00:58:11,839
He could give you the chance
to keep this hotel.

713
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,738
He's your most precious guest.

714
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:17,538
A VIP guest?

715
00:58:32,405 --> 00:58:33,538
What are you doing?

716
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:36,638
Going home.

717
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:38,872
Do you practice your smile after work?

718
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:42,405
-Mind your own business.
-Someone coming?

719
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:44,939
A VIP guest.

720
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:48,105
There's another VIP here besides me?

721
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:51,271
I'm burning 200 million in three months.

722
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:53,572
You're nothing in comparison.

723
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:57,572
Also, you're sticking around
despite our refund offer.

724
00:58:57,638 --> 00:59:01,905
So you should be blacklisted instead.

725
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:08,205
A VIP…

726
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,205
A VIP guest, huh?

727
00:59:17,438 --> 00:59:19,205
Chairwoman.

728
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:28,972
If you get in her way,
she'll whack you with a ladle.

729
00:59:30,238 --> 00:59:34,171
You can tell when someone's smiling
even when looking from behind.

730
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:39,039
I have to ask, though.

731
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:43,271
What if this man is of bad character?

732
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:45,138
You never know.

733
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:47,839
The chairwoman is so excited.

734
00:59:47,905 --> 00:59:51,171
If he's not what she expects,
she'll be shocked, and her health--

735
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:53,039
Jeong-suk.

736
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:54,805
Yes, ma'am?

737
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,039
-Shall I move it?
-Yes.

738
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:10,638

740
01:00:31,772 --> 01:00:33,305
Hey, Jang Jin-suk.

741
01:00:34,105 --> 01:00:35,872
-Come here.
-What?

742
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:39,338
Hey, link arms with me.

743
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,872
We're married. People who date do that.

744
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:46,805
We don't have to practice this.

745
01:00:46,872 --> 01:00:48,305
I told you I'll do fine.

746
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:49,772
Hey, Yoon-hee.

747
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,271
We have to practice
these little things so that--

748
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,305
You ready?

749
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:10,872
Let's go.

750
01:01:27,872 --> 01:01:31,839
He's about to arrive. Come on out. Hurry.

751
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:39,572
Se-gyu, come on. Let's go.

752
01:01:41,438 --> 01:01:43,205
-Let's go.
-Fine.

753
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,039
Grandma, we're ready.

754
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,039
Yes, okay.

755
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:05,972
CURTAIN CALL: TREES DIE STANDING

756
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:10,271
Which wealthy family would welcome
a stranger into their family?

757
01:04:10,338 --> 01:04:12,772
The haves don't like change.

758
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:17,072
You went through so much coming here.
I want to do everything I can for you.

759
01:04:17,138 --> 01:04:18,405
Come back quickly, okay?

760
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,238
Mom!

761
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:25,972
You definitely performed a miracle
bringing Ri Moon-seong back.

762
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:29,972
Your hands are so smooth.
He must really love you.

763
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,705
You have iced black coffee
in North Korea too?
