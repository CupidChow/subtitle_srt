3
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,039
Are you really going to marry him?

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,060
Stop it.

5
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,880
Are you going to do it, for real?

6
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,029
It's already a settled matter.

7
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,619
Officially and unofficially.

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,520
No, I don't like it.

9
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,360
No, no, I don't like it.

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,189
I mean, how does it makes sense to
get married when you don't want to?

11
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,289
I don't like it.

12
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,459
Is that all you can say?
That you don't like it?

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,190
It's already a done deal.

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,260
Stop saying you don't like it, and
let's talk about something else.

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,030
I like you.

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,659
I like you, Noona.

17
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,589
♫ When even the awkward
regrets pass by me ♫

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,590
♫ When I can smile just a little bit ♫

19
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,339
I like you, too.

20
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,049
♫ Even the words, "You
look good," push me ♫

21
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,280
♫ In just one moment, my
heart feels heavy again ♫

22
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,559
My cousin, Moon Sung.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,809
I felt that way from the
moment I first saw you.

24
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,169
You were kind,

25
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,599
cheerful,

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,369
and pure...

27
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,769
You really seemed like my younger brother.

28
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,499
Who are you?

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,519
I know Rhee Moon Sung,

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,329
but I don't know Yoo Jae Heon very well.

31
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,809
♫ With only the sad memories ♫

32
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,809
Are you telling me that you like me

33
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,310
as Rhee Moon Sung

34
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,369
or as Yoo Jae Heon?

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,369
♫ Let's not push away a
future relationship again ♫

36
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,370
♫ For as long as I hesitated,
I want to be even happier ♫

37
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,119
♫ It's not easy because
I just feel so sorry ♫

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,169
♫ Perhaps I won't be able to
fill that space for a long time ♫

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,299
♫ I don't dislike it ♫

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,549
♫ Looking at you from back then ♫

41
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,319
♫ With only the sad memories ♫

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,169
Uni Jjajang.

43
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,749
Are you sleeping?

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,749
♫ Covering me as I fall asleep ♫

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,439
♫ At the end of the seasons,
where my time has stopped ♫

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,800
♫ I turn the page that's filled with
you, it's finally time for goodbye ♫

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,799
♫ I'm fine ♫

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,819
♫ When a bit more time passes by ♫

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:17,789
♫ Only the faint good memories
will be left as a good fragrance ♫

50
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,719
♫ Now, I will search for happiness, too ♫

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,689
I like you, Noona.

52
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,799
I like you.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,750
♫ Though it won't be easy ♫

54
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:37,610
♫ Since that's probably
what you want for me, too ♫

55
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,440
Damn it, the sun's up.

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,729
Are you telling me that you like me

57
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,930
as Rhee Moon Sung

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,160
or as Yoo Jae Heon?

59
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,980
Noona.

60
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,010
You're not going to work yet?

61
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,310
I do need to go.

62
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,309
D-Do you want to go together?

63
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,850
I'm thinking of leaving a bit later.

64
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,570
You go first.

65
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,390
World Championship...

66
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,400
Aren't you here to drink coffee?

67
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,139
I've brewed some already.

68
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,240
Do you want to drink it together?

69
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,110
What's the relationship between you two?

70
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,380
What do you mean?

71
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,490
The two of you.

72
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,479
Well, that's...

73
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,909
There's nobody here right now.

74
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,240
You can talk to me comfortably.

75
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,799
For Jae Heon oppa,

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,779
he probably just sees us as fellow
actors at a theater company.

77
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,560
I see.

78
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,979
Now that I think about it, it must have been
hard pretending to be a married couple.

79
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,919
I mean, it's just acting,

80
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,089
so it's not that different from
what we did at the theater company.

81
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,589
You guys are always together

82
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,689
sharing the same room
and sleeping together,

83
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,499
and you even share the same bathroom.

84
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,600
That's comparable to what you
do at the theater company?

85
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,089
In order for fellow actors of a
theater company to live like that,

86
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,360
it would have been difficult
on multiple levels.

87
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,060
Well, yes.

88
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,469
You said just before that for Jae Heon,

89
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,779
you guys were probably just fellow
actors at a theater company.

90
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,390
Yes.

91
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,690
What about for you, Yoon Hee?

92
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,569
Do you also see yourselves
as just fellow actors?

93
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,400
No.

94
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,449
It's not like that for me.

95
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,300
Then it must've been even more
difficult acting like a married couple.

96
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,039
Then can I ask you one thing, too?

97
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,540
Yeah.

98
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,220
Unni, do you like Oppa?

99
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,279
Well...

100
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,109
if you're asking about my cousin Moon Sung,

101
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,750
then I do really like him.

102
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,440
Then, that's a relief.

103
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,380
The person I like is Jae Heon
oppa, not Rhee Moon Sung.

104
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,709
You've already announced
that you're getting married.

105
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,399
I know you keep public and
private matters separate.

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,909
But I asked just in case.

107
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,289
If I think about it

108
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,919
there's no reason for someone who
has everything like you, Unni,

109
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,189
to like a guy who has
nothing like Yoo Jae Heon.

110
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,189
I guess I was worried for no reason.

111
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,609
Right?

112
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,630
♫ What should I do? ♫

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,929
♫ Where should I go? ♫

114
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,039
I'll be on my way first.

115
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,900
♫ The days I've wandered ♫

116
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,380
♫ I get lost again ♫

117
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,340
I should have asked her

118
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,150
why she likes him.

119
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,600
(Yoo Jae Heon? How do I feel? I should tell him, but I don't know,
Should I or shouldn't I?) ♫ I grow weak when I stand in front of you ♫

120
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:45,720
♫ Stand by your side, I'm right here ♫

121
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,049
If I think about it,

122
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,889
there's no reason for someone who
has everything like you, Unni,

123
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,530
to like a guy who has
nothing like Yoo Jae Heon.

124
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,289
I guess I was worried for no reason.

125
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,889
Right?

126
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:09,890
♫ Even when I walk in pitch
darkness, you become my light, more ♫

127
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:19,270
♫ Even when I look so shaky I'll
fall over, you hold my hand, more ♫

128
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,919
Oh, Rhee Moon Sung.

129
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,969
Shall we go grab a beer
after we're done today?

130
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,489
- Deal?
- Deal.

131
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,950
Deal?

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,429
I'm going to just go home today.

133
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,170
Quietly.

134
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,159
Oh, really?

135
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,390
Oh, o-okay.

136
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,599
♫ There are things I shouldn't love ♫

137
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,350
♫ Things I shouldn't try to get ♫

138
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,099
♫ Words telling me to stop ♫

139
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,690
♫ I guess it's already too late for me ♫

140
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,919
♫ Hoping that it won't be love
that I started by myself ♫

141
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,920
♫ I'm praying with my hands together,
as if trying to take a breath ♫

142
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,449
♫ Someone that I shouldn't love ♫

143
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,559
♫ That person is you ♫

144
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,199
♫ Although I can't tell you all
these words I've hidden in my heart ♫

145
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,499
I like you.

146
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,019
♫ One day not too close but not too far ♫

147
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,839
I like you, Noona.

148
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,909
♫ Holding you in my arms ♫

149
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,499
♫ Will I be able to tell you I love you ♫

150
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,250
I know Rhee Moon Sung,

151
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,030
but I don't know Yoo Jae Heon very well.

152
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,589
Cousin!

153
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,279
- Oh, you're here!
- Yeah.

154
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,110
What's the occasion that
you called me up first?

155
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,820
All right, cheers!

156
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,360
Hyungnim, this might be a strange question.

157
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,879
But no matter how much I think about it,

158
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,649
there was nobody else
that I could ask but you.

159
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,579
Oh, of course!

160
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,620
Ask away, cousin.

161
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,629
What do you need to do to charm a woman?

162
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,939
Why?

163
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,939
Aren't you getting along with
Sister-in-law these days?

164
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,769
Yes... well...

165
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,439
that's true too, but

166
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,059
I just can't seem to
understand how women think.

167
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,839
Well, you came to the right person.
I'm an expert.

168
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,299
All right.

169
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,859
When I am with a woman,

170
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,369
there are two scenarios.

171
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,349
She has to like me.

172
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,729
Every minute, every second, I need
to use all the nerves in my body

173
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,229
to sense and target that.

174
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,469
Then what do you have to do?

175
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,060
I need to express my honest
feelings wholly and tell her.

176
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,549
If she doesn't accept my feelings, then...

177
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,739
Then you say screw you,
turn around, and leave.

178
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,969
Wouldn't it be better to try
accommodating her- - I told you, no!

179
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,860
Show yourself to her just as you are.

180
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,720
Do you know what I mean?

181
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,219
Do you also see yourselves

182
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,179
as just fellow actors?

183
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,330
It's not like that for me.

184
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,110
You probably didn't call me to just chat.

185
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,260
It is. I called you, so we could chat.

186
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,879
My father...

187
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,649
wasn't particularly interested
in doing the hotel business.

188
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,320
He just...

189
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,290
thought of it as his duty.

190
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,390
And Se Yeon is bearing that burden now.

191
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,469
I feel no sense of obligation

192
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,279
toward our hotel,

193
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,009
and no feelings for it, either.

194
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,089
I'm only pushing for

195
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,479
the sale of the hotel because
it's the best time for it.

196
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,660
It's nothing more and less than that.

197
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,580
But it's different for you, isn't it?

198
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,080
Aren't you resentful?

199
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,959
While you and your father

200
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,089
were going through such hard times there,

201
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,779
we were living here lacking nothing.

202
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,649
No,

203
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,359
the word "lacking" doesn't
even begin to describe it.

204
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,670
We were overflowing in
abundance in everything.

205
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,269
Aren't you resentful of Grandmother?

206
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,349
You hate us for living a
completely different life than you.

207
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,040
Isn't that right?

208
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,969
I don't want you...

209
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,690
to forget that feeling.

210
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,889
Aigoo, you scared me.

211
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,479
I'm not even surprised anymore.

212
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,949
It's fine for you to visit, but
at least have the lights on.

213
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,779
You would run away

214
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,260
if you saw the lights on from outside.

215
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,409
So,

216
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,749
how did it go?

217
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,329
Well, Park Se Joon, Rhee
Moon Sung, and I met up,

218
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,830
but that Park Se Joon is a pretty cold guy.

219
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,909
It seems like Rhee Moon Sung
returned and met up with Se Joon.

220
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,539
It appears that Se Joon

221
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,790
is going to try arranging for Rhee
Moon Sung to meet the Chairwoman.

222
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,789
Since Se Joon knows that
Rhee Moon Sung and I met,

223
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,769
it wouldn't be easy for him
to bring him to the house.

224
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,119
I think he's waiting for the right timing

225
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,940
for the Chairwoman and Rhee
Moon Sung to meet in private.

226
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,629
Let's try to stop it to
the best of our ability.

227
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,159
Will we be able to prevent it to the end?

228
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
Well, that'll probably be difficult.

229
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,689
Well,

230
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,089
if we can't stop it,

231
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,110
why don't we tell her first?

232
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,290
For Grandmother,

233
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,339
and for us as well.

234
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,600
No. Now's not the time.

235
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,389
I need to meet with him first.

236
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,639
Who?

237
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,469
Rhee Moon Sung.

238
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,980
What?

239
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,750
How?

240
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,250
Co-sister-in-law, you're not in bed yet?

241
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,489
Co-sister-in-law.

242
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,179
Is something the matter?

243
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,880
What's wrong?

244
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,789
Did you hear the news, by chance?

245
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,029
What?

246
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,469
Grandmother said

247
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,849
she'll be staying at the
hotel for the time being.

248
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,599
You didn't hear the news?

249
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,460
Oh, really?

250
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,359
She said her days to go to
the hotel are dwindling,

251
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,539
and that she wants to

252
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,930
spend her last moments at
the hotel that she's built.

253
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,370
Honey.

254
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,600
Grandmother says she will be staying
at the hotel for the time being.

255
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,079
What do you mean?

256
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,989
She doesn't have that much time left.

257
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,530
It seems like she wants to go to the hotel
for one last time while she still can.

258
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,179
Because I can understand how she feels,

259
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,540
I feel even worse...

260
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,240
So, Honey, you should go and
hold her hand once, okay?

261
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,770
Honey.

262
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,870
You're really going to regret it.

263
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,620
Gosh, you're so mean...

264
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,460
Let's go.

265
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,759
We've confirmed the check-in under
the Chairwoman's name for today.

266
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,140
Thank you.

267
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,679
Grandmother, it's Se Joon.

268
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,480
I have something to tell you.

269
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,049
You...

270
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,319
Why are you...?

271
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,860
Surprised, huh?

272
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,000
Will you stand out there?

273
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,310
Come inside. Let's talk inside.

274
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,650
Why are you in the room checked
in under Grandmother's name?

275
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,569
I could check in under Grandmother's name.

276
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,259
What about Grandmother?

277
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,960
Where is Grandmother?

278
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,379
Yoon Hee, tell Ji Won unni in passing
that Grandmother will be staying

279
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,479
at the hotel for the time being.

280
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,460
What?

281
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:01,059
Then Se Joon oppa will find out about that.

282
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,000
- Okay.
- And Moon Sung...

283
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,460
Jae Heon,

284
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,059
make some final good memories with
Grandmother as Rhee Moon Sung.

285
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,780
Good memories?

286
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,989
Grandmother, tell me
wherever you want to go.

287
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,799
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

288
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,610
Isn't it great to go on a trip like this?

289
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,779
Why did you decide

290
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,589
to go on a trip all of a sudden?

291
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,469
I thought about it

292
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,889
and realized when would we get to spend
some cozy time together, just you and me?

293
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,589
I felt like it might get more
difficult as time passes.

294
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,469
So, that's why I kidnapped
you today, Grandmother.

295
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm happy with it.

296
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,460
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

297
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,319
Also, the thing about trips is

298
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,199
you should get some fresh air
like this and do some sightseeing.

299
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,409
That way, life would be more
enjoyable, don't you think?

300
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,909
You're so good at talking.

301
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,559
So, did you decide where we're going?

302
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,999
I heard that you can see the
North from Paju or Ganghwa-do,

303
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,590
so I was thinking of going
somewhere in that area.

304
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,320
Forget it.

305
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,849
Excuse me?

306
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,910
There's nothing for me to
wait for from the North.

307
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,819
I'm not waiting anymore,

308
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,300
so there's no reason for
me to go there, either.

309
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,450
I don't want to go there.

310
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,499
I see...

311
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,160
Then, where do you want to go?

312
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,600
South.

313
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,940
- S-South?
- Yeah.

314
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,410
Let's go south.

315
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,629
Now that I think about it,

316
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,829
I don't think I've ever gone
on a proper trip before.

317
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,159
All I did was work.

318
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,050
It appears I've devoted my
entire life to Nakwon Hotel.

319
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,679
Do you regret it?

320
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,410
No.

321
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,899
I don't regret it, but

322
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,529
people are funny like that.

323
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,389
It does feel a bit hollow.

324
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,109
It's possible to feel sad
about paths not taken.

325
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,360
Paths not taken?

326
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,879
Raising children

327
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,610
and spending time with them...

328
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,049
Waiting for my husband to come home from
work and preparing dinner for him...

329
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,460
A life like that, I suppose.

330
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,139
Come on, Grandmother.

331
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,310
Nowadays, even the women in the
North don't live like that anymore.

332
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,750
I mean it.

333
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,710
All right.

334
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,850
Let's go south.

335
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,079
I want to go down a path
that I haven't gone before.

336
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,189
Then can we go somewhere
south that I want to go to?

337
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,849
Okay.

338
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,629
Wherever?

339
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,230
Wherever it is, I'm good.

340
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,070
Grandmother isn't here.

341
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,890
Mr. Rhee Moon Sung?

342
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,590
Before you ask, it's polite
to introduce yourself first.

343
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,760
I can't get used to this.

344
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,799
I'm Park Se Yeon.

345
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,309
I suppose I would be your noona?

346
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,450
You're my noona...

347
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,900
You want me to call you noona?

348
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,530
No.

349
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,059
I jumped over many hurdles, so
I can meet you like this today.

350
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,760
Tell me.

351
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,839
He is Rhee Moon Sung.

352
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,350
I'm sure.

353
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,439
Mr. Rhee Moon Sung.

354
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,960
I'll cut to the chase.

355
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,890
Please leave.

356
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,969
I'm sorry I must say this
to you, Mr. Moon Sung,

357
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,789
but for you to appear before
Grandmother right now...

358
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,899
It's too dangerous.

359
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,579
Of course, it's no fault of yours.

360
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,399
But...

361
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,960
if you care about Grandmother,

362
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,400
please pretend you don't
know anything and leave.

363
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,010
Grandmother won't last very long.

364
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,239
If we guarantee your rights,

365
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,060
you should be able to receive
a portion of the inheritance.

366
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,299
In the end, isn't what you want

367
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,559
money?

368
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,200
Money...

369
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,150
I think you're misunderstanding
something, so let me tell you.

370
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,120
I want Grandmother to feel pain.

371
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,610
You guys who lived such fancy and
extravagant lives wouldn't understand.

372
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,870
I want to...

373
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,579
return even a small fraction of the pain

374
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,000
that my family went through.

375
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,540
You understand?

376
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,329
Moon Sung.

377
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,499
Where are we?

378
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,419
I found this place while I
was traveling with Jin Sook.

379
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,889
It kind of gives the feel of
a neighborhood in the North.

380
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,129
Doesn't it give off a people-friendly feel?

381
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,749
I thought you might like
it, so I stopped by here.

382
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,420
Thank you.

383
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,450
They're jumping rope.

384
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,180
Grandmother, isn't it really pretty here?

385
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,899
Whoa!

386
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,250
I think you're even prettier!

387
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,680
Wait a sec.

388
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,380
One, two, three!

389
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,179
- Moon Sung.
- Yes, Grandmother.

390
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,399
I've waited a long time

391
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,700
for you and your father.

392
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,059
I was too late in coming.

393
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,379
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

394
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,550
That's not what I'm trying to say.

395
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,159
Since it was a place that I couldn't go to,

396
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,729
I automatically hoped for
you guys to come to me.

397
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,749
But...

398
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,739
I never thought about how you guys also

399
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,889
would have waited for me to come.

400
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,669
That thought never crossed my mind.

401
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,950
You and your father were waiting for me.

402
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,950
It appears we've just been
waiting for each other.

403
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,929
Including this place,

404
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,229
all the places that you've taken me

405
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,429
supposedly remind you of
where you used to live,

406
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,200
so I started imagining...

407
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,319
how you might have

408
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,189
spent your youth,

409
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,919
and what warmhearted people you met

410
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,190
that you, too, grew up so warmhearted.

411
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,299
Somehow,

412
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,589
it felt like I had entered

413
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,110
where you guys lived,

414
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,440
so that makes me happy.

415
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm sorry.

416
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,260
Come on, Grandmother.

417
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,490
Don't say things like that.

418
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,600
GM?

419
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,680
GM?

420
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,869
Oh, yes.

421
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,879
We're done arranging the hall.

422
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,219
For what?

423
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,650
Oh, it's a meeting about your wedding, GM.

424
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,679
Oh, right.

425
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm so forgetful.

426
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,049
Could you push back the meeting for me?

427
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,240
Excuse me?

428
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,370
Gosh.

429
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,259
Why is this sofa so cozy today?

430
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,140
It keeps pulling me in...

431
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,400
Gosh, I don't want to get up.

432
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900
All right.

433
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,740
I'm so tired.

434
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,190
(Moon Sung)

435
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,099
Yeah, Jae Heon.

436
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,670
Where are you?

437
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,269
Hey, where are we now?

438
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,869
Grandmother, this here

439
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,599
is a world-famous yacht-

440
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,539
yachting center.

441
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,699
- Yacht?
- Yes.

442
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,689
Then, one of mine should
be here somewhere, too.

443
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,909
What!

444
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,789
Is it this one?

445
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,309
- What, really?
- Yeah.

446
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,729
- What...
- Try looking for it.

447
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,629
Wait, then...

448
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,849
is it this one?

449
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,980
Yeah, it seems like it.

450
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,709
Wow...

451
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,549
This yacht is yours, Grandmother?

452
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,090
I'm just joking!

453
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,519
It's fun to tease my Moon Sung like this.

454
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,289
Come on!

455
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,320
I really thought that was for real.

456
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,299
Grandmother!

457
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,859
Hey, who is that?

458
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,489
Grandmother!

459
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,170
Isn't that Se Yeon?

460
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,439
Grandmother.

461
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,660
Look over there.

462
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,249
Grandmother!

463
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,559
What is she doing here?

464
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,990
Huh?

465
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,469
Cheers!

466
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,490
Grandmother, let's only
go through the motions.

467
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,279
Hey, how did you manage
to come here, Se Yeon?

468
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,159
I came because I wanted
to see you, Grandmother.

469
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,139
It's really nice here.

470
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,580
Yeah, it's really nice.

471
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,939
Se Yeon.

472
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,419
Yes.

473
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,769
You look just like me when I was younger.

474
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,899
If I was born in this generation,

475
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,239
I would look just like you.

476
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,049
Come on, Grandmother.

477
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,310
You probably wouldn't
be this pretty like me.

478
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,579
I'm sure I'd be prettier, not worse.

479
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,079
Hey, if you keep this up, you'll
fuel my competitive spirit.

480
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,839
You know, Grandmother?

481
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,040
Noona, it would be good
for you to stop here.

482
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,840
I mean, you are pretty.
You're pretty, but...

483
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,610
It's quite fascinating.

484
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,949
What do you mean?

485
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,599
He looks...

486
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,109
exactly like Young Hoon's father, whom
I got separated from in the North.

487
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,159
Oh. I see!

488
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,979
Grandfather?

489
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,750
Oh, really?

490
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,729
Seeing you two sitting
side by side like this...

491
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,440
This, too, is quite fascinating.

492
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,890
It reminds me of the old days.

493
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:59,059
Although it's so far in the past

494
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,940
to call it the old days...

495
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,980
Are you okay, Grandmother?

496
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,820
Gosh, damn it.

497
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,919
Whoa, you scared me!

498
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,939
Oh, you're here?

499
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,369
Oh, no. It's not like that.

500
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,489
Hey,

501
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,369
he says...

502
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,589
he put your father's birthday
as the passcode for the lock.

503
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,649
So, I was kind of curious about
when your father's birthday was...

504
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,200
Try opening it.

505
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,739
Your father's birthday.

506
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,710
Birthday...

507
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,629
Aigoo! Wow!

508
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,649
It was true!

509
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,239
Gosh, Sang Cheol hyung, this guy...

510
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,759
He doesn't look that way, but
he's quite detail-oriented.

511
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,779
The fact that he decided to put

512
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,619
the birthday of someone who passed away

513
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,439
means this money isn't from
me but from your father.

514
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,279
And so...

515
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,509
you have the right to receive this
money as a member of this family.

516
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,929
It carries that sort of meaning.

517
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,999
Hey,

518
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,960
let's open it and check what's inside.

519
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,349
Also,

520
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,479
although she couldn't hold a
memorial service for your father

521
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,419
because she didn't know when he passed,

522
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,409
but the Chairwoman personally made

523
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,819
seaweed soup every year on his birthday

524
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,109
and put it on the table,

525
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,100
so everyone in the family
knows his birthday.

526
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,509
You sure you don't want to try opening it?

527
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,609
Come on, try opening it.

528
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,250
I'm not interested.

529
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,310
Moon Sung.

530
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,999
Hey!

531
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,329
Gosh, it wouldn't have made a dent
even if I took a bundle from it.

532
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,060
This guy is so meticulous.

533
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,949
Hey, hold onto that liver.

534
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,280
He'll give me a call soon.

535
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah.

536
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,520
All right.

537
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,129
What are you doing?

538
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,699
Are you sure you got a liver that's
suitable for Comrade Jin Sook?

539
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,739
Of course! Did you ever see me lie?

540
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,270
Loosen this!

541
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,740
Is it also true we can get
surgery if we have the money?

542
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,099
Read it!

543
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,449
(To Moon Sung)
Read it!

544
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,120
Don't you even recognize
your wife's handwriting?

545
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,330
Rhee Moon Sung, I see you're back.

546
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,549
If you make sure she undergoes
surgery and recovers well,

547
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,570
you can have the rest of the money.

548
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,969
- What?
- If you'll take off with the money,

549
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,040
remember this neck rope.

550
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,680
When I go back and confirm
that Comrade Jin Sook is well,

551
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,400
I'll give you this much more.

552
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,150
Really?

553
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,569
(To my only star...)

554
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,839
To my only star,

555
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,869
Comrade Moon Sung.

556
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,929
They say that for those
whose lives are arduous,

557
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,199
your body is your wealth,

558
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,009
and your health is the
promise of the future.

559
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,210
But I have become your wife

560
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,079
with such a weak body.

561
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,730
So I am so sorry.

562
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,659
I've cried so many nights

563
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,599
whenever I saw you leaving

564
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,359
to take on all sorts of vicious jobs

565
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,010
because of me.

566
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,119
Whenever that happened,

567
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,599
I prayed to God

568
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,909
I've never seen.

569
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,699
Either restore my health,

570
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,879
or take me away quickly

571
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,260
so that you could be free from your burden.

572
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:57,309
I feel like it's such a relief
that you've gotten a chance

573
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,700
to see your Grandmother.

574
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,109
Since I've never been
able to properly tell you,

575
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,099
I write this letter

576
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,930
to express my feelings.

577
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,750
I love you.

578
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,679
Grandmother.

579
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,319
What do you think of the southern sea?

580
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,369
It seems...

581
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,550
the sea is just the sea.

582
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,370
Now that I look at it,

583
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,020
it's just the sea.

584
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,109
It turns out that

585
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,640
I was looking at it with a different heart.

586
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,210
Grandmother!

587
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,809
Grandmother.

588
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,760
Stay here for just a moment.

589
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,229
Noona, I won't drag this on.

590
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,020
For today, I'm not Yoo Jae Heon,

591
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,039
but I am Rhee Moon Sung.

592
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,780
So, for today...

593
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,510
it would be good if you could treat me

594
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,870
as the cousin you like, Rhee Moon Sung.

595
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,689
Okay.

Where did you come from?

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,210
Your appearance is beyond words...

heading down from Manchuria,

613

but I took a detour to visit my
hometown since it's been so long,

614
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,640
but then it got dark.

I just...

00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,480
entered the first house

Manchuria...

618

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,419
Yes.

650
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,979
♫ Because the love remains ♫

651
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:47,049
♫ When we separate,
leave with words unsaid ♫

652
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:55,050
♫ For the next time,
the next time for sure ♫

653
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,769
♫ Because it felt like we'd meet someday ♫

654
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:10,790
♫ Because it felt like
I shouldn't forget it ♫

655
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,769
Grandmother, where should we go now?

656
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,300
Grandmother, Se Yeon noona
bought coffee for us.

657
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,030
Grandmother.

658
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,300
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother?

659
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,329
Grandmother!

660
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,259
- Grandmother!
- Grandmother!

661
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,879
Grandmother!

662
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,499
Grandmother!

663
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,289
- Grandmother!
- Grandmother!

664
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,670
- Grandmother!
- Grandmother!

665
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,730
She's stabilized.

666
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,739
Really? That's a relief...

667
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,220
What do you mean, that's a relief?

668
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,759
What's a relief?

669
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,750
Excuse me?

670
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:26,249
When I said that, I meant she's past the critical
point where she could pass away at any moment.

671
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,370
Nothing's changed.

672
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,489
Then...

673
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,119
Grandmother is...

674
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,459
It's already been a while since
it's spread into her bones.

675
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,459
It wouldn't be strange if she
were to pass away right now.

676
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,669
She's managed to get
past the critical point

677
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,190
but it'd be good to prepare
yourselves to let her go.

678
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,159
Until the Chairwoman regains consciousness,

679
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,700
try to avoid visiting her.

680
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,410
I'm sorry, Noona.

681
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,510
About what?

682
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,899
I feel like

683
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,840
Grandmother pushed herself
too much because of me.

684
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,280
It really sunk in

685
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
while the doctor was speaking.

686
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,200
She must have been in so much pain,

687
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,540
but because she looked so happy,

688
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,750
I wasn't able to pick up on it.

689
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,640
It's not your fault.

690
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,640
Ever since you came,

691
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:04,089
Grandmother's been happy.

692
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,980
Her laughter

693
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,420
was like the sound of music to my ears.

694
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,210
I guess that's why I couldn't
end this performance, either.

695
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,210
The end I knew was approaching,

696
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,670
but it's an end I can't prevent

697
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,970
even though I prepared for it.

698
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,710
It hurts.

699
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,969
What happened?

700
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,889
The doctor says she's managed
to pass the critical point,

701
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,590
but she's not in a state where
we can let down our guard.

702
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,649
Ahjussi!

703
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,199
Grandmother's okay, right?

704
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,209
She's okay, right?

705
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,269
Yeah. Our Grandmother is
not just any grandmother.

706
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,429
There's no way. Fighting, Grandmother.

707
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,290
There's no way...

708
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,579
- Oppa!
- Get up, you asshole.

709
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,100
Get up!

710
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,759
Why are you suddenly acting up like that!

711
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,059
- Let go of me.
- It happened while on a trip to make her happy.

712
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,169
Is that his fault?

713
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,289
I told you to let go of me!

714
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,699
Why are you acting like
this between brothers?

715
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,839
Hey!

716
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,279
Brothers! Yeah?

717
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,680
He's our brother?

718
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,619
Come on, stop it!

719
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,680
Go ahead and say it with
your own lips! Do it!

720
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,070
Se Joon.

721
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,370
Let's stop this.

722
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,340
Let's go.

723
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,489
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

724
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,879
He was weird from the start.

725
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,379
From the very start!

726
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,510
- I should've gotten rid of him sooner-
- Stop it!

727
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,179
Grandmother hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

728
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,120
Stop making a commotion here.
Let's go home and talk!

729
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,060
It won't be good if it gets infected.
Let me see it just once.

730
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,110
Forget it.

731
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,770
Doesn't it hurt?

732
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,419
It hurts.

733
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,439
It'll hurt even more tomorrow...

734
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,410
I want to hurt.

735
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,530
It's better that my lip hurts.

736
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,320
Just let me be.

737
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,820
I'm scared.

738
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,850
The fact that we need to
reveal the truth to everyone

739
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,030
feels like I've become a witch
having to stand before trial.

740
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,390
Will Grandmother...

741
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,900
