1
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,238
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,039
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,371
How about it?

4
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,371
You ready to go in?

5
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:54,705
Or should I say,
"You're taking back your place"?

6
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:02,438
This tastes so good that I have to ask:

7
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,638
Can you make Pyeongyang naengmyeon too?

8
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,939
Naengmyeon, you ask?

9
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,005
Yes.

10
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:12,705
Grandma and I like that dish.
So does my wife.

11
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:17,371
Yeah, Pyeong-naeng is the best.

12
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,605
I crave that unique taste once in a while.

13
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,305
But do you really know how to make it?

14
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,338
Of course I do. Indeed.

15
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,371
-Is that true?
-Yeah. It's nothing, really.

16
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,872
Well, it's not a difficult dish to make,

17
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,638
but I need to make hand-pulled noodles.

18
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:41,472
Plus, we have to make the broth
and let it cool.

19
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,939
It's a time-consuming process.

20
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,072
But if you want,

21
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,305
I'll make time to cook it for you.

22
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,505
Oh, my. That sounds awesome.

23
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:57,371
Indeed, I'd love for you to cook it for us
when you have some time.

24
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,005
Yes, of course.

25
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:02,705
We owe it to Moon-seong
for adding another menu item at home.

26
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,005
JANG TAE-JU

27
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:16,039
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

28
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:18,905
That's fine. Don't worry. Take the call.

29
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,338
He never takes calls during family meals.

30
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:32,238
I guess it's a really important call.

31
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,872
It's too early for a phone call.

32
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,371
Are you home?

33
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:45,039
-I am.
-We're standing at the front door.

34
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,039
May we come in?

35
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:06,505
How dare you come here without a word?

36
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,905
They say, "Make hay while the sun shines."

37
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:13,039
Now that there's proof he's your family,
let's finish this.

38
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,072
This problem won't resolve itself
with recklessness.

39
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:18,505
But I must see my grandma.

40
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:22,538
Does it have to be today?

41
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,772
It took you 20 years to get here,
so what's a couple more days?

42
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,538
Wow. You're so frustrating.

43
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:35,171
He takes back his place,
and I get what I deserve.

44
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:39,572
Let's hurry up, clean up this mess,
and never see each other again.

45
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,438
For now, wait at my office.
I'll be there soon.

46
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,271
The food is getting cold.
Did you meet someone?

47
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,271
-Huh?
-Weren't you out just now?

48
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:09,772
No.

49
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,238
I didn't want you to hear me
if I spoke too loudly.

50
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:17,738
I didn't want to disturb your meal.
Let's keep eating.

51
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,605
What's wrong?
You look like you're out of it.

52
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,572
Hey, Comrade Ri Moon-seong.

53
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:48,338
-Hey, get it together.
-Wait. Be quiet.

54
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:49,738
What's going on?

55
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,939
Man, what was that?

56
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,972
Something is off, but I don't know what.

57
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,105
Hey, this is code red.

58
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,072
Code red?

59
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,405
Listen, Mr. Jeong.

60
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:20,039
In theater studies, there's something
called the character consistency rule.

61
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:26,105
So far, the dangerous dude has gone good,
and the nice dude--

62
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,839
No, the nice sister has gone strange.

63
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,138
So what are you saying?

64
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:37,072
So I'm saying, these characters
have lost consistency and have changed.

65
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,705
I mean Se-jun and Se-yeon.

66
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:43,405
Mr. Jeong, changes like these,

67
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:49,538
they never happen
without a specific reason.

68
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,039
It's absolutely impossible.

69
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:56,371
The way I see it,
there's a significant reason

70
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,805
for their change in attitude.

71
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,405
What might that be?

72
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,072
Maybe…

73
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,371
we've been found out.

74
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,972
You think our cover's blown?

75
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,872
Yoon-hee, you were there.

76
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,105
People don't change so easily.

77
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,039
Think about the difference

78
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,638
between the atmosphere
on our first day and today.

79
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:31,705
Think about it.

80
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,138
Okay, Moon-seong,

81
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,171
I want…

82
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,138
you to live with us.

83
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:43,271
You came all the way here.
I want to do everything I can for you.

84
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:46,072
How were you able
to come down to the South?

85
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,338
Still, I can't believe it's that simple
to defect from the North.

86
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:53,105
Weren't you interviewed by NIS?

87
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,705
-It did feel weird.
-Right?

88
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,572
See?
Those details shouldn't be overlooked.

89
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:01,738
Also…

90
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,371
the real Ri Moon-seong's return.

91
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:11,538
Mr. Jeong, movies and TV series

92
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,605
use this to foreshadow endings.

93
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:19,505
It's somewhat like a bomb
that triggers the plot to the climax.

94
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:25,538
And Ri Moon-seong's sudden arrival
is the biggest problem.

95
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,572
Honey, take your phone with you.

96
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:34,738
Right.

97
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:40,105
You never forget things. What's wrong?
Did something happen?

98
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,939
No. I'll see you later.

99
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:32,505
Why exactly do you need more time?

100
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,338
Aren't you eager to get things moving?

101
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,905
How much longer will you allow
that impostor to keep pretending?

102
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:40,305
The problem

103
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,438
is that my grandmother believes
that the impostor is real.

104
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,905
That's why we need to expose him.

105
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,939
My grandmother isn't well.

106
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,505
If we just tell her,
"Your grandson is an impostor.

107
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:58,371
Your real grandson is this fellow"…

108
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,572
I may be a calculating man,

109
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:07,138
but I can't begin to fathom
how shocked she'll be.

110
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,072
I want to do away with the hotel,
not my grandmother.

111
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,271
Okay, then, what do you suggest we do?

112
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,872
First, Moon-seong--

113
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,238
or that impostor--

114
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,839
I'm going to expose him.

115
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,805
Then I'll tell the truth
when I feel that my family,

116
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:29,538
especially my grandmother,
is ready to hear the truth.

117
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,171
It won't take long.

118
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,772
Why is that necessary?

119
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:42,338
Families are peculiar like that.

120
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,072
Even if you hate them to death,

121
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:49,572
they're the first you call in hardship.

122
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,538
Sometimes they feel like strangers,

123
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:57,305
but then they'll be at your side
like you've always been inseparable.

124
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:02,472
Maybe it's affection, maybe love,

125
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:06,572
but they make things complicated
and cause confusion.

126
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,572
Isn't that what a family is?

127
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:18,039
Your feelings about Grandma
must be nothing less than simple.

128
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,305
But that's family.

129
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,505
But those punks are impostors.

130
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,738
They can't possibly have complicated
or confused sentiments.

131
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,905
They're treating my family
with wholehearted love and affection.

132
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:35,638
Being an impostor probably helped them
in that respect.

133
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:41,972
That's what makes this trickier:
because everyone loves them.

134
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:49,438
Give me some time
to discredit their sweet affection.

135
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:08,238
There's one thing I learned
from observing my father:

136
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,672
The truth hurts, you know?

137
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,772
But your family?

138
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:24,605
I wonder if you all will be able
to accept the truth.

139
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,638
Tae-ju, Tae-ju.

140
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,005
Mr. Park, how may I help you?

141
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,039
It's been a while.

142
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,305
You never call without a reason.

143
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,872
You have something I can write about?
Some interesting news?

144
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:33,605
It's a family matter.

145
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,638
The hotel sale? The inheritance?

146
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:38,638
What? What is it? Tell me.

147
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,105
I have a little brother.

148
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,905
Park Se-gyu? Who doesn't know that?

149
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:47,972
No, not him. I have another brother.

150
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,805
His name is Ri Moon-seong.

151
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:55,972
Give me details.

152
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,805
You dig up the rest

153
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,705
by asking Park Se-yeon.

154
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:02,839
Why can't you tell me yourself?

155
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:08,205
Wait. So those are your terms?

156
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,605
That I interview her?

157
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,205
I like how quick you are.

158
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,605
Is it an exclusive?

159
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:16,505
Only if you don't tell anyone.

160
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:31,171
Why didn't you retaliate?

161
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,839
I thought you'd be one
to bulldoze your way in.

162
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:43,271
I mean, I see why that wouldn't be
the sensible thing to do.

163
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,472
He's right.

164
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:54,438
Families are complicated.

165
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,438
I'm actually not sure

166
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,072
what I should do.

167
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:05,005
What's that, now?

168
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,839
You went through all kinds of shit
to get here.

169
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,939
You'll get your due, so don't worry.

170
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:15,005
All right.

171
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,338
As long as I get what I asked for.

172
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,672
Sang-cheol, what brings you here?

173
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,271
What? Am I not allowed to visit?

174
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:39,039
No, that's not--

175
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,238
I'll explain everything, so…

176
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,205
Who are you?

177
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:50,072
Yeah, so the thing is--

178
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:53,905
Right. I see.
You're this hunting dog's owner.

179
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,839
We haven't met. My name is Ri Moon-seong.

180
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:07,572
I know very well who you are,

181
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:11,839
although this isn't an ideal way to meet.

182
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:16,072
I guess I have him to thank,
now that I'm talking to you face to face.

183
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:19,672
Do me one favor.

184
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,238
Can you return home?

185
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:28,438
That's not possible.

186
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:31,305
If that's the case,

187
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:34,605
for as long as the chairwoman lives,

188
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,572
make yourself scarce.

189
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,972
That would also be impossible.

190
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,605
I'll vouch for your inheritance rights
after the chairwoman passes.

191
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,405
The grandson she needs right now

192
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:50,772
is someone who is kind,

193
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:53,939
untainted and harmless.

194
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,305
Stop talking bullshit.

195
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,505
A grandson who's rough,

196
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:11,371
violent, and always resentful of others,

197
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,872
crawling in the sewers
without the desire to get out--

198
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,738
Such nuisance isn't what she needs.

199
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,605
You fucking bastard!

200
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:28,005
Sang-cheol, let's talk about this, yeah?

201
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,205
I beg you.

202
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,939
Please go back.

203
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,572
I won't forget this.

204
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,271
Tae-ju.

205
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:21,005
This isn't your decision to make!

206
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,638
This is their family affair!

207
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:27,305
They get to decide what to do
with the truth, no matter what it is!

208
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,872
I'm not saying what I did was right.

209
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:41,171
From now on, call me right away
whenever Se-jun calls you

210
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:45,972
and as soon as you know
where Ri Moon-seong is.

211
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,338
Are you telling me to be
a double agent right now?

212
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,972
Yes. You're the best at that shit.

213
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,338
Oh, man…

214
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:01,872
Damn it.

215
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:18,405
I'm serious, Grandma.

216
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:21,538
These days, in the North,

217
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:27,072
we have local markets that are open,
like a farmer's market.

218
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:31,605
You have soap operas in the South, right?

219
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:35,005
You can watch them at the market
because they set it up like this--

220
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,505
-Ma'am.
-Pirate--

221
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,438
I'm back.

222
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,171
Welcome back, Mr. Jeong.

223
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:42,005
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

224
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:57,039
-Keep going.
-Okay.

225
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,939
We haven't met. My name is Ri Moon-seong.

226
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:55,605
Grandma, it's getting chilly now.
Should we go inside?

227
00:19:57,872 --> 00:19:59,005
Should we?

228
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,205
Let's go.

229
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:27,005
I'm good now. You can go.

230
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,805
Grandma, you're okay, right?

231
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:30,905
I told you I'm fine.

232
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:38,371
Why do you always take me to my room
when we see each other every day?

233
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,171
I'm not a child.

234
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:44,472
Grandma,
let's see each other tomorrow too.

235
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,672
My goodness.

236
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:50,072
All of you are always so worried.

237
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:54,138
Why do you burden yourself
with so much worry when you're so young?

238
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:57,839
Hey, stop saying such silly things
and go rest.

239
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:00,205
See you tomorrow.

240
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,805
Good night, Grandma.

241
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:29,805
I…

242
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:35,505
I don't know for how much longer
I can live as Ri Moon-seong.

243
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:43,472
I never know…

244
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:50,605
when the last time will be that
I'll be able to take you to your room.

245
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:58,305
That's what I'm afraid of.

246
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:35,905
Damn it.

247
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,672
-The person you're calling--
-Damn it.

248
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,538
This is driving me nuts. That damn punk!

249
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:01,605
Se-yeon.

250
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:04,705
Mr. Jeong.

251
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:07,305
Are you going somewhere
at this time of night?

252
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:09,472
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

253
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:12,438
May I drive you?

254
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:15,171
That's okay. I want to be alone.

255
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:10,371
We're exposed?

256
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,905
I confirmed that Se-jun met Ri Moon-seong.

257
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:15,472
My gosh.

258
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:18,805
Then what should we do?

259
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:23,005
There must be a reason
why Se-jun is keeping his mouth shut

260
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,405
and why Ri Moon-seong
isn't showing up right now.

261
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:31,939
Even if our play fails,

262
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,772
it will all be my fault,

263
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:36,705
not yours.

264
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:40,505
And as promised, the money--

265
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:41,705
Mr. Jeong.

266
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,839
That's not the problem.

267
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:47,839
That money-- that isn't the issue.

268
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,805
Thank you both for your hard work.

269
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:55,972
I think it's time
that I tell Ms. Ja the truth now.

270
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:58,538
Thank you.

271
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:00,972
Wait.

272
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,138
Not yet.

273
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:07,271
Grandma doesn't know yet, right?

274
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:10,638
She doesn't know yet.

275
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:14,305
There must be something else we can try.

276
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:17,772
So not just yet.

277
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,472
First, I think we need to figure out
who knows what.

278
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:25,905
We need to know who else in the family
knows that we're impostors

279
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:29,271
and that Ri Moon-seong is here right now.

280
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:31,638
-We'll look into that.
-Yeah.

281
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,171
We should each do what we can.

282
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,772
We can tell the truth
after we try everything we can.

283
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,338
That's right.

284
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,438
Okay.

285
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,738
I understand.

286
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,205
If there is anything I can help with,

287
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:53,839
let me know right away.

288
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:05,638
Se-jun.

289
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,171
Drink this.

290
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,805
-Are you talking to me?
-Yeah.

291
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:27,338
Don't worry. I didn't poison it.

292
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,572
So who did you meet yesterday?

293
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,705
-What do you mean?
-You left in the morning.

294
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,738
I was taking an important call.

295
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,405
So who was it?

296
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:53,505
Shouldn't you be worrying about
other things right now?

297
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:58,371
-What does that mean?
-Do you think you've won our fight?

298
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:02,405
Or do you think you haven't lost yet?

299
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:07,572
You should think carefully
about what you have and don't have.

300
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:12,205
I don't think that's something
you should tell your opponent.

301
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:14,738
Do you think I'm going to lose?

302
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:18,039
Even if I warn you,
there is nothing you can do.

303
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:23,538
Because no matter what you do,
I have an irrefutable piece of truth.

304
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,572
Moon-seong, are you going to work now?

305
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:37,605
Yes.

306
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:41,538
-You're working at the laundry, right?
-Yes.

307
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:43,572
How is the work? You okay there?

308
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,205
I'm fine.

309
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:48,205
Being able to work gives me
the greatest joy in life.

310
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:50,039
Yes. Keep up the good work.

311
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,672
Then you'll move up to the lobby,
then the planning office.

312
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,472
Eventually, an executive.

313
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:57,638
Who knows?

314
00:27:57,705 --> 00:28:00,672
You may become responsible
for a hotel branch someday.

315
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:07,205
That day will never come.

316
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:11,572
Are you sure?

317
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:14,238
Yes.

318
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:17,305
I'm sure. That day will never come.

319
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,271
Okay. If you say so.

320
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,171
I'm off to work.

321
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:37,438
Moon-seong, do you want to go with me?

322
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,972
Sure.

323
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:47,872
Ji-won.

324
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:50,638
Oh, Jin-suk. Something the matter?

325
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:52,205
No, everything is fine.

326
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:56,405
By the way,

327
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,005
is something on Se-jun's mind?

328
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,405
Se-jun?

329
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,072
He always has a lot on his plate.

330
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,672
It'd be unusual for him not to. Why?

331
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:08,805
Well, it's just that

332
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:13,138
he looks like someone who hasn't eaten
for days, so I was worried.

333
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:14,438
Oh, really?

334
00:29:14,972 --> 00:29:19,338
You're right. He has been looking
especially worried lately.

335
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,738
-Really?
-Yeah.

336
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:25,572
But my husband has always been
so serious, even when we were dating.

337
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,939
This is all he does.

338
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:35,505
And his face is always grave like this.
He's so serious. He's just like that.

339
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:42,672
But he's not the one with the problem.
I am.

340
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,772
Is something bothering you?

341
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:50,072
Do you want to sneak out for some coffee?

342
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:53,105
Why would we sneak out?
We can just walk out.

343
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,171
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

344
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,438
Se-yeon.

345
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,105
Yes?

346
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,405
By any chance…

347
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,205
What is it?

348
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:20,872
It's nothing. Never mind.

349
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,171
-Moon-seong.
-Yes?

350
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:31,171
What do you think about
quitting your job at the hotel?

351
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,705
Sorry?

352
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,705
I've been thinking about it,

353
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:40,939
and I feel you don't have much time
to see Grandma because of work.

354
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:44,672
It's been years since you two last met,

355
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:48,205
and I feel my selfishness is taking
precious time away from you two.

356
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:56,839
My goodness. That's not true, Se-yeon.

357
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,405
Please don't think of it that way,
Se-yeon.

358
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,572
We can always meet whenever we'd like.

359
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,271
And you can start working at the hotel
again whenever you'd like.

360
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:13,738
But Grandma doesn't have
that much time left.

361
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,538
When I see how happy she looks
when she's with you,

362
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:24,472
I just hope that she can enjoy it
for a little longer.

363
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:29,271
Give it some thought.

364
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:44,939
-It's delicious.
-It's so good.

365
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:49,905
Jin-suk.

366
00:31:53,805 --> 00:31:55,538
Should I start working again?

367
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,805
You want to go back to work?

368
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,305
Well, it's just that…

369
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,039
I feel like I haven't been doing much
with my life.

370
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:11,371
-Did you like your old job?
-No, not really.

371
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,205
Working in the media is different
from what people think.

372
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:18,005
I really wanted it
before I started working.

373
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,405
But once I started, I hated it.

374
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,238
Then why are you thinking about
going back to work?

375
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:25,939
My friends treat me

376
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:30,705
like I'm spoiled and good for nothing
because I have a rich husband.

377
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:34,939
And I feel like my life is being defined

378
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,738
by who my husband is, not who I am.

379
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,972
Your friends are the problem.

380
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:43,939
There's an old saying
that a married couple is one body.

381
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,672
When the right arm is working,
the left arm can rest.

382
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:50,138
Why would you do something you hate
just because of what others think?

383
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:51,305
You think so?

384
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:55,305
I'll go teach them a lesson.
Don't stop me.

385
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,705
Thank you so much.

386
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,138
Don't mention it.

387
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:06,839
Even if I warn you,
there is nothing you can do.

388
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:11,638
Because no matter what you do,
I have an irrefutable piece of truth.

389
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:20,638
Ma'am.

390
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:22,905
Yes?

391
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,972
Haerang Daily is requesting an interview.

392
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,972
Decline respectfully.

393
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,472
Well, the problem is,

394
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,138
they want to do a piece
on Mr. Ri Moon-seong.

395
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:35,205
What?

396
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,238
You know that I'm always willing
to talk about the company.

397
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:47,772
But this is a private family matter.

398
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,872
Not sure about that.

399
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:53,271
Isn't Nakwon Hotel a family business, so
your family is also part of the company?

400
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:55,705
Se-gyu would be hurt if he heard that.

401
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,305
He would boldly claim
that he's an outsider at Nakwon.

402
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:02,005
Then is Mr. Ri an insider at Nakwon?

403
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,105
I heard he works here.

404
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:10,271
Who told you that?

405
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:14,039
You know I can't reveal my source.

406
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:16,772
-The ethics of journalism--
-Someone throws you a bone,

407
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:19,972
and you jump at it
and start digging into the matter.

408
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,939
That doesn't seem so ethical.

409
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:26,672
Is there a reason
why you're trying so hard

410
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:29,371
to keep Mr. Ri hidden from the public eye?

411
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:33,171
Is there something that
you don't want the public to know?

412
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,138
-Sir--
-Out of nowhere,

413
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,605
the grandson of a famous chairwoman
of a big company appears.

414
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:42,338
Someone will do a story on this,

415
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:45,205
and an article will be published
one way or another.

416
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:50,705
Wouldn't it be better
if you control the narrative?

417
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:57,472
I would be very interested
in writing that article myself.

418
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:13,839
Se-yeon, if you're not busy,
do you want to have dinner with me?

419
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:18,105
Should we eat together?
Would you like to dine with me?

420
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:21,171
Se-yeon,
do you want to have dinner with me?

421
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:24,238
Want to eat with me?

422
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:26,805
Do you want to…

423
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:32,638
Why am I suddenly so nervous?

424
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,705
It's no big deal.

425
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:44,839
Knock, knock.

426
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:48,738
Se-yeon.

427
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:51,271
-Are you done with work?
-Yes.

428
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,939
You haven't eaten yet, right?

429
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:58,705
Then…

430
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,171
Se-yeon,

431
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,538
do you want to have dinner with me?

432
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,572
My goodness.

433
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:17,572
That felt awkward.

434
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,605
What would you like to eat?

435
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,138
Oh, well,

436
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:28,438
just…

437
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,105
coffee… and ramyeon?

438
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,438
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can eat with you today.

439
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:42,305
I already have plans.

440
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,105
You have plans?

441
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:50,638
BAE DONG-JAE

442
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,438
Hey.

443
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,705
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

444
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:03,872
I can't believe you made
a restaurant reservation for me.

445
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:08,572
You said you always eat in your room.
Aren't you sick of that?

446
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,238
You're one to talk.

447
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:13,305
You probably had the food here
more than a hundred times.

448
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,672
It's good every time.

449
00:37:16,072 --> 00:37:17,105
It is good.

450
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,405
What do you want?

451
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:25,171
Am I finally worth something to you?

452
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:27,505
Is that it?

453
00:37:33,105 --> 00:37:35,472
Give me your shares of our hotel.

454
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,905
You know what my terms are.

455
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,572
Do you have to go that far?

456
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:47,605
I've never changed my terms.

457
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:51,138
More importantly, I'm curious now.

458
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:55,772
You said just recently
you didn't need my shares.

459
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:01,305
What's making you hasty all of a sudden,
Se-yeon?

460
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,138
I'll consider your marriage proposal.

461
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:22,839
What?

462
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,505
Isn't that the answer you wanted?

463
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:42,572
It doesn't seem like
Ji-won knows anything.

464
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:44,872
What about you? Did you find out anything?

465
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:46,905
I need to keep looking.

466
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:48,371
Oh, right. By the way,

467
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,672
how is Se-yeon?

468
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:54,572
I don't know. She keeps avoiding me.

469
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:56,839
I need to talk to her
to figure out anything.

470
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:04,271
Goodness. In the end…

471
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:08,205
In the end, we're back where we started.

472
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:20,405
-You haven't gone home yet?
-I need to report something.

473
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:22,638
Mr. Park Se-jun withdrew his offer to buy

474
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:25,105
Nakwon Hotel's shares
from Ilseong Partners.

475
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:31,705
Thank you.

476
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:43,039
Se-jun is letting go of me,
and Se-yeon is partnering up with me.

477
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:46,638
What's going on?

478
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,305
Aren't you going to sleep?

479
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:03,672
I can't seem to fall asleep.

480
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:08,805
Worrying won't solve anything.

481
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,238
At times like this,
it's best to just sleep.

482
00:40:12,772 --> 00:40:14,472
Can't argue with that.

483
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:16,638
I totally agree.

484
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:19,638
Then hurry up and sleep.

485
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,171
But…

486
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,572
worrying…

487
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:33,138
Never mind. Good night.

488
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:46,472
I'm going for a walk.

489
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:48,805
Go ahead and sleep.

490
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:03,072
What am I doing?

491
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:30,872
What's this about,
meeting me at a place like this?

492
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,438
I needed to talk to you.

493
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,105
About the shares?

494
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:38,572
Yes.

495
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:42,271
I offered you ten times the price,
but you declined.

496
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:43,605
That's not the problem.

497
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:48,271
Now,
even if you offer them for half the price,

498
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:49,939
I don't want them.

499
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,839
Yes. That's the issue.

500
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:57,572
You always make calculated moves.

501
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:00,638
That's why I like you.
You're easy to read.

502
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,605
I just need to follow the profit.

503
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:05,805
So why would you suddenly
not need my shares?

504
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:09,305
I'm sure it wasn't a decision
based on your emotions.

505
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,138
What's going on?

506
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,205
What's changed, exactly?

507
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,872
Suddenly, you don't need my shares.

508
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,005
And now, Se-yeon is desperate enough
to consider marrying me.

509
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:23,638
She is?

510
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,638
Then… I guess Se-yeon knows too.

511
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:33,271
Knows what?

512
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:38,105
You're smart. Figure it out.

513
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:40,605
Think about what must've changed
for this to happen.

514
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,171
The reason why you needed my shares.

515
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:48,405
The reason why Se-yeon
didn't need my shares.

516
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:50,572
There's only one thing that makes sense:

517
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,738
your cousin, Ri Moon-seong.

518
00:43:54,905 --> 00:43:56,205
That's right.

519
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:58,772
Yes, but how can that change?

520
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,405
You're so frustrating.
You should think outside the box.

521
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:08,305
That's why I like you, though:
You're easy to read.

522
00:44:08,371 --> 00:44:09,972
Stop playing games with me.

523
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:16,738
He's an impostor.

524
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:19,271
He isn't Ri Moon-seong.

525
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:22,772
What?

526
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:26,738
The Ri Moon-seong you know
isn't my cousin.

527
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:33,338
-What are you talking about?
-You just said it yourself.

528
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:35,805
You can't think of any other reason,
can you?

529
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:39,638
Think about the situation
that's unfolding right now.

530
00:44:39,705 --> 00:44:43,005
Then you'll realize
that I'm telling the truth.

531
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:52,371
The cousin we thought was on Se-yeon's
side turned out to be an impostor.

532
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:56,371
The fake inheritor was never
going to receive those shares.

533
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,371
That's why I don't need your shares.
I already won this game.

534
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:02,805
That punk is an impostor?

535
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,171
Yes.

536
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:08,171
Why don't you mention this to Se-yeon?

537
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:11,772
Tell her that
you're transferring your shares to me.

538
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,271
Then she probably won't have a choice
but to marry you.

539
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:19,705
What?

540
00:45:20,905 --> 00:45:23,738
Isn't that what you wanted?

541
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:36,939
Just one minute. I just need one minute.

542
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:38,672
No, 30 seconds. Please?

543
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:42,238
You know Mr. Ri Moon-seong? Tell me
when he came and how he's related.

544
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,039
Anything you know would be helpful.

545
00:45:44,105 --> 00:45:48,205
I'm sorry, but our hotel regulations
forbid me from sharing that information.

546
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:49,805
Those damn regulations.

547
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,672
-What's going on?
-He said he's a reporter.

548
00:45:59,738 --> 00:46:01,638
He kept asking about Mr. Ri.

549
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,072
I just sent him away.

550
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:12,039
I'm a reporter from Haerang Daily.
Do you know Mr. Ri Moon-seong?

551
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,371
I'm sorry, but I don't know him.

552
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,472
Mr. Ri!

553
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:25,572
Yes?

554
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:28,805
You forgot this.

555
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,939
-Tower A, third floor.
-Okay.

556
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,872
So you're Ri Moon-seong.

557
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:49,939
My gosh.
I thought you were on your deathbed.

558
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:53,805
But you look so good.

559
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:56,405
Oh, stop it.

560
00:46:56,472 --> 00:46:59,171
You're still alive too. Don't be silly.

561
00:47:00,605 --> 00:47:01,905
How have you been?

562
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,005
I'm just getting by.

563
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,371
Hey. I can't believe we managed

564
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:13,972
to keep in touch after our first meeting
at the family reunion event.

565
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:18,005
There were about 50 of us
at the first event, right?

566
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:20,105
It was 52.

567
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,238
-Why are you leaving two out?
-Oh, right.

568
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:27,271
I'm next.

569
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,939
I'm leaving this life before you.

570
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,271
Live a long and happy life
before you join me.

571
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:35,705
It's like a raffle now.

572
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,305
We'll be there soon too.

573
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:40,271
We don't know

574
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:43,505
whether it'll be me or her
who'll be chosen first.

575
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:47,538
I heard your grandson is here.

576
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:48,805
Yes, that's right.

577
00:47:48,872 --> 00:47:51,538
That's great. That's really great.

578
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,472
The one regret I had in life is gone now,

579
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,505
so I can finally die in peace.

580
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:03,338
-You must really adore him.
-Of course.

581
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:08,238
He grew up in such a rough place,
but he turned out so well.

582
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,905
Just looking at him now
makes me feel grateful.

583
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:15,405
Ma'am.

584
00:48:19,338 --> 00:48:20,505
Oh, my goodness!

585
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:25,105
My gosh! I can't believe this.

586
00:48:25,638 --> 00:48:27,072
Look who it is.

587
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,338
Is that you, Cheol-jin?

588
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:30,438
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:33,039
My goodness!

590
00:48:40,405 --> 00:48:41,738
Cheol-jin!

591
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:06,638
I heard the news.

592
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:09,205
So you found your grandson.

593
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,238
Goodness. What a relief.

594
00:49:15,939 --> 00:49:19,905
I didn't know how I would ever repay
that debt I owed you.

595
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,839
But this news makes me feel…

596
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,505
a little better, ma'am.

597
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:30,772
No, don't apologize.

598
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:33,805
You grew up to become a fine judge.

599
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:38,839
I'm sure my late husband
would've been proud

600
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:42,939
to see you do so much for society.

601
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,738
I owe him my life.

602
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:49,338
Thank you so much, ma'am.

603
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:56,972
What is your grandson like?

604
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:01,405
He grew up to be a fine young man.

605
00:50:01,472 --> 00:50:03,438
Goodness. I'm envious.

606
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:08,039
-You're envious?
-I am.

607
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:12,072
Now that I have kids and grandkids,
I realize

608
00:50:12,872 --> 00:50:14,972
they never turn out the way you want.

609
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,405
Don't be silly.
You're too young to say that.

610
00:50:18,472 --> 00:50:23,005
My goodness, ma'am.
My granddaughter is 15 years old now.

611
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:26,638
Is she already?

612
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:27,805
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:30,972
Goodness.

614
00:50:32,472 --> 00:50:33,638
My goodness.

615
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:37,672
I can't get in contact with him.

616
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,271
He doesn't know anyone here,

617
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,605
so it's impossible to find him
if he's determined to stay hidden.

618
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:46,371
What about Se-jun?

619
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:49,538
No word yet.

620
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:52,405
He hasn't contacted me
since he told me to wait.

621
00:50:53,638 --> 00:50:56,338
Se-jun doesn't know
Ri Moon-seong disappeared yet, right?

622
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:59,538
No, because I haven't contacted him
since then either.

623
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:01,271
Tae-ju,

624
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:03,972
if you're lying again,

625
00:51:05,805 --> 00:51:06,805
I'm going to kill you.

626
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:11,538
Why would I lie to you
when you already know everything now?

627
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:15,171
If you hadn't beaten me up so badly,

628
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,705
I'd be out looking for him already.

629
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:22,138
Stop making excuses
and call me as soon as you find him.

630
00:51:22,972 --> 00:51:24,305
Yes, sir.

631
00:51:58,538 --> 00:52:01,371
This isn't your decision to make!

632
00:52:01,438 --> 00:52:03,505
This is their family affair!

633
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:07,205
They get to decide what to do
with the truth, no matter what it is!

634
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:22,939
There must be something else we can try.

635
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:26,605
So not just yet.

636
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:49,805
He's Mr. Ri, right?

637
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,939
Chairman Ja's grandson from the North.

638
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,205
You're still not going to do
the interview?

639
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:01,972
Mr. Jeong.

640
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:07,271
-Are you on your way to see Chairman Ja?
-Yes.

641
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:09,305
She went out.

642
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:13,672
She said there's a place
that she has to go alone.

643
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,438
By herself?

644
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:17,005
Yes.

645
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:20,005
I tried to stop her,
but she insisted on going.

646
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:23,505
I told her that I would call you,
but she stopped me.

647
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:25,405
Really?

648
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:48,605
Stay close to me, Geum-sun.

649
00:53:50,905 --> 00:53:52,872
Honey, hurry!

650
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,605
No!

651
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:05,638
Hang on tight!

652
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:06,772
Geum-sun!

653
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:08,438
Survive!

654
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:10,405
You must survive!

655
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:13,305
No!

656
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:18,171
Honey!

657
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,472
Honey! Yeong-hoon!

658
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,171
Yeong-hoon!

659
00:54:50,572 --> 00:54:51,572
Mother.

660
00:54:57,238 --> 00:54:58,572
Yeong-hoon.

661
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:02,572
Yeong-hoon.

662
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:07,338
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

663
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:13,039
It's been a long time.

664
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:33,572
Hey, Jae-heon!

665
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,472
Moon-seong, can I see you for a second?

666
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:44,338
I won.

667
00:55:46,505 --> 00:55:48,005
Have you heard the news?

668
00:55:50,005 --> 00:55:51,005
What news?

669
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:53,505
Apparently,
there's a reporter getting pretty nosy.

670
00:55:53,572 --> 00:55:55,705
-He's looking into Ri Moon-seong.
-What?

671
00:55:57,505 --> 00:55:58,805
He even took a photo.

672
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:01,105
He's really pestering Ms. Park right now.

673
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:02,905
-What?
-I'm serious.

674
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:09,039
Plus, we were ordered to not even utter
a word about you to anyone.

675
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:14,072
If you insist on staying silent,

676
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,438
I'll just have to write an article
with what I already have.

677
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:21,605
Special conglomerate story,
with that photo on the front page.

678
00:56:23,072 --> 00:56:26,972
Is it okay for a reporter to write
speculative articles like that?

679
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,905
I just need to change the period
to a question mark.

680
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:34,105
"The Prodigal Grandson of Nakwon Group?"
Something like that.

681
00:56:57,072 --> 00:56:59,438
May I have a seat?

682
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,972
What? You're getting married?

683
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:14,305
To Bae Dong-jae,
the heir of Wooseong Group?

684
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:20,039
Don't you think this article
would be more interesting to people?

685
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,105
It'd be an exclusive.

686
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:25,805
Wait. You broke off the engagement
a long time ago. When did this happen?

687
00:57:25,872 --> 00:57:28,105
We got back together recently.

688
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,638
First of all, congratulations.

689
00:57:33,138 --> 00:57:37,638
Then the Nakwon shares
that Mr. Bae has will go to you.

690
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:40,839
Then the Nakwon feud
over management control…

691
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:44,939
-Wow, what turn of events!
-Gosh, you're unbelievable.

692
00:57:45,472 --> 00:57:48,605
Is there no romance in my wedding story?

693
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:52,105
Of course not.
That's the most important part.

694
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:54,705
Romance. Reunited lovers.

695
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:56,371
Please start from the top.

696
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:58,772
When did your love begin again?

697
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:01,538
Love, huh?

698
00:58:04,338 --> 00:58:05,338
Hey!

699
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,839
-What do you think you're doing?
-Mr. Ri Moon-seong.

700
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:17,271
-Moon-seong.
-Se-yeon.

701
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:19,305
You don't have to talk to him.

702
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:22,738
I heard you've been asking around
about me.

703
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:25,572
-Look, Mr. Ri--
-Forget it.

704
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:29,005
You ask me if you have questions.
Why are you bothering her?

705
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,338
-You don't get it.
-Come whenever you want!

706
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:33,738
I'll answer your questions.

707
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:40,738
I'm warning you.
Don't ever bother her again.

708
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:53,371
Se-yeon.

709
00:58:54,438 --> 00:58:55,872
Are you an idiot?

710
00:58:55,939 --> 00:58:57,939
All you had to do was just say no.

711
00:58:58,005 --> 00:59:01,472
Why were you just sitting there,
letting him bully you?

712
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:10,138
What gives you the right?

713
00:59:10,972 --> 00:59:12,105
What?

714
00:59:12,171 --> 00:59:13,839
Because you're family?

715
00:59:14,572 --> 00:59:15,572
Is that why?

716
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:20,105
What gives you the right
to tell me what to do?

717
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:21,905
Who do you think you are?

718
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:31,305
Se-yeon.

719
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:35,205
Did you ask me what gives me the right?

720
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:40,171
I mean, what are we? Strangers?

721
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:43,271
Yes, that's right.

722
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:47,405
We're just strangers.

723
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,738
-Se-yeon.
-Isn't that right, Jae-heon?

724
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:11,472
What did you just say?

725
01:00:52,205 --> 01:00:53,939
CURTAIN CALL

726
01:00:58,972 --> 01:01:00,905
Get out of my hotel this instant!

727
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:03,572
He longed for his mother
who'd left to the South.

728
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,772
Then he started blaming her.

729
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:11,405
If Moon-seong wasn't the person you
thought he was, what would you have done?

730
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:15,605
I'm on that stage you created
before I even realized it.

731
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:17,905
All the wonderful times
we spent together--

732
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:20,438
Were you just acting because you had to?
