1
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Damn it.

3
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,567
Yoo Jae-heon!

4
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,533
-Hey, what the hell?
-Yoo Jae-heon?

5
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,433
Hey, Jae-heon!

6
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,000
What the hell?

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,300
We have very little money
to produce a play.

8
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,200
I decided to work part time
for a couple months to make money.

9
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,600
A friend from school works at this hotel.
He said the money was good.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,033
Oh, man. So you came all the way here
to work part time?

11
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,166
Come on.

12
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:24,767
Look who's talking.
You're the one who left us--

13
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:26,934
Yes, that's right.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm new to the department,
like you comrades,

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,934
and I have nothing to tell you.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Moon-seong.

17
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,800
-Oh, Se-yeon.
-Thank you for your hard work.

18
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,000
-Good day.
-Hello.

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
-Let's go eat.
-Yes.

20
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,000
-Go change and come out.
-Okay.

21
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,266
You call her "Se-yeon"?

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,567
-Is this an undercover job?
-Damn it.

23
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,533
Why did you end up here, of all places?

24
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,867
Se-yeon.

25
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,667
-Hey, let's go.
-Well,

26
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,600
the thing is…

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,667
I'm going to have dinner with the comrades
from laundry services today.

28
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,066
Oh, the guys I saw earlier?

29
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,533
Yes.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,033
We're about the same age, you know?

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,266
Yeah, that's great. Treat them to dinner.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,367
Take a taxi when you get home.

33
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,266
You can take a taxi, right?

34
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,233
No, thanks. I'm good. I have money.

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,734
Do as I say.

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,266
If the employees had to treat
the owner's family,

37
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,934
it'd be bad for our reputation.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Be sure you treat them,
even second or third rounds.

39
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,066
I don't know what to say.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,734
I understand.

41
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:00,266
Can you tell Grandma and--

42
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,433
Sure. I'll tell Jin-suk as well.

43
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,567
Se-yeon, drive home safely.

44
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,667
I will. Bye.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
What are you doing there, Jin-suk?

46
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm waiting for Jae-heon.

47
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:29,900
It's pretty late,
but he hasn't come home yet.

48
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,667
I'm worried sick.

49
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,233
He just started working there.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,700
It's going to take time for him
to get know people

51
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,166
and get used to the work.

52
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:42,000
He was totally wasted after his first day,

53
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,467
and Se-yeon was basically
carrying him on her back.

54
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,400
What if he does something weird again
after work today?

55
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,633
What is it?

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,066
Looking at you makes me think
that we're all the same.

57
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,567
Sorry?

58
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:02,367
You're just another woman
mad at her husband

59
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,300
because you don't know where he's gone.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,266
I'm not doing this for no reason.

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,400
He's not a child,
but he always hangs out with his sister,

62
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,667
and it's getting on my nerves.

63
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,700
Wow. I'm so jealous of you.

64
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,166
For what?

65
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,200
I've never felt anything like that.

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,567
I'm home.

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,500
What's going on?

68
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,667
Where's Moon-seong?

69
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:37,000
Moon-seong said he was going to
have dinner with friends at work.

70
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,066
What?

71
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,900
Friends?

72
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:40,967
Yes.

73
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:45,667
He's not one to invite his friends
out for dinner.

74
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:48,133
Oh, I guess you don't know

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,633
how approachable and sociable
he is at work.

76
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
Wait. I'm his wife.

77
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,967
I know him inside out.
How can you speak to me so harshly?

78
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,900
I wasn't being harsh.

79
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,700
He's not late
because something bad happened.

80
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,367
I'm telling you not to be too hard on him
when he gets home later.

81
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,934
-If you will excuse me.
-Good night.

82
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,000
See? He's okay, right?

83
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,900
Ri Moon-seong,
don't you dare come in. Damn it.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
So cute.

85
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,567
Okay, so you mean
the whole thing is a show.

86
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,567
But the Nakwon is the stage,

87
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,533
and the whole thing

88
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,567
is set in reality
and not the fictional world, huh?

89
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,200
They say truth is stranger than fiction,

90
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,567
but this is a little too much.

91
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,266
-Is it good?
-Yeah, it's warm and tasty.

92
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,400
I…

93
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,433
Why is this sandwich so delicious?

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,133
The bread is warm, and it warms my heart.

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,333
Having a sandwich with you guys
like it's another normal day--

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,767
I really missed this.

97
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,033
Oh, right.

98
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,100
-Yoon-hee is playing your wife?
-Yeah.

99
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,967
You two getting along?

100
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,700
Yeah. So far, so good.

101
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,667
Oh, boy.

102
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,133
Yoon-hee, Seo Yoon-hee.

103
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,166
What was that?

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,133
Hey, this is no time to sleep.

105
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Guess whom I met today?

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,200
You're late. Cut the crap.

107
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,333
"Cut the crap"?

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
-You don't want to hear it? Fine.
-What's this about?

109
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,433
Something unbelievable happened.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Seriously?

111
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,333
Damn it. Of course it's real.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,567
Oh, man.

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,767
-You met them there, of all places?
-Exactly.

114
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:33,200
What a coincidence. What are the chances?

115
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,166
That's what I'm saying.

116
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,533
Ever since Moon-seong started working
at the hotel,

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Mr. Kim has been unreasonably rude to him.

118
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,300
You sent a man who doesn't understand
capitalism to the planning office.

119
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,433
I don't think that was a good decision.

120
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,767
That's why you demoted him
to porter services.

121
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,066
Then you dumped him into laundry services.

122
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,233
Comrade Ri Moon-seong must not be
a good worker.

123
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,533
Or Mr. Kim, who happens to be
more loyal to you than anyone else,

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,300
is just giving him a hard time.

125
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,767
Do you know how hard he's trying?

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,500
-Why does this guy mean so much to you?
-We're family.

127
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,934
It's a miracle we're getting to know him
the way we are.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,133
Your real reason is that you're more
interested in the shares that he may get.

129
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:37,500
Do you think he'll be on your side
if you're nice to him?

130
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,800
You have no idea who he is
or where he's been.

131
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,834
There was a time

132
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,934
when we were on the same side.

133
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,967
We used to put our heads together
for the hotel and come up with ideas.

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,667
I still don't understand
why we're fighting like this.

135
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I just want to protect our reality
for a better future.

136
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,300
Isn't it because of your grudge?

137
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,734
When will you stop hating Nakwon?
If Mom and Dad were alive--

138
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,000
That's enough.

139
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,400
If you want to protect the hotel,
you need Dong-jae on your side.

140
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,767
You may not believe it,

141
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,467
but I didn't give Mr. Kim
any specific orders about Moon-seong.

142
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,033
If our cousin wants to be acknowledged,
he'd best prove himself.

143
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,934
Comrade! Comrade!

144
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,734
Are you busy?

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,133
-I have something to do at the hotel.
-Perfect!

146
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,333
-Please take me to the hotel too.
-No.

147
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,734
A wife can see her husband, no?

148
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,700
Well, I guess it makes sense.

149
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,467
I'm so bored sitting at home by myself.

150
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,867
Yes, that's good. I think this is enough.

151
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,033
Where can I find the laundry room?

152
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,567
Go straight this way, and you'll find it.

153
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,633
Thank you.

154
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,567
ATTORNEY HWANG - MR. JEONG MET
WITH LAWYERS ABOUT INHERITANCE.

155
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,100
Mr. Jeong Sang-cheol.

156
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,200
If you cross the line,
you'll be in trouble as well.

157
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:52,767
Yes.

158
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,500
Attorney Oh is here.

159
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
It's been a while, Ms. Oh.

160
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,233
Yes, it has.

161
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,934
If you want to protect the hotel,
you need Dong-jae on your side.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Se-yeon?

163
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:30,633
You here to see me?

164
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,066
You seem to have something to say.

165
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,233
Now that I see you, I don't want to talk.

166
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,333
I heard you're busy taking care
of your cousin these days.

167
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,900
Well, he's got quite a temper.

168
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,033
Of course, he's nice in front of you.

169
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,934
What the hell did you say to him?

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's talk face to face, at least.

171
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,867
It's not that hard.

172
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,133
Cheers! Great job today!

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,266
Great job.

174
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,667
How refreshing!

175
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh, man. It really hits the spot!

176
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,834
The queen of ad-libs, Seo--

177
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,633
Thanks for being a good colleague
to my husband.

178
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,033
Take good care of him.

179
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
He's a little ignorant,
but he's not a bad guy.

180
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,867
Certainly.

181
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,033
This is my wife.

182
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,433
What brings you here?

183
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,834
Nothing in particular.

184
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,567
So nice to meet you.

185
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,734
You could've told me you were coming.

186
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,333
Nobody's here.
Hey, what are you doing here?

187
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,166
I was bored to death alone at home.

188
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,900
You should've told me, though.

189
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:14,633
Hey, I'm so glad to meet you guys here!

190
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,567
-How have you been?
-I've been great.

191
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,066
By the way, how is it going?

192
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,967
Now that we've started,
we have to finish it.

193
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,500
-We have to make it work.
-Not that.

194
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,767
What does that mean?

195
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,266
So frustrating. He's clueless.

196
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,166
-Shall we go eat?
-I'm hungry.

197
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:36,867
Mr. Ri.

198
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,266
You know me, right?

199
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,400
Aren't you Mr. Kim's secretary?

200
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,100
The guest in our VVIP room
is looking for you.

201
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,333
Come with me.

202
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,233
Me?

203
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
Who does he think he is?

204
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,633
Mr. Ri is here.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,467
Oh, there you are. Have a seat.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,133
Moon-seong.

207
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,467
Is this what you wanted to talk about?

208
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,800
Why don't we eat together?

209
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,400
No, thanks. I'm working now.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,133
The general manager of this hotel is here,
so she can adjust your mealtime.

211
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,500
Isn't that right?

212
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,133
Let's go, Moon-seong.

213
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,500
You mean, having dinner?

214
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,900
Sounds good. Let's eat together, Se-yeon.

215
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:49,100
-Moon-seong.
-Jin-suk is also here.

216
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Jin-suk is here?

217
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,467
Yes.

218
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,300
She came to see how my work was going.

219
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,667
There are four of us, including my wife.
Is that okay?

220
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,333
Let's eat together. All four of us.

221
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Great.

222
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:08,033
Then I'll finish work and go change.

223
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,834
Wow. The chef is amazing.

224
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,100
The chef of this hotel is great,

225
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,633
but I wanted to give Se-yeon
a taste of different foods,

226
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,834
so I brought the chef-owner
of a restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.

227
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,500
I've never eaten this kind of food
in my life.

228
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,400
Thank you for this amazing experience.
Thank you.

229
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,333
Let's go somewhere else next time.

230
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,633
That would be great.

231
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,033
Do you like it, Moon-seong?

232
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,600
I've never eaten anything like this,

233
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,834
maybe because I grew up dirt poor.

234
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,800
I don't know if it tastes good
because I don't have any prior experience.

235
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,567
I think I just want to experience

236
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,367
what capitalism tastes like.

237
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:22,533
Se-yeon, I didn't know you were seeing
such a keen man.

238
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Why did you never tell me?

239
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,934
What do you mean, "keen"?

240
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
It means you're very handsome.

241
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,567
He's not keen. He's a tomato.

242
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,033
What is a tomato?

243
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,967
A tomato.

244
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,600
You're all looks and no brains.

245
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,467
By the way,
how long have you two known each other?

246
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,400
It's been over 20 years
since we first met in elementary school.

247
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,066
So you've been dating since then?

248
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,367
Twenty years?

249
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,934
It's been 20 years
since I became aware of Bae Dong-jae.

250
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,734
How long have you been dating?

251
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,500
I heard you were engaged.

252
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,133
Could it be

253
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,166
that there was no romantic relationship
between you two?

254
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,767
Well…

255
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,266
Hey, Jin-suk.

256
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:48,433
You know how in South Korean dramas,
there are marriages of convenience?

257
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,500
Do those things really happen?

258
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,467
How interesting.

259
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,900
Excuse me for a moment.

260
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,033
Hey, Jin-suk.

261
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,400
Could you not read the room?
Why were you acting like an amateur?

262
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,867
My sister was forced to be there.
Why should I go along with it?

263
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,033
Your sister?

264
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,667
What good is it to you
if you irritate him?

265
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, I don't know.

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
When did you…

267
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,533
Mr. Ri.

268
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,133
Let me take you home.

269
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,300
All right, Mr. Jeong.

270
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,333
He never backed off. Not even once.

271
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,400
It's your fault for setting it up.

272
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,934
It's good to get to know them
in advance, no?

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,834
We could team up
for future business endeavors.

274
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,633
Me, you and your cousin.

275
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,633
When we get married,
we'll be a family anyway.

276
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,800
You're so childish.

277
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,700
Does the word "family" bother you?

278
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,567
Yeah.

279
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,600
We are still like parallel lines.

280
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,233
Soon,

281
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,133
you'll want to cross those lines.

282
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,834
Se-jun.

283
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,467
The thing is,

284
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,767
I feel bad for Se-yeon.

285
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Back in the day,

286
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,667
you used to feel more sorry for her
than I did.

287
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,166
Are you going to stay home forever?

288
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,467
Aren't you leaving
your apartment empty for too long?

289
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,066
You know what?

290
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,000
You change the subject
and cut me off instead of blaming me.

291
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,533
Basically,

292
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,533
you're telling me to stop
talking about Se-yeon.

293
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,834
Would you like some snacks?

294
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,000
Se-yeon is so invested
into Moon-seong and his wife.

295
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,333
Go to sleep. I can't drink much today.

296
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,834
Hey.

297
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,400
Why are you such a bad mood?

298
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,500
I don't understand why you're so annoyed.

299
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,700
Just spit it out.

300
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,367
-Why did you act like that?
-What?

301
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,066
When we were eating earlier,

302
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,900
you could've played along with me.

303
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:04,200
You were on the offense about everything,
but you didn't need to do that.

304
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,734
I guess you're right.

305
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,900
Oh, man. Why did I do that?

306
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,400
Do you not know?

307
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,433
Seriously?

308
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,200
I really have no clue.

309
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,600
I didn't have other motives.

310
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,367
I guess I just wanted to act like that.

311
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,900
Get lost.

312
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,400
-What?
-Beat it.

313
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,133
This is the only place
I can be at this house.

314
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
Where can I go?

315
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,734
Just get out.

316
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,867
This feels like we're a real couple.

317
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:39,033
Yeah. All the better.

318
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Get out.

319
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,900
Fine, fine.

320
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,867
I'll admit I ruined the mood earlier.

321
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,734
Yeah. But should it upset you this much?

322
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,233
Don't come in until I fall asleep. Got it?

323
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,667
Moon-seong.

324
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:12,734
Se-yeon.

325
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,967
You're late.

326
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,567
What are you doing here at this hour?

327
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,934
-My wife kicked me out.
-What?

328
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:36,367
Jin-suk is very mad at me,
so she told me to beat it.

329
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:39,767
Where else can I go in South Korea
besides here?

330
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:46,600
I feel bad about what happened earlier,

331
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,400
but isn't it unfair?

332
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,367
She told me to beat it.
Who am I, Michael Jackson?

333
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,200
Why is she angry?

334
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:57,967
I don't know.

335
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,934
Why are you sorry if you don't know
why she's mad?

336
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well,

337
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:07,000
I feel bad because I can't figure out why.

338
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,066
That idiot has no idea how I feel.

339
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,600
He's a moron
who doesn't even know how he feels.

340
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,667
Do you…

341
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,433
love him?

342
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,967
That came out of nowhere.

343
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,667
Do you love Jin-suk?

344
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,367
Definitely. I love her.

345
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,567
I married her because I loved her.

346
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,567
I'm jealous.

347
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,333
You love her
and married her because of that love.

348
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,900
I think being able to be honest
with your emotions…

349
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,300
is a wonderful thing.

350
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:38,166
What's so great about being honest
with my emotions?

351
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,467
When you live in abundance

352
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,867
and have more rules to follow,

353
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,433
you start having more things to do.

354
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,934
You starting wanting more.

355
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,633
At a certain point,

356
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,300
it doesn't matter how you feel.

357
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,834
Wait.

358
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,834
Why wouldn't your emotions be important?

359
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,266
Aren't they the most important things?

360
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:09,667
My feelings, my thoughts, my heart.
Things like that?

361
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,066
You can't see or touch them.

362
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:18,667
Literally, emotions are just emotions.

363
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,433
My people, my family,

364
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,367
my hotel…

365
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,433
Yeah, I really do live in abundance.

366
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,734
I don't get it.

367
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,633
You probably don't know
because you just came from North Korea,

368
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,500
but that's capitalism.

369
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,834
Is that so?

370
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,867
These are sweet and delicious.

371
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,333
They look like it.

372
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,834
What are you reading?

373
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,333
What are you going to be when you grow up?

374
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,734
How come you're reading a self-help book
when you're sick?

375
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,200
Why is a person who's about to crawl
into a coffin reading such things?

376
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:36,533
Why do you keep saying
you're crawling into things?

377
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
You wouldn't even like
such a cramped space anyway.

378
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
Don't you want to see me married?

379
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,266
Do you even want to get married?

380
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,367
What if I do?
Can you stick around until then?

381
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,266
If you promise that you will,
then I'll do my best to get married.

382
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,934
-Just give me, like, ten years.
-My goodness.

383
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,433
Why do you despise growing up so much?

384
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,700
I don't know.

385
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:16,300
So you should stick around, Grandma.

386
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,700
You will get to see me grow up,
get married,

387
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,667
and see your grandchildren.

388
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,500
Out of the three of you,

389
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,767
you had to grow up the fastest.

390
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:41,300
I know you did your best

391
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:45,800
to keep your distance from the quarrel

392
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,033
between Se-jun and Se-yeon.

393
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
Se-gyu,

394
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,066
even after I'm gone,

395
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:59,967
could you please make sure
your brother and sister

396
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,333
get along?

397
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,967
Stop talking like you're going away.

398
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,133
Do you think…

399
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,767
we'll be okay without you?

400
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,667
Of course.

401
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,500
You'll all be fine, so don't worry.

402
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,300
I'm not so sure.

403
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,100
Too much confidence
is the cause of one's downfall anyway.

404
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,734
So why are you so confident?

405
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,166
I pretended to be strong
so you all wouldn't get scared.

406
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,033
I was terrified every single day.

407
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,066
Wow. What an actress you were.

408
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,333
So,

409
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,700
trust that life will go on.

410
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,433
Everything you ever said was right.

411
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,266
I'm sure you're right this time too…

412
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,066
but I'm already scared.

413
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,800
I am so sorry.

414
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,233
Hold me.

415
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,700
Moon-seong.

416
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:44,734
Se-yeon.

417
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,867
-Sorry. I had a lot to take care of.
-No problem.

418
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:52,033
Could we go somewhere?

419
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,233
What? Se-yeon.

420
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,433
Where are we going?

421
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:02,100
To answer your question.

422
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
What?

423
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:27,600
The sky looks like a painting of clouds.

424
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:28,900
It's such a beautiful day.

425
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,700
Is this it?

426
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,767
Se-yeon, where are we?

427
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,333
Come in.

428
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,633
Welcome. It's your first time here, right?

429
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Of course it's my first time.
You've never brought me here before.

430
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,333
I'm just kidding.

431
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,500
But what is this place?

432
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,467
My private workshop.

433
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,567
Oh, a workshop.

434
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:31,533
Did you choose all this furniture
and these decorations?

435
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
I sure did. This is my space.

436
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:36,367
I thought this sofa would look great here,
so I bought it right away.

437
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:38,266
I have an eye for things.

438
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,900
Then did you paint all of these?

439
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:47,667
Of course.
They are the things I've been working on.

440
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,400
How come you didn't become a painter?

441
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:56,333
You can't make it your profession
just because you like it.

442
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,800
People don't paint this much
because it's their hobby.

443
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,300
Even if it makes my heart beat,

444
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,066
I can't possibly abandon our hotel.

445
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:11,934
Why can't you?

446
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,567
To me, our hotel is just how life is.
It's the natural course for me.

447
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,734
Have you ever regretted it?

448
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:31,300
I don't think I have.

449
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,133
You know, where I come from,

450
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,100
there are so many people
who can't do what they'd love to do.

451
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,333
That's probably why

452
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I used to get angry
when I saw people not doing what they like

453
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,700
when they actually could.

454
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,333
So now,

455
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:07,700
it's so clear that you love painting,
but why aren't you?

456
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,066
It's not that I don't want to.

457
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
I can't.

458
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,433
You know--

459
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,700
I just can't.

460
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:19,533
Not now.

461
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,333
They were my parents.

462
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,133
Is that right?

463
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:48,500
It feels a little weird

464
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,333
looking at my parents with you.

465
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:56,767
You and I have the same grandmother
but different sets of parents.

466
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,867
It's really an extraordinary relationship.

467
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,767
They both passed away…

468
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,500
in a plane crash.

469
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,200
They were on a tour
of foreign hotel chains.

470
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,700
They were on an airplane
from the US to Europe.

471
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,700
It's been over ten years.

472
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,066
I think that's when

473
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:33,100
Se-jun really started to hate the hotel.

474
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,300
So the only person
who can protect the hotel…

475
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,433
is me.

476
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,033
Let's go.

477
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Se-yeon.

478
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,600
Can I have the key, please?

479
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,066
Why?

480
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,700
Just give it to me, please.

481
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:18,433
Didn't I tell you?
I drove military tanks in North Korea.

482
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:21,600
But still.

483
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:24,300
Come on. Please get in.

484
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,934
Don't I look awesome?

485
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,633
Yes, you do.

486
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,166
I told you I don't want dinner.

487
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,667
I know.

488
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:52,800
Every time you were scolded
by your father, you didn't want dinner.

489
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,567
I used to make you this:

490
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,600
misugaru with a whole lot of sugar.

491
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:04,667
It's delicious. It tastes the same.

492
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:07,233
I like this better
when it's mixed with milk.

493
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,700
People's taste in food doesn't change.

494
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:20,233
You're the type of person who would enjoy
the food you liked when you were young.

495
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,333
Is that so?

496
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,533
So,

497
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,300
I am sure your heart for the hotel
and for Se-yeon is still the same.

498
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,467
Why are you being so stubborn?

499
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
I spoke out of turn.

500
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:43,900
So what?

501
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:49,567
Who else in this house can ask me
such questions but you?

502
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,433
It's true. I once loved the hotel.

503
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,567
Grandma loves it,

504
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,900
and my parents devoted their lives to it.

505
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,567
-I was also asked to learn the business.
-I know.

506
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,700
Grandma spent her whole life building
that hotel like a lighthouse on the spot

507
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:17,333
where she's been waiting for her husband
and son she left behind in North Korea.

508
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:22,033
All those reasons combined
were why my parents died:

509
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,800
from working too much.

510
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,967
My grandmother used us all as tools.

511
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:34,800
Grandma made her wish come true
by having Se-yeon build her lighthouse.

512
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,633
You have no idea how much
your grandmother loves all of you.

513
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,600
We'll find out once we sell the hotel

514
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,000
whether it's this hotel
that's like a lighthouse

515
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,900
or us that are more important.

516
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:58,133
I'm curious to see how she would react
when she sees that until the end,

517
00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:01,767
Se-yeon and I have our backs
against each other.

518
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,934
You drive so well.

519
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,233
Really?

520
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,500
It's pretty cool.

521
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,467
I've done pretty much everything
since I was young.

522
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:20,734
From the Kaema Plateau to
the Manchurian Plain to deliver goods,

523
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,166
I ran nonstop
for three days and three nights.

524
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,533
Wow. You are amazing.

525
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,500
Do you think so?

526
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:35,867
These soft, paved roads in the South
are like a bed to me.

527
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,066
Wait!

528
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,100
Do you have a South Korean license?
Let me do the talking.

529
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,467
Se-yeon.

530
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,467
Don't say anything. Just sit tight.

531
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,600
What do you mean?

532
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,500
You can't say anything.

533
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,667
Ready? Go.

534
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:17,000
Excuse me. Please show me your ID.

535
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,767
This is just a quick traffic stop.
Show me your ID, please.

536
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:28,433
To be or not to be? That is the question.

537
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,033
It's raining now

538
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,233
How much is this?

539
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,800
I love you

540
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,867
I see. You can't speak? Can he speak?

541
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,700
I guess he can't really speak.

542
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,333
Don't you know sign language?

543
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,166
This is a problem!

544
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,033
I said it's raining

545
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,367
I meant your ID.

546
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,233
How much is this? I meant this!

547
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
I love you

548
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,467
No, just your ID.

549
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,433
One second, please.

550
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:20,200
YOO JAE-HEON
SORRY I DON'T HAVE MY ID.

551
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:30,533
PERSONAL INFORMATION

552
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

553
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,734
How did you do that?

554
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,600
Were you using sign language?
What did you tell him?

555
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:54,433
Se-yeon, I had no idea what I was doing.

556
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,567
You are really amazing.

557
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,633
-Is he following us?
-Awesome!

558
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,200
Do you see my hands shaking?

559
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:06,834
Oh, my gosh…

560
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,734
Don't you think I pulled it off well?

561
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,233
You were awesome. Wow.

562
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,133
Good night.

563
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,533
GOOD NIGHT.

564
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,667
RI MOON-SEONG
GOOD NIGHT.

565
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,667
What an oddball.

566
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:16,967
JEONG SANG-CHEOL

567
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:20,934
Oh, shit.

568
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,066
You're one strange man. Good night.

569
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,367
JILIN PROVINCE, CHINA

570
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:49,500
How did it go?

571
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:03,100
-My passport?
-I already told you.

572
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,734
Give me 250,000 yuan,
and that passport is yours.

573
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Show me.

574
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:18,467
Do you see?

575
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:22,033
A Chinese passport
with Ri Moon-seong's name on it.

576
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,400
You can go anywhere with this.

577
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:27,767
Even South Korea.

578
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,700
You only need to replenish the 5,000 yuan
you got this time a hundred times.

579
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,467
Is that so hard?

580
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,567
If you are lying or messing with me,

581
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,967
I am going to kill you.

582
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,900
You son of a bitch.

583
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,133
Hey, Ri Moon-seong.

584
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,767
Who else would make
these Chinese passports

585
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:57,400
for a bastard from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea?

586
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,133
Know what I mean?

587
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,066
That piece of shit.

588
00:46:23,934 --> 00:46:25,166
Father!

589
00:46:25,734 --> 00:46:27,934
Father!

590
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,800
With 250,000 yuan,

591
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,467
I can go to South Korea.

592
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:11,834
I'll make sure
your message is delivered, Dad.

593
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,834
I'll tell her how you died.

594
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:45,934
Moon-seong, put me down if you are tired.

595
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:47,967
Look, Grandma.

596
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,533
You should gotten
on my back earlier, right?

597
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm not tired. You are light as a feather.

598
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,233
Oh, my.

599
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,967
If it were like the old days,
I could walk a thousand miles.

600
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,900
I'm fine.

601
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:06,934
Grandma, I even crossed the Tumen River
with a load of bundles.

602
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:14,467
By the way, Grandma, where are we?

603
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:15,667
Look.

604
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,900
Your grandpa told me he would cross
the waters and meet me over there.

605
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:27,667
When I spent hours looking at the horizon,

606
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:34,500
it felt as though your grandpa
and your father would arrive on a boat.

607
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:41,166
I always imagined them standing

608
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,800
at the bow of the boat

609
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,266
as the sun set quickly.

610
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,734
I should stop coming here.

611
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,900
Why?

612
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,767
Because you're here.

613
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,633
Thank you for having grown up
to be a good man.

614
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,734
This is enough now, so put me down.

615
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,633
No, I am okay.

616
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:30,233
Grandma, why don't we walk a bit longer?

617
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,066
…TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR
THE FORTHCOMING ETERNAL REST.

618
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,834
PLEASE JOIN US
FOR THIS CELEBRATION.

619
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,166
SINCERELY, JA GEUM-SUN.

620
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,633
Did you ask for me, ma'am?

621
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:21,834
I need fancy invitations made with this.
Okay?

622
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,800
It will be the last banquet of my life.

623
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,400
You take charge, Mr. Jeong.

624
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:36,133
I'll make sure it's done.

625
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:44,233
This will be the last banquet I'm hosting.

626
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,467
And these are the invitations.

627
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:50,867
I am giving each of you ten invitations,

628
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:55,834
so you can invite the ten people
who are most important to you

629
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,734
and their family members.

630
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,266
Question.

631
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:04,600
Does it have to be ten?

632
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,200
If I don't limit you to ten,

633
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,700
wouldn't you bring a hundred
or even a thousand groups?

634
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:10,633
Of course I would bring a thousand groups.

635
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,033
Nature gave us ten fingers,
so it's natural for us to count in tens.

636
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,633
If they are the relationships
that I can count with my ten fingers,

637
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,400
then surely they are precious ones,
aren't they?

638
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:29,133
You get only ten invitations.

639
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,633
-Moon-seong?
-Yes?

640
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,533
Make sure you and Jin-suk are there.

641
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,533
People that are important to me--

642
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,934
I want to introduce them to you.

643
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,633
Grandma, as you know,

644
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,100
we have nowhere to go.

645
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,467
I promise I will be there with Jin-suk.

646
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,433
-Of course we will be there.
-That's great.

647
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,166
THE NAKWON HOTEL

648
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,633
Mr. Park, do you have a minute?

649
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,433
Of course. Did you get the invitation?

650
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,800
Yes, I did receive it.
Thank you for the invitation.

651
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,300
I am glad.

652
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:52,900
Key people related to our hotel M&A
will attend the event that day,

653
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:56,266
so I think it would be nice if you came
to meet and greet everyone.

654
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:59,667
Please feel free
to bring your family and friends.

655
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,133
Sure. Thank you for your kindness.

656
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,233
Well, I will see you then.

657
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,200
DAUGHTER

658
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,867
Where the hell is she?

659
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,033
Are you inviting me?

660
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,667
Of course I am.

661
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:28,734
Nice. I don't have to fly that day.
Awesome!

662
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,500
I only have ten invitations.

663
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:35,266
-Really?
-It means that I really care about you.

664
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,266
-Don't you forget that.
-How could I possibly forget that?

665
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,767
-You can meet him that day.
-Who?

666
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:45,867
-My cousin.
-That guy from North Korea?

667
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:49,000
Fantastic!

668
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,600
-Are you going?
-Did you say it's in the grand ballroom?

669
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Yes.

670
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,900
I have no reason not to.
It's only 30 seconds away.

671
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:04,934
That's always your problem.

672
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,834
Did I ask why you can't come?

673
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,934
I only asked if you were.

674
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:15,100
You can just come,
but you always say things that way.

675
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,700
It's been a while
since you've seen my grandma.

676
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,734
How's her health?

677
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,233
She's fine for now.

678
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,300
I'm not so sure.

679
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,100
So you should come and see her.

680
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:35,333
And my family too.

681
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:38,767
Okay.

682
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:41,166
I've got to go.

683
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,200
Are you inviting anyone, Mr. Jeong?

684
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,700
I'm not. I don't have anyone to invite.

685
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,400
Is everything okay these days?

686
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:20,900
You look so serious all the time.

687
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,433
Do I really?

688
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,300
I've never felt like this way
since I met the chairwoman.

689
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:33,367
I worry if each day will go by
without any problems.

690
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,567
I get anxious and nervous constantly.

691
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,333
A person

692
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:40,567
cannot do everything alone.

693
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,233
Don't overburden yourself.

694
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,133
Is that right?

695
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,800
FAREWELL PARTY

696
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:08,166
-Guys, Wook-hyeong is here.
-Hey, Se-gyu.

697
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:09,367
What's up, man?

698
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,333
Why are you here so early?

699
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,400
We got here on time.
You've got to show up on time.

700
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,800
Are you nervous to stand
in front of people?

701
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:29,767
Not at all. I'm glad they're here.

702
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:32,367
I wonder who came today.

703
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:37,100
And I'm curious and anxious to find out
who my grandchildren invited.

704
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,266
Please take it slow.

705
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:43,800
If you are feeling well,
it is most likely because of your mood.

706
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,166
So as soon as you feel something is off--

707
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:48,767
Do you have to be so strict,
even on a day like this?

708
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:53,400
I'm aware of my own condition.
So relax and don't worry.

709
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:56,734
Thinking like that is a problem.

710
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,400
Chairwoman,
don't trust your mood too much.

711
00:56:59,467 --> 00:57:01,400
Goodness. Enough with your nagging.

712
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,667
Your nagging is going to send me
to my grave early.

713
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,600
Se-yeon!

714
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:36,667
Hey!

715
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:39,333
You both look really great.

716
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,700
Thank you. It must be these fancy clothes.
You look beautiful, Se-yeon.

717
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:46,400
-You look pretty.
-Thank you.

718
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,533
Se-yeon, where is Grandma?

719
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,633
She's in the waiting room
but will be out once the banquet starts.

720
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,000
I understand.

721
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:57,500
Wow. There are so many people here.

722
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:00,400
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for having me.

723
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,233
You must be very nervous.
Jin-suk, are you okay? What's up?

724
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,667
It's great to see you.

725
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,033
Hey, Se-yeon!

726
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,200
Hyo-jin!

727
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,233
-Hey, what's up?
-Someone I know is here.

728
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,600
-What?
-You look beautiful.

729
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:41,133
Remember the cousin I told you about?

730
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,667
Right. Your cousin from North Korea?

731
00:58:43,734 --> 00:58:45,934
-I will introduce him to you.
-Okay, great.

732
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,233
Moon-seong!

733
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,433
Moon-seong!

734
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:57,934
Moon-seong!

735
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,100
CURTAIN CALL

736
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:37,433
I prepared a farewell party today.

737
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Please send me off with a smile.

738
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,867
Today, the chairwoman wrote a new will.

739
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:48,533
-I don't think I can do this.
-Do you mind if I quit now?

740
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,700
Ri Moon-seong, who the hell are you?

741
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:54,734
You mean you need proof
that I am who I say I am?

742
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,266
You are working a part-time job here?
Mr. Yoo Jae-heon?

743
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,400
We look forward
to your affirmative answer.

744
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:01,600
So you have information?

745
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,500
From now on, it's an all-out war.

746
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,767
There's something I want,
but I can't have it.

747
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,867
If someone fills the void,
I think that is love,

748
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:10,934
whether it's money, fame or shares.

749
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:17,367
