1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,567
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,333
How was the drive here?

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
EPISODE 4

4
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:38,467
It was fine.

5
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,166
Wait, Se-yeon.

6
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:44,367
The car you sent to pick me up--
What was it?

7
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,066
You know, the big, black car?

8
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,700
The thing with that car is

9
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:52,500
that if I could push back the seat,
I could stretch my legs.

10
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,100
It was such a comfortable ride.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,200
-You're the best. Thank you.
-That's great.

12
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,600
Miss Park Se-yeon.

13
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,066
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

14
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,100
You seemed close to someone
I've never met before.

15
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:15,333
I see. I will call a manager for you.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,934
I'm off now, and I'm on personal business.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Exactly.

18
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:22,066
I called you because it seemed private.

19
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,633
Well…

20
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,800
-What's going on?
-I'm the man who will marry Miss Park.

21
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,967
What?

22
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,400
You seem close to the woman
I'm going to marry. Who are you?

23
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,667
Se-yeon.

24
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,133
Is everything this comrade is saying true?

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,533
-No, Moon-seong. Don't worry about it.
-Did you hear that?

26
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,100
I heard about the cousin
who came from North Korea.

27
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,667
It must've been difficult
to cross the border.

28
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,100
I'll take care of you like my own brother.

29
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,100
Shall we talk over tea?

30
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,834
-Bae Dong-jae.
-What?

31
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,266
So,

32
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,867
we met just now, right?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,266
-Of course.
-But you're speaking informally.

34
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,400
It makes us feel closer, no?

35
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,900
Where I came from,
we don't answer to such impoliteness.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,100
Se-yeon.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,467
Let's go.

38
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,633
Sorry for speaking informally.

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,867
I thought it'd be better
if we appeared closer.

40
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,867
I've never seen her like that before.

41
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,734
What do you think?

42
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,500
I can only say

43
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,000
that you and Grandma are amazing.

44
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,133
-Moon-seong.
-Yes?

45
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,367
I am so sorry.

46
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:27,166
Wait. What are you doing?

47
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,433
I need to clean up.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,900
No way!

49
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,000
I broke the cup, and I'm younger than you.

50
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,200
Why should you bother with my mess?

51
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,533
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,066
You okay? Are you hurt?

53
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:46,834
I am fine.

54
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,100
That was a surprise.

55
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,066
You run around,
taking care of everyone else,

56
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,834
but it seems you don't know how
to take care of yourself.

57
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,500
It may be because my habit
as a hotelier kicked in.

58
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,967
By the way,
I've never thought of it that way,

59
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,567
nor had anybody told me that.

60
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,867
I hope that's the case.

61
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,133
What?

62
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,867
No, it's nothing.

63
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,900
Feel free to tell me what to do
from now on.

64
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,367
Really?

65
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,633
Isn't that what a younger brother is for?

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
Splendid.

67
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:42,900
I've always envied my friends
who have reliable younger brothers.

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,300
I also used to think how nice it would be

69
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:51,867
if I had a sibling, older or younger.

70
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,567
I mean, when I was young. But now…

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,233
Go ahead and drink.

72
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,033
Here's your juice.

73
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:38,300
Are you really trying
to sell the hotel for money?

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,667
Don't you have enough cash?

75
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,967
What do you want to know?

76
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:47,633
I mean, Nakwon is a symbol of our family.

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,533
Also, Bilton knows
what a great hotel this is.

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,066
That's why I'm selling it.

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,166
What do you mean? But why?

80
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,300
Why is that?

81
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,300
You always walk away while I'm talking.

82
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,567
Stay

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,333
On the path

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,033
That a wife must take

85
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,166
It's really fascinating that
people sing this song even over there.

86
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,500
Isn't it, ma'am?

87
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,367
It was a song before the liberation.

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,533
It's called "The Enlightenment Song."
They played it often when I was a child.

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,667
I see.

90
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,433
-Anything else?
-Yeah, is there another one?

91
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,367
I'm not sure if you know this song.

92
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,533
The baby briers

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,066
Are in bloom

94
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,066
The land of the South is my hometown

95
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,200
A small cottage

96
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:08,066
On the hill

97
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:13,667
How much I miss it all

98
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,667
Biting purple sash

99
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:24,200
Between my teeth

100
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:31,000
Soaked in tears

101
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,967
She's a songbird.

102
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,900
You used to sing

103
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,333
Farewell songs to me

104
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:46,834
I will never forget you

105
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,900
You sing really well.

106
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,266
-You could be a singer.
-Wow, really.

107
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,100
I've never seen her smile
like that before.

108
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,967
That's enough for me.

109
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,433
Se-yeon, how can a hotel be so enormous?

110
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,934
-Look, Se-yeon.
-Yes?

111
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,867
I have a cell phone.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,433
-Where did you get it?
-Comrade Sang-cheol got this for me.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,300
That's great.

114
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,000
Isn't this the embodiment of capitalism?

115
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,734
Can I have your telephone number, please?

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
You want my digits, huh?

117
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,467
Digits? What's that?

118
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,500
Digits. Like numbers.

119
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,367
Right. Digits, as in numbers.

120
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,567
"You want my digits, my phone number."

121
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,900
Then I'd like your digits.

122
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,600
Sure.

123
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,166
So, this is your number?

124
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:27,367
-Hi, Moon-seong.
-Se-yeon, I can hear you well.

125
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,834
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I hear you well.

126
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:37,467
Wait. I have something to tell you.

127
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,567
-Hey.
-What?

128
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,100
We have a problem.

129
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,633
-What is it?
-We have to play golf tomorrow.

130
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,467
What the hell are you saying?

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,700
Shit. Here's the thing.

132
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,800
Golf?

133
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,066
Yes.

134
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,400
You mean, hitting a ball while walking
and getting a sunburned face

135
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,066
under the scorching sun?

136
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,667
Golf is so popular right now.

137
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,867
What does it have to do with me?

138
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,967
Nothing beats golf when it comes to
getting to know new people.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,934
No way. I don't want to.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,166
How can I possibly play
when I've never done it before?

141
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,233
That's why I am going to teach you.

142
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,500
If you learn the basics, rather than
playing awkwardly, you get better quickly.

143
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,834
-I'm not interested.
-Bring your wife too.

144
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,333
A lot of couples play together.

145
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,934
Well,

146
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,633
I will have to discuss that with my wife.

147
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,834
Let's go.

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
So, I just couldn't say no to her face.

149
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,800
Don't look at me like that.

150
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,633
It has been decided for us.
We must play golf tomorrow.

151
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,967
Playing golf isn't the problem.

152
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,133
The real problem is…

153
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,233
-I shoot 80.
-Come again?

154
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm really good.

155
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,066
Do you know it's harder for a good player
to pretend not to play well?

156
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,567
Of course I know.

157
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:23,300
That's the problem.

158
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:27,300
How about you?

159
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
What?

160
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,600
You can't play golf, can you?

161
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes, I can.

162
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,667
What?

163
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,800
Why the hell would you play?

164
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,667
Since I was young, my parents--

165
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,433
Doesn't matter.

166
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:44,767
We can't go.

167
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,367
We can't take such a risk.

168
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,533
-Let's tell her you're sick.
-All of a sudden?

169
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,533
Tell her you have an upset stomach
and can't make it.

170
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,367
Okay, let's go with that.

171
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,000
Moon-seong.

172
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,033
Yes, Se-yeon.

173
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Here.

174
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,600
I got these for you guys.

175
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,367
-What are these?
-Golf starts with golf apparel.

176
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:19,367
This outfit will get you halfway there.

177
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,133
Oh, really?

178
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,433
Be sure you wear that tomorrow.
You too, Jin-suk.

179
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,934
-Thank you, Se-yeon.
-Sure.

180
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,333
Do you see this?

181
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,166
We have to go tomorrow.

182
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,767
Looks that way.

183
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,967
My head hurts. What do we do?

184
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,367
Jae-heon.

185
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:58,467
Switch your hands.

186
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,900
-What?
-Use your weak hand.

187
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:04,667
That way, you won't be able to play well
even if you try.

188
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:05,767
Try it.

189
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,900
This is how we usually hold it,

190
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,467
but the opposite way…

191
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,433
I can't play anymore!

192
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,667
-Right?
-This is what I'll do.

193
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,767
You said you were busy.
Obviously you practiced.

194
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:35,834
No, I didn't.

195
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,266
You both look fabulous.

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,867
They say clothes make the man.
You have impeccable taste.

197
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,300
You want to try this?

198
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,767
I've never learned it properly.

199
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,533
Just have fun in the beginning.
It'll motivate you later.

200
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,667
You're right. You go first.

201
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,233
Gently wrap it with your right hand.

202
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,567
You stretch it out at first.

203
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,600
That's right.

204
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,633
And then bring it to here.

205
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,233
Bravo! Birdie!

206
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:20,266
It doesn't seem like you're playing
for the first time.

207
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,400
"Soksalssusigae" skill
is about getting the hang of it.

208
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,467
"Soksalssusigae"?

209
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,266
You call the putter Soksalssusigae?

210
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,667
By the way, birdie is just "birdie"?

211
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,066
That's right. I heard it too.
You said "birdie."

212
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,734
It's called ppar in North Korea.

213
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,633
We use the Western term for "birdie."

214
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,800
Wait. Hold on.

215
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,066
Good. Why don't you help him?

216
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,867
You're holding it wrong.

217
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,567
-Look.
-I see.

218
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,433
Put your right hand here first,

219
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,066
then you wrap it with your thumb.

220
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,300
And then…

221
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,533
What about Se-yeon?

222
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,734
She wants to take care of him
because he's family.

223
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,400
A cousin that she's never met
from North Korea.

224
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:24,233
She said, "I'd like you to live with us
for the rest of our lives."

225
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,700
Say something, please.

226
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,133
Whether he is family or not,
we cannot be so sure yet.

227
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,133
What are you saying?

228
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
How do we know
that he's actually Ri Moon-seong?

229
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:40,800
What?

230
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:45,033
A grandson she's been searching for
appears with such dramatic timing?

231
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, something like this doesn't happen
by chance or miracle.

232
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,300
So, you're saying

233
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,333
our little cousin Ri Moon-seong could be

234
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,734
a con artist?

235
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,133
You've seen too much TV.

236
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,734
That ain't it.

237
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Park Se-gyu.

238
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,533
When you decided not to get involved

239
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:17,400
with the hotel or the family,
I respected your decision.

240
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,133
Yeah, I know.

241
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,100
However, if you refuse to be
on anybody's side or protect anything,

242
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:29,467
when you lose the things you took for
granted, you'll have no say in the matter.

243
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,600
What do you mean? Lose what?

244
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,133
Whether he is real or fake,

245
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:39,266
just think about what would happen
if he stayed.

246
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,633
You came to see me because you're anxious.

247
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:46,066
You never call me first.

248
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,400
Cousin, what is this?

249
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,967
I am so sorry.

250
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,934
I hope I didn't wake your wife.

251
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,367
I don't know if she woke up or not.

252
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,400
The night's just begun.

253
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:19,734
It's a crime to sleep at this hour
in this democracy-- that is, South Korea.

254
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm going to take you
to a few awesome places. Let's go.

255
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:31,500
I want to welcome you to Seoul properly.

256
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,233
Right now, in the middle of the night?

257
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,367
You don't know how long you'll be here,

258
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,900
so you may as well get a taste of life
here before heading back.

259
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,533
I bet you've never seen a place like this.
Isn't this awesome?

260
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,266
-Yes.
-Do you feel awkward?

261
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,500
Cheers!

262
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,834
what would you like to do?

263
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,934
What do you mean?

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,834
You've reunited with Grandma
and have family here now.

265
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,266
However, your new family is not like
any other family.

266
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,233
So isn't this a great opportunity
for you to do everything you haven't done

267
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,667
but would love to do?

268
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:25,834
I just want to live a modest
and quiet life with my wife.

269
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,033
Who would want to live a loud, crazy life?

270
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,433
You are modest.

271
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,266
What do you want?

272
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,834
Me? I don't want anything.

273
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,233
I already have everything.

274
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,900
-Easy and slow.
-Easy and slow.

275
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,667
You know what?

276
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,300
Se-yeon and I love that you are here.
Well, my brother is like--

277
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,900
I mean, he's the eldest.

278
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,333
He is suspicious of you.

279
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,567
-Is that so?
-So, I have an idea.

280
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,266
Let's make it undeniable.

281
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:25,233
Perhaps a DNA test
would settle it right away.

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,033
-DNA test?
-Oh, you guys don't have that up there?

283
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,467
Oh, a paternity test.

284
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,266
We do a lot of paternity tests here.

285
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,567
We put a few strands of hair in a machine

286
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:44,266
and find out whether you're family or not
right away.

287
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,533
Shall we? Come on.

288
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,734
Oh, my!

289
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Cousin!

290
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:00,967
I am disappointed.

291
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,333
I came all the way just to see my grandma,

292
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,200
and that's what you have to say to me?

293
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Have a seat.

294
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,133
Sit down.

295
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,567
I know what you've been through.
Of course I do.

296
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:22,600
That's why you should just get rid of
any potential for doubt.

297
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,166
Then enjoy your life comfortably
here in the South.

298
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,533
Does Grandma know about this?

299
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,433
Does she now that you two are suspicious
and are conspiring against me?

300
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,233
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

301
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,734
I'm doing this for you.

302
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,967
-This is why reunification isn't easy.
-I'm not interested!

303
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,867
You don't even know where you're going.

304
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,500
-Let go of me.
-Hey, babe.

305
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Se-gyu.

306
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,967
It's been so long.
I don't see you around anymore.

307
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:02,633
Right. I have no idea why.

308
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,800
I am sorry. You've gotten prettier
since I last saw you.

309
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,767
Did that jog your memory?

310
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:21,367
Maybe I remember you, maybe I don't.
Where's the need for violence?

311
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,934
What did you say?

312
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,033
-No, no!
-Get over here!

313
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,734
-Wait, wait!
-Damn you!

314
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,633
Wait, wait. Calm down! Calm down, comrade!

315
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
Who the hell are you?

316
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,934
I am this man's cousin!

317
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,600
Se-gyu, are you okay?

318
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,900
You've got to be kidding.

319
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,533
Wait, wait.

320
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,367
What the hell?

321
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,800
It's not me!
I've got nothing to do with you!

322
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,867
Get over here.

323
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,934
-Wait.
-Please let go!

324
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,066
Let me go! Let's talk!

325
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,633
You're hurting my head!

326
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:10,100
That woman was as strong as a bull.
Who was she?

327
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,367
-I have no clue.
-What?

328
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:18,834
I tried to remember,
but I really have no idea.

329
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,200
How can you laugh
when we had our hair ripped out?

330
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,100
This is one of my favorite places.
I'd be too embarrassed to come back.

331
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:33,900
Se-gyu,

332
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:38,300
are you really not interested
in the hotel business?

333
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,767
Yeah. Life is good without it.

334
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:45,467
In technical terms, we call it "ballin'."

335
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:52,533
Everyone runs so hard towards their goals
and tries to accomplish something.

336
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,600
Well, is that really necessary?

337
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,100
No one knows what tomorrow brings.

338
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:02,400
You work yourself to death, and suddenly
you can drop dead just like that.

339
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,800
How pointless and shameful would that be?

340
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:14,233
Wouldn't be even more pointless
to not try at all

341
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:17,266
because you think it's pointless?

342
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,033
I've come this far

343
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:27,900
just to see Grandma
without knowing what was ahead of me.

344
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Wouldn't it be more terrifying

345
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:36,166
to regret not doing anything
than to feel like it's all pointless?

346
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,333
So,

347
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,433
you went out with Se-gyu
in the middle of the night?

348
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,767
Yes. It was him, Se-gyu. The odd one out.

349
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,266
I was kidnapped and interrogated,
and I was so anxious.

350
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,500
Mr. Jeong,
you'll have to pay double for the risk.

351
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,033
-You were kidnapped and interrogated?
-Yes.

352
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,100
I took him to a club last night.

353
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:12,266
I asked our young cousin to take
a DNA test

354
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:15,333
so we can clear the air
and keep things simple.

355
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,066
It's a great idea.

356
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,133
-So?
-What do you mean, "so"?

357
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,233
I flat-out asked him to give me his hair.

358
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,633
What?

359
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,667
He was surprised at first.

360
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:33,667
I haven't known you that long,

361
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:34,800
but I think…

362
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,834
you are a lot of fun.

363
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,433
What I tried to pull tonight was not…

364
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,767
In order not to be awkward in the future,

365
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:52,166
that paternity test…

366
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Are you out of your mind, you idiot?

367
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:05,433
The more suspicious they are,
the more you have to push forward.

368
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,967
A thought came to me later.

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,100
He didn't even really do anything,

370
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:17,200
but it was absurd of me to be wary,
judgmental and doubtful.

371
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,667
So you trust him
because you hung out once?

372
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,266
It's not that I trust him. I just don't
feel like doubting him anymore.

373
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,133
Look.

374
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,166
Why did you give it to him?

375
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,233
Mr. Jeong,
do you really think I gave him my hair?

376
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:52,834
What?

377
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,433
You took Se-gyu's hair?

378
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,734
So whether they test it or not,
no need to worry.

379
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,900
So, you mean

380
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,700
it's better to get tested
than be suspected by family members.

381
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:13,767
Exactly.

382
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,300
Wow. You're pretty clever.

383
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
That's good.

384
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,800
MATCHES 16 OUT OF 16 ITEMS:
PROBABILITY OF DNA MATCH: 99.999%

385
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,934
So he is her grandson.

386
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,800
Grandma, how do you like it here?
Isn't it beautiful?

387
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,233
Yes, it is.

388
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,500
It soothes me.

389
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:17,633
The sea was so calm and peaceful.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,467
It's the same sea,

391
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,033
but the waves…

392
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:34,200
were so cruel and unkind to me.

393
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,967
I can finally appreciate

394
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,367
the beauty of the sea.

395
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,767
Ma'am, I didn't know you were here.

396
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,767
There you are, Mr. Jeong.
Why don't you come sit with me?

397
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,934
I will.

398
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,700
You look really happy today, ma'am.

399
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:08,567
Do I?

400
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,500
Mr. Jeong.

401
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:14,300
You look like you're in a good mood.

402
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Me?

403
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:20,266
I've never seen that look
on your face before.

404
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Grandma.

405
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:28,800
Do you know how firm Mr. Jeong is with us?

406
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,800
His solemnity beats anybody's.

407
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,934
-Is he really?
-Yes.

408
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:37,600
You shouldn't be afraid of him.

409
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:42,934
He was such a troublemaker
when he was your age.

410
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,834
You'd never seen such a thug.

411
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,100
For real? Was he really?

412
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,000
He cried and clung to me.

413
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,400
He asked for just one chance
and said he would never waste his life.

414
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:02,300
He promised he would turn his life around.

415
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,633
Grandma, it's Se-yeon.

416
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,433
Se-yeon.

417
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:21,533
I am with Grandma and Mr. Jeong.

418
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,867
Everything's okay here.

419
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:25,467
What?

420
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,600
You mean, right now?

421
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,934
I'm pretty close to the hotel.
I'll come over.

422
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:39,967
Sure.

423
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,667
Se-yeon wants me to meet her at the hotel.

424
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay. Go ahead.

425
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,500
Mr. Jeong, I leave her in your hands.

426
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:56,734
Of course.

427
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,934
So, you used to be…

428
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,600
Ta-da.

429
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,500
EIGHT-PROVINCE EXCURSION PROJECT
FOR RI MOON-SEONG

430
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,000
I got something for you.

431
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,200
Oh, what's this?

432
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,633
Since it's you and your wife's first time
in South Korea,

433
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,200
I made an itinerary for you to visit
the most famous tourist attractions

434
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,867
for seven nights and eight days.

435
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,533
It's the Eight-Province Excursion Project.

436
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,667
What do you think? Look at this.

437
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:37,934
Se-yeon.

438
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,767
It's only been a short while
since we got here.

439
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:44,333
-So we know nothing about its geography.
-No worries.

440
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm going to be your guide.

441
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,233
-Look at this.
-What?

442
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,200
On the first day,
we'll be in Seoul and go to a museum.

443
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,266
Gangwon-do, then Gyeongsang-do.

444
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,834
Oh, we're going to Busan.

445
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:00,300
Then to Chungcheong-do. That's it.

446
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,533
So what do you think?

447
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,400
You prepared all this?

448
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,934
Se-yeon.

449
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:15,934
You see,

450
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,367
there was something

451
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:23,166
I always said to Jin-suk.

452
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:27,300
If we go to South Korea,

453
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,700
we want to travel

454
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:33,633
where our feet take us without planning.

455
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,133
We should be able to travel

456
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,700
without feeling like
we're pressed for time.

457
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,166
I see.

458
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,400
I'd like to go…

459
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,133
on a trip…

460
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,100
with just Jin-suk.

461
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,200
Would you mind if we did that?

462
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:02,900
No. Go ahead.

463
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,467
I appreciate what you tried to do here.

464
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,166
It's a shame.

465
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,633
Going sightseeing?

466
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,867
Yes.

467
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:21,400
We haven't been anywhere
since we came to South Korea.

468
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,900
I hear there are a lot of tourist sites.

469
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,400
-Sunny…
-Sunnyland.

470
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,800
Sunnyland.
Right. I heard Sunnyland is famous here.

471
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,867
Just as Mt. Kumgang is famous
in North Korea,

472
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,367
Mt. Seoraksan is famous here.

473
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,734
I'd like to go there.

474
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,700
There is a famous saying:
"The East Sea and Mt. Paektu."

475
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,934
I'd like to see what the East Sea is like.

476
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,934
-That's right.
-All right.

477
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,734
You couldn't go anywhere

478
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,567
because you were spending time with me.

479
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,000
Feel free to go.

480
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,000
For how many days will it be?

481
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,967
-We're planning for about seven days.
-Seven days.

482
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,767
Hey, stay put.

483
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,600
This is for you.

484
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,200
What's this, Grandma?

485
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,800
Oh, my.

486
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,100
No, thank you, Grandma.

487
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,567
-Take it.
-I can't.

488
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:24,066
-It's for you.
-Please don't.

489
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:28,800
Eat delicious food
and buy whatever you want.

490
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:34,433
Have a good time there

491
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,900
and come back safely, okay?

492
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes.

493
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,533
We're free.

494
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,467
The air's different. I can breathe now.

495
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,333
All right.

496
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,266
Get in the car.

497
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:06,467
Let us know if anything happens.
Don't give us any surprises.

498
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
-Yeah, Mr. Jeong. Think of your age.
-Get in.

499
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,066
Yes, sir.

500
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,000
It's already been 30 years.

501
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:33,767
Time really flies, right?

502
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:39,000
The kids who left here are still asking me

503
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,867
who Daddy Long Legs is.

504
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,333
When I was also here as a kid,

505
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,633
there was another Daddy Long Legs.

506
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:57,367
I'm just happy to see the kids here,

507
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:00,433
growing up well, with hopes and dreams.

508
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:03,700
That's enough for me.

509
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,533
Oh, that's right.
Do you remember Jae-heon?

510
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,700
Well, yes. You mean that kid
whose dream was to be an actor?

511
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,934
Well, he sent me a donation
for taking on a big role this time.

512
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,500
That's a huge amount of money.

513
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,000
Is that so?

514
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,000
Can you guess how much he donated?

515
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,767
I knew you'd be surprised.

516
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:49,533
-Saving a whole lot for himself, huh?
-Pardon me?

517
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,600
Oh, it's nothing, Sister.

518
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,266
Damn it.

519
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,633
ACCOUNT HISTORY

Thousand, ten thousand,
one million, ten million, billion!

521
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:03,800
Cash withdrawal for all of it?

522
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,367
Yes.

523
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,767
All cash, please.

AWARD - SEO YOON-HEE

525
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,066
Mom.

526
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,600
You scared me!

527
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:20,033
You told me you wouldn't be home
for three months.

528
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,600
-I just dropped by.
-You never picked up. Where have you been?

529
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:26,367
Well, I told you I'd be doing a play.

530
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,100
You could've called me back.

531
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,300
I just couldn't.

532
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,767
Have you taken any new cases?

533
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,667
I've been working on
a hotel M&A case recently.

534
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,800
It's the Nakwon Group. You know it, right?

535
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,133
Well, I've heard of it.

536
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,767
The chairwoman's condition
is quite critical.

537
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:51,400
After the chairwoman passes away,
the eldest son will sell it,

538
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,800
but the youngest of the family
seems to be against the sale.

539
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,433
Oh, really?

540
00:39:58,266 --> 00:39:59,266
I see.

541
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,834
I can't sell the 230 million-won car
because of your fingerprints on it.

542
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,433
You put a jinx on it.

543
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:09,767
Bite me!

544
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I've got to go!

545
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,800
Excuse me. How much is this car?

546
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,700
Welcome.

547
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,600
You know a lot about cars, huh?

548
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:26,266
-This car has impeccable records.
-Hey, Mr. Park.

549
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,300
Hey, Superstar Mr. Yoo.

550
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,200
It's been a while.

551
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,667
Good to see you.

552
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,967
Here's coffee for you, Superstar Mr. Yoo.

553
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,100
You're performing these days?
How's it going?

554
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,800
I'm not sure if it's going well

555
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,400
or not going well.

556
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,767
Is it sort of iffy?

557
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:50,934
Yeah, iffy.

558
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,400
Our lives are uncertain too.

559
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,433
Hey, I got paid a lot this time.

560
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,533
Well, how much could it be?

561
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:06,834
You bastard.

562
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,133
It's on me.
Have another coffee and just go.

563
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,367
Hey.

564
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,200
What's the price?

565
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,100
Why are you asking? You can't afford it.

566
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,867
I can. I'm going to buy it.

567
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:24,633
-No, you can't.
-I'm going to buy it.

568
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,767
After all this time, you talk nonsense.

569
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:29,533
-I'll buy it now.
-Stop talking nonsense.

570
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,567
I'm tired of guys like you.

571
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:34,867
You say you'll buy, but you have
terrible credit-- What's this?

572
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,800
Hey.

573
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:45,834
Isn't this enough?

574
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,934
Hey. Do you sell drugs these days?

575
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,233
Are you crazy?

576
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,133
No, I was paid in advance.
It's my money that I withdrew, my cash.

577
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:57,834
Seriously?

578
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,767
So, you selling me the car or what?

579
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:06,333
I'll take good care of you,
as our VIP customer.

580
00:42:08,266 --> 00:42:09,934
When are you getting off?

581
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,500
I just got off.

582
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,934
Let's hit the road.

583
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,867
Let's go!

584
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,567
Let's drive!

585
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,266
Let's go!

586
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,333
Everything is on me today!

587
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,066
Do whatever you want, No-kwang.

588
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,533
Let's go all the way.

589
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,166
-There's no tomorrow!
-No tomorrow!

590
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:33,867
Here you are.

591
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:37,166
Are you the top customer at this club?

592
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:40,800
Why the hell would you ask that?
You just killed the mood.

593
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:42,967
Is that a question for me now?

594
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:45,500
-Hey, Wook. Come here.
-Yes, sir.

595
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:50,300
She's asking me who the top customer is.
Answer her, please.

596
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:52,934
Well, I mean…

597
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,000
What?

598
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,800
We have first-timers tonight.

599
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,300
The guys in that VIP room are
number one today.

600
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:03,467
What?

601
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,900
Who the hell-- Let's go.

602
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:46,066
Attention!
I may not be much good for anything else,

603
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:50,166
but my pride will not allow me
to be inferior in this matter.

604
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:52,033
-Waiter.
-Yes, sir.

605
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Get me the tiger moth combo, please!
Two combos, please!

606
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:57,633
Two combos!

607
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:05,200
Thanks to my friend, I'm on cloud nine.

608
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:06,934
No-kwang.

609
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,867
Keep it down, please!

610
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:10,567
No-kwang.

611
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,066
Don't just stand there. Come over here.

612
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:15,700
Hey, Superstar Mr. Yoo.

613
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,400
What's going on? Why are you here alone?

614
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:19,467
Hey, No-kwang.

615
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,734
Excuse me. I'm sorry, girls.

616
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,800
-Please leave.
-Say what?

617
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:31,533
-That's right. I'm asking you to leave.
-Hey, it's number one.

618
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:36,133
You promised me a date.

619
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,066
Pull yourself together.

620
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,633
Mr. Park!

621
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:57,967
Please void the whole thing.
Just this once.

622
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:01,433
Please cut me some slack.
I'm begging you, please.

623
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,533
Hey!

624
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,767
Is this a game of pool?

625
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:05,900
A game of Go?

626
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:08,367
You can move a billiard ball.

627
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,133
You can move a piece in Go.

628
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:14,567
But this is a car.
You bought this. You can't take it back.

629
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:16,767
Because you said I couldn't afford it.

630
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,333
Just once, please. Just once.
Take it back, please.

631
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,333
-I'm begging you, Mr. Park.
-Damn it.

632
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:29,433
Please take the car back. Please.

633
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:31,734
Hey.

634
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,734
Look. No one knows we were in this car.

635
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,200
It's nice and clean.

636
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,100
The wheels are clean.

637
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:42,200
Can you see any scratches?
There aren't any. Please take it back.

638
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:45,266
I'm begging you. Please take it back.

639
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,266
I've already torn up the contract.

640
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,066
-What?
-Well, if you didn't hear me…

641
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:59,033
Hey, you punk.

642
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:02,266
Don't come near me. Stay away.

643
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:05,266
You rock, Mr. Park!

644
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,734
You are the best!

645
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,834
You blew my mind!

646
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,934
I'm going to deposit all of this.

647
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,667
You're depositing all of it?

648
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:20,867
Yes.

649
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:28,600
Hi, Yoon-hee. What's up?

650
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,300
Wow. I love this.

651
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:37,567
Are you ready?

652
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:39,467
Yeah.

653
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:42,333
But what for?

654
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,233
What's with you?

655
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,166
How should I know
if you're not going to explain?

656
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:50,500
What did we tell Grandma?

657
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,767
We said we'd be traveling
all over South Korea.

658
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:56,066
-Yeah.
-That means we need proof.

659
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:01,367
We need to buy souvenirs
and take pictures too.

660
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:05,166
We won't have enough evidence.
I can't believe you didn't think of this.

661
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:08,200
Where did we tell her we were going?

662
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:11,233
Sunnyland, Mt. Seoraksan…

663
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,700
Mt. Seoraksan. What else?

664
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:17,467
I think I said something
about the East Sea.

665
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:18,767
Damn it.

666
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:22,367
We don't have time to go
everywhere we mentioned.

667
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,333
I got it. Let's do this.

668
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,700
Hey, should I put it here?

669
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:36,767
Down a bit.

670
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:38,166
-Here?
-Yeah, right there.

671
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:39,900
-Right here, okay?
-Yeah.

672
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:40,967
Good.

673
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,367
Do you see what I'm doing?

674
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,133
I get it.

675
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,467
Doesn't it look like the beach
in Yangyang?

676
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Smile.

677
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,633
-Go lower.
-Like this?

678
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,700
Lower.

679
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,700
Okay, now.

680
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,533
This is good.

681
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,800
Okay. The picture came out like this.

682
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:12,000
We're not done yet. Hang on.

683
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:15,033
-What now?
-This is only the beginning.

684
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,600
What's that?

685
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:19,900
Wow.

686
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,066
You have all sorts of talents.

687
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:25,066
It's just calligraphy.

688
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:26,500
Just calligraphy.

689
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,300
What else should I draw?

690
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,200
-Draw a heart here.
-What?

691
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:37,066
It's our first trip. Draw a heart.

692
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,333
Oh, come on. A heart? Do I need to?

693
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,033
Just draw it, please. Is that so hard?

694
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,633
Hold on.

695
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,500
BLUE OCEAN IN YANGYANG

696
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,333
Are you happy now?

697
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
It's cute.

698
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:01,633
It's good, right?

699
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,734
Yeah.

700
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,734
Wait a sec.

701
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,734
Put it on. It's cute.

702
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,467
SUNNYLAND - FULL OF LOVE

703
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:22,867
HARDER TO CLIMB THAN MT. PAEKTU

704
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:24,934
Give me a tired look. One, two, three.

705
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:36,967
Hey. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

706
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:38,033
Who's calling?

707
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,967
-What do we do?
-I don't know. Do something.

708
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,734
Hello, Se-yeon.

709
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,600
Hey, Moon-seong.

710
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,800
How's the trip? Enjoying yourselves?

711
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:57,734
Yes.

712
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,533
It's amazing that there are
so many beautiful places in South Korea.

713
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,100
Right? So where are you now?

714
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,367
Jeju Island.

715
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:09,533
Well…

716
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,600
I'm…

717
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,633
on Jeju Island.

718
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:22,433
Was there such a beautiful island
at the southern end of Korea?

719
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,767
What a great view.

720
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,000
Hey, Moon-seong.

721
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:31,266
Look at this tall tree!

722
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,000
Is it called a palm tree?

723
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,700
It's so fascinating.

724
00:52:35,433 --> 00:52:38,200
I think Grandma feels lonely without you.

725
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,600
You are coming back now, right?

726
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,934
Yes, Se-yeon. We'll be there soon.

727
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,633
See you when I get back.

728
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:49,867
Thank you.

729
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:00,600
They seem to be having fun.

730
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:05,967
It would be much more fun for them
than staying home with an old woman.

731
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:08,667
They must be having
the time of their lives.

732
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:14,100
Grandma, they sent a picture from Jeju.

733
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:24,567
Did they travel like this?

734
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,767
Look at them.

735
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,200
Oh, "Grandma is like a baby,
just learning to walk."

736
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:32,734
You'd just begun to walk.

737
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:37,533
They are so cute, aren't they?

738
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,900
So cute.

739
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,000
Look at them.

740
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:43,734
ANALYSIS OF RI MOON-SEONG'S
WHEREABOUTS

741
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,767
Sang-cheol, I finally found him.

742
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:51,400
Check it out.

743
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:53,400
Can you guess where I started?

744
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:56,900
I had to get information
from a local in Yanbian

745
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,467
through the Korean-Chinese community here.

746
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,100
Sang-cheol, you don't look very enthused.

747
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,800
It was so hard to find him.

748
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,433
Okay. Good job.

749
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,533
Come on, Sang-cheol.

750
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,333
Well done. You can stop.

751
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,266
-What?
-You don't have to bring him here.

752
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,667
What the hell? What about me?

753
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:25,967
-I'll pay you the rest of the balance.
-What then?

754
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:29,834
Were you going to pay me extra,
had I brought him here?

755
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:34,133
Yes, I'll give you all that.
That settles it, right?

756
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,100
If you say so.

757
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,834
But why are you killing this job?

758
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,934
It's a shame we're stopping
after I've found him.

759
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,233
You said he's garbage.

760
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,166
Yeah, for sure.

761
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:50,967
Well, then what good is garbage?

762
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,166
That's true.

763
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,300
Let's just say…

764
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:59,433
none of this ever happened.

765
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,133
-Yes, Sang-cheol.
-See you.

It's all right now.

772
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:11,600
You've been through so much.

773
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,433
What was that?

774
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,567
Grandma.

775
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,300
Grandma.

776
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,800

Grandma?

779
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:12,233
Where are you, Grandma? Grandma?

780
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,333
Grandma?

CURTAIN CALL

783
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:55,300
Please give me some time
to put my affairs in order.

784
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:57,233
I'm helping you celebrate your first day.

785
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,567
Trust me. I'll take good care of him.

786
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:03,333
The jerks who grew up with plenty
are selfish.

787
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,800
You're so full of yourself!

788
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,333
Will he not like me?

789
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,834
He's pissing me off.

790
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,333
I'll find a way not to let him go.

791
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:13,166
Watch out!

792
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:14,367

793
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,300
Shouldn't I have brought him to the hotel?
