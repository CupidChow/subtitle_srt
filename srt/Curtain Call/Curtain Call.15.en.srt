00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,008
Hyung, you talk with him on the phone sometimes. Hurry up and give him a call.

166
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,928
- I don't know where he is, either.
- Before any of that,

167
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,468
I'd like all of us to think about it.

168
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,708
Would it be good to have

169
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,068
Rhee Moon Sung meet Grandmother right now?

170
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,268
What are you talking about?

171
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,098
Who would be the Moon Sung that Grandmother is thinking of?

172
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:09,378
Who would be better for Grandmother to meet?

173
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,168
For Grandmother, Moon Sung is-

174
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:15,658
That Moon Sung.

175
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,878
It's that Moon Sung.

176
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,918
And that's why

177
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,708
I think it would be good to call Jae Heon.

178
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,358
We can't hide the truth forever.

179
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,778
I think so, too.

180
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,858
Will you hide it until Grandmother passes away? Is that it?

181
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:29,058
No! I told you no.

182
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,198
I don't know, either.

183
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,588
Let's go.

184
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,418
Park Se Gyu!

185
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:41,388
I'm going to go for now.

186
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,698
What do we do?

187
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,048
Chairwoman.

188
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:02,138
They are coming.

189
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,358
Please rest easy.

190
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,288
Noona!

191
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,718
Noona.

192
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:49,198
What about Grandmother? Is she okay?

193
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,048
Listen carefully.

194
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,318
Today, you are Rhee Moon Sung.

195
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,408
What?

196
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,078
This is your last scene

197
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,518
acting as Rhee Moon Sung

198
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,778
in this theatrical performance.

199
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,308
You must feel so uncomfortable.

200
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,988
Should I tell them to remove this?

201
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,858
So stubborn.

202
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:27,908
Then keep it on. You need to live.

203
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,428
Let's go out,

204
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,208
so Grandmother can rest.

205
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,288
I'll be right in front.

206
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,838
Don't lift your hand. It takes energy.

207
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:05,128
You...

208
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:08,678
Oppa.

209
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,848
Grandmother.

210
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,988
I'm here.

211
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:09,608
Moon Sung.

212
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:14,498
Is it you, Moon Sung?

213
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:19,688
I almost...

214
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:24,318
just left again.

215
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,368
Leaving you behind...

216
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:33,398
without saying...

217
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:37,188
a few words of...

218
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:43,908
farewell to take care of yourself...

219
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:53,518
Grandmother...

220
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,008
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:40,248
I'm sorry, Grandmother. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

222
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:43,388
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

223
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:45,648
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

224
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,298
I am...

225
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,878
sorry that I am not Rhee Moon Sung.

226
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:03,078
You are not...

227
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,048
Rhee Moon Sung?

228
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:11,708
I'm sorry...

229
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:20,658
I already knew.

230
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,268
At a certain moment,

231
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,858
I found out.

232
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,608
That...

233
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:40,968
you are not...

234
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:44,338
Rhee Moon Sung.

235
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:49,348
Still,

236
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:55,138
I was able to see

237
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,268
how much you cared,

238
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:05,018
how much all of you cared about me,

239
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,978
so...

240
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:12,128
I pretended not to know.

241
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:24,088
Child.

242
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,248
What...

243
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:33,508
is your name?

244
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,988
My name is Yoo Jae Heon. Yoo Jae Heon.

245
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,028
Oh, I see.

246
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:46,458
It's Jae Heon.

247
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,038
Yes...

248
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,408
And your job?

249
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,538
I am an actor.

250
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,688
An actor...

251
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,528
I tried acting

252
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:14,128
for the first time in my life...

253
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:16,808
How was it?

254
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,938
Was it decent?

255
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,468
Yes.

256
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:29,218
While acting like

257
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:33,578
I didn't know in front of you guys,

258
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,708
I had this thought.

259
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:44,378
Acting like I didn't know when I knew...

260
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:49,748
Acting like I was happy when I wasn't...

261
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:52,308
Acting like I was okay...

262
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:55,528
even when I was in pain...

263
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:01,898
It turns out I, too,

264
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:06,278
was an actor.

265
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,358
Don't be...

266
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:16,058
too hard on yourself.

267
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,968
This grandmother

268
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:24,108
was happy...

269
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:27,728
because of you guys.

270
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:30,398
T-This is...

271
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,948
my...

272
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:37,498
honest truth.

273
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:39,538
Grandmother...

274
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:41,518
Grandmother, me, too.

275
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,398
I was happy, too.

276
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,488
I was happy, Grandmother.

277
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,808
There's something called a curtain call, Grandmother. A curtain call.

278
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,968
In a theatrical performance, when the performance is over,

279
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:02,228
a curtain call is when the actors thank the audience for coming to watch.

280
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,328
Grandmother, you need to

281
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,918
thank the people in the theatrical performance of your life.

282
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,858
You need to do your curtain call.

283
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:13,898
Curtain...

284
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:16,788
call?

285
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,468
Grandmother,

286
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:25,068
there is...

287
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:28,088
something I really want to

288
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,488
show you, Grandmother.

289
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,778
It is...

290
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:40,818
the only thing that I can show you, Grandmother.

291
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,988
You're going to come to see it for sure, right?

292
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,588
Grandmother, you will come and see it, right?

293
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:51,038
I will...

294
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:55,708
for sure...

295
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,818
Grandmother.

296
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:01,588
Grandmother?

297
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:02,588
Grandmother, wait!

298
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:03,778
Grandmother!

299
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:06,238
Grandmother!

300
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:13,138
What am I supposed to do? Grandmother!

301
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,398
Oh, no, what... What do I do...

302
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:24,298
Grandmother...

303
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:29,208
What's wrong?

304
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,538
You can't come in.

305
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,088
Please wait here.

306
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,318
Please leave.

307
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:35,098
Check her vitals.

308
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,698
How is it? Is it normal?

309
00:21:57,478 --> 00:22:00,198
What did you do?

310
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:01,708
Oppa!

311
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:38,028
Did you know...

312
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,918
Grandmother knew everything?

313
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,558
I see...

314
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:51,718
Yeah.

315
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,698
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.

316
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:58,438
She said she was happy because of us.

317
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:02,528
So we shouldn't torment ourselves.

318
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,718
Did she really say that?

319
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,488
Yoon Hee.

320
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:13,178
There is one thing I didn't get to do.

321
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:16,708
I think...

322
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,598
I really need to do this.

323
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:26,778
How is Grandmother?

324
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:36,558
Lady Se Yeon...

325
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,868
How's Grandmother?

326
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,448
Did you know?

327
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,988
This huge house was completely empty. There's only one reason for that.

328
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:06,538
It's not like there were multiple reasons.

329
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:12,598
She's okay for now.

330
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:21,638
I would like for you to let me know next time.

331
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:23,788
Even though you guys may be strangers to me,

332
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:26,258
Grandmother is not.

333
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,748
Yes, Manager.

334
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,378
It's me.

335
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,908
Where are you?

336
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:04,308
I'm home.

337
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:06,328
Then Jae Heon,

338
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,578
let's have a drink together.

339
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:25,118
I'm reminded of when we first started this performance here.

340
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:27,648
<i>While we were taking the passport photos...</i>

341
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:29,348
<i>One, two, three.</i>

342
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:31,868
<i>we were just enjoying ourselves,</i>

343
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,528
thinking that the performance will turn out well.

344
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,168
Because of that memory, it's really tough right now

345
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,028
and it's painful.

346
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,788
Jae Heon.

347
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:47,528
I started...

348
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:51,208
this performance.

349
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,168
Come on.

350
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,498
It's what the two of us started.

351
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:57,828
No.

352
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:02,608
It was the first and last reckless bravado of my life

353
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:04,868
and a tantrum.

354
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:06,608
In any case,

355
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,488
thanks for being with me through it.

356
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,988
I mean, the guarantee

357
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,728
was ridiculously good.

358
00:26:16,428 --> 00:26:18,158
So...

359
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:19,638
do you still have

360
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:20,888
some of that money left?

361
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:24,308
That money...

362
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,138
Where did it go?

363
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:31,968
In any case,

364
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:35,748
for sticking with me through it, thank you...

365
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:37,638
and I'm sorry.

366
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:40,508
Grandmother...

367
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:43,678
knew everything.

368
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:48,078
Even though she knew everything, she pretended not to know.

369
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:51,578
Why do you think she did that?

370
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:56,838
It's because she knew

371
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:59,538
with what kind of heart

372
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:02,008
you started all of this, Manager.

373
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:06,408
Grandmother understood, Manager.

374
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,808
You told me this once, Manager.

375
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,278
If the other person

376
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:16,048
doesn't know that something is a lie to the end,

377
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,648
then it wouldn't be a lie.

378
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,368
But...

379
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,788
sometimes,

380
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:25,068
even when the other person knows it's a lie,

381
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:28,188
it is still not a lie.

382
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,488
So...

383
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:34,908
Manager ahjussi,

384
00:27:34,908 --> 00:27:37,868
don't torture yourself too much.

385
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,288
Thanks.

386
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,778
Jae Heon.

387
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,578
Let's have a drink.

388
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:50,078
Yes.

389
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:31,198
I have a request to make.

390
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:35,228
Help me to meet Rhee Moon Sung once.

391
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,518
Oh, Attorney.

392
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:54,798
Oh, yes.

393
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:59,278
If you're here regarding the Chairwoman's inheritance issue,

394
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,498
none of the family members are here, so come back at a later time...

395
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,708
No.

396
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,778
I came to see the two of you today.

397
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:14,888
There are no changes with regard to the inheritance or the shares.

398
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,128
Please get things ready, so we can

399
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:20,698
proceed with the sales process as soon as we finish the legal review.

400
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,878
When we are ready to finalize the sale,

401
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:24,558
I'll let you know right away.

402
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,138
The fake...

403
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:34,048
will pass onto Se Yeon unconditionally

404
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,978
everything he receives from his grandmother.

405
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:40,078
And even though she knows he's fake,

406
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,828
Se Yeon will go along

407
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:45,298
with the performance to protect the hotel.

408
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,138
But if the real cousin were to appear at that moment?

409
00:29:56,478 --> 00:30:00,078
I'm curious to know the real Rhee Moon Sung's decision.

410
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,808
That's why I asked you to meet with me,

411
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:05,908
the real Rhee Moon Sung.

412
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,408
There's no reason for me to tell you

413
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,258
just because you're curious.

414
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:13,338
This is South Korea.

415
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,578
It's different from North Korea, where you used to live.

416
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,178
Nothing is free in capitalism.

417
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:43,588
My answer is simple.

418
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,388
If I can just destroy this hotel and cause...

419
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,238
Grandmother to fall into despair,

420
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:52,198
then I would side with anyone

421
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:55,088
and do whatever it takes.

422
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,408
So...

423
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,268
was that a good enough answer for you,

424
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:01,548
you curious man?

425
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:07,078
So what are you going to do,

426
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:08,908
Park Se Yeon?

427
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:18,228
<i>You know Rhee Moon Sung is on my side, right?</i>

428
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:21,738
<i>No matter what you do now, you can't stop me.</i>

429
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:55,988
Rhee Moon Sung.

430
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,588
Come outside with me for a bit.

431
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:02,478
Isn't it polite to state your business first?

432
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:04,028
It's not me,

433
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:06,838
but someone else wants to meet with you.

434
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:22,998
You guys have your conversation.

435
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,828
Thank you.

436
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:41,588
We met last time, right?

437
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,228
Yeah.

438
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,828
I remember.

439
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,878
You were that compatriot.

440
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:50,658
Yes, well... Compatriot...

441
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:54,458
Thinking about it,

442
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,178
I guess our acquaintance is a bit weird

443
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:58,708
since I met Rhee Moon Sung

444
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,498
as Rhee Moon Sung.

445
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:04,778
Since Rhee Moon Sung and Rhee Moon Sung met...

446
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,248
My name is Yoo Jae Heon.

447
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,488
My name is Seo Yoon Hee.

448
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,908
What business do you have with me?

449
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:25,468
I had something to talk to you about.

450
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:27,258
Something to talk about?

451
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:31,588
Something to talk about, you say...

452
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:36,498
Everyone who wants to see me in South Korea

453
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:40,698
all ask me to do something or not do something...

454
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:43,088
and then they give me money...

455
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:48,058
after only saying what they've got to say.

456
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:52,038
Nobody really cares about what I want.

457
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:59,038
A capitalist society is truly different.

458
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,828
Don't you think so?

459
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:04,468
So...

460
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:07,688
did you guys...

461
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,178
come carrying piles of cash? Yeah?

462
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:14,608
What do you want me to do for you?

463
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,498
Tell me about it.

464
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,398
I wanted to tell you about Grandmother.

465
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:24,528
What?

466
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:27,398
I ended up spending the time with Grandmother

467
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,678
that you should have in your place.

468
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:32,258
I thought it would be good to tell you about

469
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:36,238
how my time with Grandmother was.

470
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:39,298
The time that you should have spent with her...

471
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:42,138
Aren't you curious about it?

472
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:58,108
What is this?

473
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,368
Grandmother...

474
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,408
built the hotel by selling rice soup like this.

475
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:09,308
I guess your grandfather told her

476
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,478
that he'll come to find her and to wait for him.

477
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,328
Since all she knew how to do was make rice soup,

478
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,068
so she waited for him

479
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,318
selling this rice soup.

480
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:24,598
When I first came to this house,

481
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:27,978
Grandmother personally made this rice soup for me.

482
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,768
It was so good.

483
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:37,418
I guess she really wanted to have you try

484
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:41,098
the rice soup she personally made, Rhee Moon Sung.

485
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:43,948
So...

486
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,028
try it.

487
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,658
- You eat, too.
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,908
How is it?

489
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:39,868
Isn't it really good?

490
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,828
So, what about you?

491
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:02,248
Excuse me?

492
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:07,368
If this comrade is me, then who are you?

493
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:12,228
Well, I am...

494
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,898
If he's Rhee Moon Sung,

495
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,498
then I am...

496
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:22,048
Jang Jin Sook.

497
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,408
Your wife...

498
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,328
Well, your wife...

499
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,868
The one you're married to...

500
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:30,378
Well, the thing is...

501
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,988
For Grandmother-

502
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,128
My wife is...

503
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:54,848
not ugly like this girl.

504
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:00,538
She's way more feminine and beautiful.

505
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,418
Wow, you speak really funny, don't you?

506
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,178
What's wrong with me in any way?

507
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,908
A bunch of guys on the other side of the globe says they like me! Okay?

508
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:21,118
You sprayed food everywhere.

509
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:22,598
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:44,195
Do you remember this moment?

511
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,255
A bit.

512
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,183
You were cute when you were younger

513
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:57,223
even though there's no trace of that cuteness left now.

514
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:01,573
What?

515
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:09,073
Grandmother's hands that I held then...

516
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,733
<i>That touch...</i>

517
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:15,053
♫ <i>In the breaking tides</i> ♫

518
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,213
Although I don't remember the rest,

519
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,193
I remember that touch.

520
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:30,543
♫ <i>Like a boulder, I remain here</i> ♫

521
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:36,543
♫ <i>Remembering you from that day</i> ♫

522
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,383
He was the first customer to stay a night.

523
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:44,343
I guess he came to see her multiple times over the years.

524
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:48,113
Even though he knew that Grandmother

525
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:51,093
was waiting there for her family to return,

526
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:54,613
he was someone who protected and loved her.

527
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:04,173
♫ <i>You are cold like the sea</i> ♫

528
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:10,123
♫ <i>Seeming distant though not so</i> ♫

529
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:23,173
♫ <i>Whenever I approach you, you begin to disappear slowly</i> ♫

530
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:29,403
♫ <i>Remembering you from that day</i> ♫

531
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:36,063
♫ <i>In the breaking tides</i> ♫

532
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:41,283
♫ <i>In my wounded state, like a boulder...</i> ♫

533
00:40:58,093 --> 00:41:00,163
Moon Sung...

534
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:15,643
Have you been well, Co-sister-in-law?

535
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:18,113
Oh, right.

536
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:24,053
What am I supposed to call you now?

537
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:25,803
Unni.

538
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:43,553
Hey, get in.

539
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,513
Hey.

540
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:02,813
Wear your seat belt.

541
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,573
The thing next to you. Pull it down and fasten it.

542
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:15,023
But why are you speaking without honorifics?

543
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:16,583
You spoke to me that way from the beginning.

544
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,953
What?

545
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:20,463
Hey.

546
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:22,213
Our ages are similar...

547
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:24,533
and come on, do we have an ordinary relationship?

548
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,833
Our relationship is special.

549
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:30,333
Kind of like a hermaphrodite of sorts?

550
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,303
I can drop the honorifics, right?

551
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:36,243
Hey, come on. People of similar ages drop honorifics and become friends.

552
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,773
I've done my research.

553
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:38,883
You guys do that in North Korea, too.

554
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:41,523
They say it's the same in South Korea and North Korea. It's the same everywhere.

555
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:44,743
You're quite the funny one, aren't you?

556
00:42:44,743 --> 00:42:46,333
Look at this guy.

557
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:50,463
I've already finished analyzing a character like you.

558
00:42:50,463 --> 00:42:51,693
You muttering like that?

559
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,573
That means approval.

560
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:54,743
Isn't that right?

561
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,233
No?

562
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:58,053
Let's go.

563
00:42:58,053 --> 00:42:59,443
Where?

564
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:08,503
I wanted to tell you the truth,

565
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:12,483
but I'm sorry you had to find out like this, Unni.

566
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:15,693
When I first learned that you were a fake,

567
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:21,663
do you know what the first thought that came to mind was?

568
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,643
What a shame...

569
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,413
that I have to lose a close friend.

570
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,663
Did I...

571
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:36,073
lose you?

572
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,713
No, Unni.

573
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:41,553
I want to continue to have a close relationship with you, Unni.

574
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:42,793
Really?

575
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:45,043
Yes.

576
00:43:46,063 --> 00:43:47,703
Then...

577
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,033
could you tell me your number?

578
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:57,043
- Yes.
- Your number, your number.

579
00:43:57,043 --> 00:43:59,143
- Right here.
- Me, too.

580
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:01,483
But isn't this so weird?

581
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:04,823
I thought we got as close as we could,

582
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:09,233
but I don't know anything about you.

583
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,483
That's true...

584
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:12,633
Tell me about you.

585
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,733
Excuse me?

586
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,223
Who are you?

587
00:44:15,223 --> 00:44:17,583
Who are you?

588
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:20,253
Who are you? Huh?

589
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,073
I don't know where to start.

590
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,663
I want to know everything from the very beginning.

591
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,933
From A to Z, all of it.

592
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:47,993
Just in case

593
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,773
you guys might come,

594
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:55,013
she supposedly came here whenever she got the chance

595
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:57,173
for several decades.

596
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:01,623
She always imagined here

597
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:03,583
you crossing the sea,

598
00:45:04,463 --> 00:45:07,823
coming in on a boat over the horizon.

599
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:12,783
I know.

600
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:35,513
<i>Can't you come with us?</i>

601
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:38,333
<i>Moon Sung.</i>

602
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,123
<i>Next year,</i>

603
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:43,563
<i>let's meet here again, no matter what.</i>

604
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:46,673
<i>Let's promise.</i>

605
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:48,353
<i>Like this...</i>

606
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:57,153
<i>Grandma, we're going to meet again.</i>

607
00:45:57,153 --> 00:45:59,183
<i>My name is Rhee Moon Sung.</i>

608
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:01,213
<i>Don't forget, okay?</i>

609
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:25,713
All right. Cheers.

610
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:41,623
What are you doing? Drink!

611
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,543
Oh, you're...

612
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,763
not good...

613
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,903
with alcohol, huh?

614
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,363
Aigoo...

615
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:56,293
you look like you would chug a crate or two.

616
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,223
Kind of cute, aren't you?

617
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:03,333
If you're not going to drink it, then I will!

618
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:37,803
Here!

619
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:44,983
How did you end up doing it?

620
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:51,273
- What do you mean?
- Acting as me.

621
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:53,173
How did you end up doing it?

622
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:55,503
It is so that

623
00:47:57,783 --> 00:47:59,073
we can make...

624
00:47:59,073 --> 00:48:02,223
It's to make Grandmother happy.

625
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,333
Is that the only reason?

626
00:48:08,543 --> 00:48:10,313
This is...

627
00:48:10,313 --> 00:48:12,643
something I'm only telling you.

628
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:16,483
I've told nobody else about this!

629
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:18,383
Nobody!

630
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:23,613
You bastard,

631
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,373
you lived with your father.

632
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:32,103
I...

633
00:48:33,563 --> 00:48:36,973
don't even know my parents' faces.

634
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:43,733
<i>In an amusement park,</i>

635
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:45,523
<i>I remember...</i>

636
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:49,163
<i>sitting all alone.</i>

637
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,543
That feeling.

638
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:54,773
Geez, it's so annoying, but that's all I remember.

639
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:56,633
And so,

640
00:48:57,743 --> 00:49:02,563
I wondered what it would feel like

641
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:05,043
to reunite with your long-lost family.

642
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:07,803
That's what I was curious about.

643
00:49:07,803 --> 00:49:09,283
But, just a tad bit...

644
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,993
I think I'm able to know

645
00:49:13,473 --> 00:49:15,223
just a little bit.

646
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:23,843
Stop drinking.

647
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:25,923
Fine.

648
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,253
I won't, I won't!

649
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,613
For me.

650
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:35,243
For you.

651
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:38,013
For the two

652
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:39,983
Rhee Moon Sungs.

653
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:41,413

Don't hate...

You bastard.

662

Geez, let go! I can walk by myself. I can walk.

When you starve to the point where you have no strength

755
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:44,213
to recover a dead body floating down the river

Are you telling me that the morons who rack their brains to eat something tastier

760
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:05,783
could tell us that we should live upright

even if we have to eat dirt?

762

Does that make any sense?

763
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:16,433
If the remaining three months of a 92-year-old grandmother are so precious,

how would I feel about a woman, who's less than 30 years old,

765
