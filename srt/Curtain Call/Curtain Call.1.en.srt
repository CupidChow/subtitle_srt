1950 DECEMBER
23RD HEUNGNAM DOCK

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,433
-Hurry!
-Quick!

3
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:51,367
-Slow down, son!
-Father, hurry!

4
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,900
Son, leave everything.
Just grab the important things.

5
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:56,967
Get moving!

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,367
Why are we rushing?

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,467
The airborne troops are coming.
Miss the US military ship, we're dead.

8
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,166
-Let's hurry!
-Come on out already!

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,667
-Come on!
-Don't throw that away that's--

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,567
We must survive first!

11
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:15,000
Get Mother! Hurry up!

12
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,166
Yeong-hoon.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you cold?

14
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:33,333
I'm fine.
I'm just worried about Yeong-hoon.

15
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:35,967
Don't worry about him.

16
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:40,400
He's Ja Geum-sun, your son.
This is nothing for him.

17
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,300
Huh, what is that?

18
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,166
People are already on the ship.

19
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,066
-What if we miss it!
-Hurry, let's go!

20
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:59,433
Why were we the last to know?
We live the closest. Hurry!

21
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,934
-Hurry!
-Let's go!

22
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,867
Let's go, Geum-sun.

23
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,266
Don't do this! We're one of you!

24
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,100
Please, open the gates!

25
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,100
Move out of the way!

26
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,767
Out, out!

27
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,000
The gates are open!

28
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,333
Stay close, Geum-sun.

29
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,934
If by any chance, we lose each other--

30
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:44,200
Don't talk like that.
Don't you remember how we became a family?

31
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,767
You're right.

32
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,300
Let's go.

33
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,266
Cheol-jin! Cheol-jin!

34
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:40,500
Grandma!

35
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:43,967
Grandma!

36
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,266
Don't do it.

37
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,233
Geum-sun, keep going.

38
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
No!

39
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,533
Jong-mun!

40
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,767
Stop!

41
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,266
Jong-mun!

42
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,300
-Oh, no!
-What are you doing?

43
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,767
Grandma!

44
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,467
Hang on tight!

45
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,934
Come on up! Hurry!

46
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,000
Cheol-jin!

47
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,700
Raise the anchor!

48
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,333
-Cheol-jin.
-Here you are.

49
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,700
-Grandma.
-Cheol-jin.

50
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,300
You got it!

51
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,400
Give me your hand. Your hand.

52
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,533
I got you! Cheol-jin.

53
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,367
Cheol-jin, my baby.

54
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,200
Thank you!

55
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,133
Jong-mun, get on!

56
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Jong-mun!

57
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,367
Jong-mun!

58
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,867
Grab on!

59
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,000
Hang on tight!

60
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,567
-Hang tight!
-Geum-sun! Geum-sun!

61
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,166
-Jong-mun!
-Survive!

62
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,934
-You must survive!
-No, don't!

63
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,900
You have to survive!

64
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,500
Don't!

65
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,734
No!

66
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,567
Jong-mun!

67
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Are you okay?

68
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,867
Yeong-hoon!

69
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,734
Yeong-hoon!

70
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,166
Let's go, Cheol-jin.

71
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,533
NAKWON INN

72
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,166
-Excuse me, miss.
-Yes?

73
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,533
-More makgeolli, please.
-One minute.

74
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:19,533
Thank you.

75
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,100
Are you from the north?

76
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,533
How did you know?

77
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,934
You're looking far off into the sea.

78
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,734
How can I not know?

79
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,567
Goodbye.

80
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,333
Hurry, pack up. Don't you want to go home?

81
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,600
All right. Just one more drink.

82
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,433
EPISODE 1

83
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,900
THE NAKWON HOTEL

84
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,600
"I want to provide a refuge
for those who lost their homeland."

85
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:35,500
Our founder Ja Geum-sun
named our hotel 'Nakwon,'

86
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:39,200
hoping to provide a paradise for those

87
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,233
who meandered with
the painful memories of war.

88
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:48,400
She never lost that hope and worked hard
to make this a paradise for all.

89
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:52,066
With 15 branches nationwide,
Nakwon Group's legacy will continue

90
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,200
as South Korea's
most historical hotel chain.

91
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:59,500
As we continue to pursue
the hopes of our founder.

92
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:04,667
Tomorrow, 'The Hotel Nakwon' will launch
in the hopes to become a paradise

93
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,967
for those around the world.

94
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,467
Get Hoseong Gallery on the line.

95
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,100
This piece by Mr. Jo.
It isn't the one from the exhibit, is it?

96
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,900
This course meal provides
the smallest portions of food.

97
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,000
Customers these days
are more environmentally aware.

98
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,667
As service providers,
creating less food waste

99
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,533
is one of the ESG frameworks
we need to practice.

100
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,867
It won't be easy, but please be mindful.

101
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,700
Good morning.

102
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,333
Whether it be luggages from taxis,

103
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,667
or luggages from luxury cars.

104
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,033
Whether it be a 2.8 million won carrier,

105
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,834
or a 28,000 won student backpack.

106
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,467
We treat them all the same.

107
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,567
Don't forget this, everyone.

108
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,033
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:01,567
Hey, sweetie.

110
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,900
Wow.

111
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,066
That was a hard punch.

112
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,867
I told you to stop that.

113
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,767
But it's so fun.

114
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,533
Strangers will think
I'm the perfect boyfriend.

115
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,233
-And the people who know us?
-Even better. I'll look pathetic.

116
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:28,533
Wow, so this is really our hotel?

117
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,767
My hotel.

118
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,333
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

119
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,700
Why are you really here?

120
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,367
Obviously, I'm here to congratulate you.

121
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,100
Then attend tomorrow's event.

122
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,533
I can't stand events.

123
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,734
Our brother will attend anyway.

124
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,000
Se-yeon.

125
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,934
I've been meaning to say this.

126
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,734
You are so awesome.

127
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,934
I mean it.

128
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
You made your dream hotel into reality.

129
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,834
Grandma needs to see this, too.

130
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,200
Even visits aren't allowed.
They need her kept stable.

131
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,133
She can't come.

132
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,133
Yeong-hoon.

133
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,834
Yeong-hoon.

134
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,300
Yeong-hoon.

135
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,133
Yeong-hoon.

136
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,166
Yeong-hoon.

137
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,867
Yeong-hoon.

138
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:06,867
Yeong-hoon.

139
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,667
Yeong-hoon, Yeong-hoon.

140
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,000
-Yeong-hoon, Yeong-hoon.
-Calm down.

141
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,900
-Jong-mun, Jong-mun.
-You're okay.

142
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,533
So scary.

143
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,333
-Jong-mun.
-Chairwoman.

144
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,033
-Jong-mun.

145
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,000
Chairwoman Ja.

146
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:01,133
It would be best
for you to rest some more.

147
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,266
How long do I have?

148
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,433
Sorry?

149
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,133
You have about three months left.

150
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Mr. Jeong, I'd like to go home.

151
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,967
-Let's go home.
-Ma'am.

152
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,567
Jeong-suk, get ready.

153
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,467
Sir, shall we go?

154
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:27,633
Se-gyu.

155
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,100
You said you weren't coming. What's up?

156
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,834
Haven't you heard?

157
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,033
Ms. Park!

158
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:40,300
Ms. Park, something's happened.

159
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,700
-Today--
-Today what?

160
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,800
There will be an emergency board meeting.

161
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,166
Let us begin the emergency board meeting

162
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,367
to discuss the liquidation
of Nakwon Hotel Group.

163
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,033
As you all know--

164
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,266
What did you say?

165
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,200
Mr. Kim.

166
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:20,200
How can you assemble a meeting
without my approval?

167
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,433
Especially, about the hotel's liquidation?

168
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:28,367
We already sent a letter of notice.
I guess you didn't check your mailbox.

169
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,133
Should we have sent an email instead?

170
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,266
Anyway, we notified you.

171
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,066
If you missed it, that's too bad.

172
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,400
You find this funny?

173
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:46,133
I'm this hotel's
third largest shareholder,

174
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,467
and you discuss liquidations without me?

175
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,266
Does this make sense?

176
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,900
Yes, it does.

177
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:59,133
The group's largest shareholder
Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun is very ill.

178
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:03,133
That brings us to
our second largest shareholder

179
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,400
Mr. Park Se-jun.

180
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,266
Mr. Park is the one who pursued
the liquidation deal

181
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,133
with the world-renowned
Bilton Hotel Group.

182
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,133
Now do you understand?

183
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,033
After the initial assessments,

184
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,700
all necessary adjustments
for the liquidation will be made.

185
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,133
What he is saying… is it true?

186
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,367
Well,

187
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,333
The Chairwoman, who is hospitalized
due to her chronic illness

188
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:42,333
is considered incapable of
any proper decision making--

189
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,333
The Chairwoman is here.

190
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:31,700
NAKWON HOTEL
EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING

191
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Chairwoman, how did you--

192
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Ma'am, are you… how is your health?

193
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,934
Why? Are you disappointed
because I'm not dead?

194
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,333
Oh, no. How could I possibly…

195
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,300
Well, I'm craving some coffee
since it's been so long.

196
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,467
The hospital wouldn't let me drink coffee.

197
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,600
Seong-do, make me some coffee, will you?

198
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,333
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

199
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,066
Miss Yeo, get her some coffee.

200
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,333
-Yes, sir.
-What are you doing?

201
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm sorry?

202
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,367
I asked you to make coffee, not that girl.

203
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,367
Me?

204
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,166
For the first twenty years
of your work here

205
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,500
you were in charge of my coffee, remember?

206
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,233
Don't act weird now.

207
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:32,367
Ma'am, many eyes are on us now.

208
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,200
I want to drink the your coffee.

209
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:42,233
Cream and sugar.
You know what I like, right?

210
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,567
A two-two-one ratio.

211
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:46,667
Get me that.

212
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,667
I'll be right back.

213
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,300
If I may,
I'd like to have my coffee with my family.

214
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,500
It's been over a month
since I saw my grandchildren.

215
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,934
-Grandma.
-I'm all right.

216
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,433
How have you been?

217
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:27,266
You look beautiful today.

218
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Look at all these trinkets.
Why don't you dress your age?

219
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:36,633
-Get it together.
-Man, this again?

220
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,100
Park Se-gyu. Get over here.

221
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,266
Saying "Get over here,"
what does that ever do?

222
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:47,033
-I guess you're well enough to nag.
-Se-gyu.

223
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,066
I see your high-pitched voice is the same.

224
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,834
Bam, here. Goodbye. I'm gone!

225
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,266
Oh, that child.

226
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,633
He looks like some goblin.

227
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,400
Tastes bland.

228
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,133
Ma'am?

229
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Your coffee used to taste delicious.

230
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
It always tasted delicious too.

231
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,533
It was pretty amazing.

232
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:43,300
Maybe my taste buds have changed.

233
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:47,367
Or are you the one who's changed?

234
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm sorry, ma'am.

235
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,700
Forgive me.

236
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,533
We must get going
as we need to take care of some things.

237
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:02,433
I'm worried you'll ruin your health
by straining yourself like this.

238
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,066
Please take care of her.

239
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,066
Sir.

240
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,233
I really didn't know.

241
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,433
She wasn't in the state to leave
the hospital.

242
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,767
I don't understand.

243
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,233
If she takes back her position,
the liquidation plans will have to stop.

244
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,633
-Let's keep it going.
-Sir?

245
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,400
We just need to adjust our schedule.

246
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:50,400
My dream was to make a hotel
anyone could see from afar

247
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:55,500
like a lighthouse by the horizon.

248
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,533
And you made that happen.

249
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:05,433
Thank you.

250
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,500
Let's talk details at home.

251
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:16,100
Today's a busy day for you.
Go take care of business.

252
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,133
-You're not going to the hospital?
-I'm not going back there.

253
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,000
Grandma, you can't do that.

254
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,600
Se-yeon.

255
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,500
Chairwoman, shall we get going?

256
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes.

257
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,367
Are you okay?

258
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,600
Let's go.

259
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,100
CHAIRWOMAN JA GEUM-SUN ILL

260
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,233
NAKWON GROUP,
SUCCESSION OR LIQUIDATION?

261
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:18,734
CHAIRWOMAN DEATH RUMORS

262
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:20,600
CHAIRMAN JA GEUM-SUN
TERMINALLY ILL

263
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,300
UNDER THE QUEEN'S UMBRELLA

264
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,967
THE CHAEBOL SUCCESSION WAR BEGINS

265
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:30,166
In order for Nakwon
to become a global brand,

266
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:33,333
I think we must proceed with this deal.

267
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,533
So the Nakwon Hotel liquidation
is really happening?

268
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,667
I can't say for sure
until anything is concrete.

269
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,567
Since Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun
founded Nakwon Group

270
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:48,166
we are proud to have kept our name

271
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,767
as the Koreas' largest hotel chain.

272
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:53,300
That fact won't change.

273
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:55,867
Then what about the liquidation deal?

274
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,800
We won't be liquidating ever.

275
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,233
What? Liquidation?

276
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,433
Answer me, at least.

277
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,567
We won't be looking into that ever.
Is that good enough for you?

278
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:12,600
Then what will you be looking into?

279
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,734
You?

280
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:20,633
Mr. Kim

281
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:23,633
Bilton will need to speed up
the paperwork process.

282
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,700
If unnecessary rumors spread,

283
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:29,133
it would be disadvantageous
to both selling and buying parties.

284
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:34,667
Yes, as quickly as possible.

285
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,834
CHAIRWOMAN JA TERMINALLY ILL

286
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,700
LIQUIDATION OR SUCCESSION
IN THE WORKS?

287
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,467
OLD BOY

288
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,500
I think I might be lucky enough
to get ten today.

289
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,033
Coffee delivery orders, please.

290
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:53,900
Four cups of coffee!

291
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,467
Over here.

292
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,767
THE NATIONAL GARDEN

293
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,700
A STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP

294
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,900
A STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP

295
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:21,734
Another busy day.

296
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:25,867
A STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP

297
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:30,100
How very handsome.

298
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,033
What's with the shakiness?

299
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,834
Maybe you're working too much?

300
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
FRIENDSHIP THEATER GROUP

301
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:54,767
Yes, that feels good.

302
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:58,800
It's because bike riding isn't exercise
but labor.

303
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,333
FRIENDSHIP THEATER GROUP

304
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,200
If you bike ride until your legs give out

305
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,934
you might get prostate issues, no?

306
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,266
Wow, you're so weak.

307
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,367
Hey, my prostate is fine.

308
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,734
WE ARE ONE BLOOD,
ONE PEOPLE, ONE HEART

309
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:52,533
-Over there, over there.
-Where, where?

310
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,934
2002, THE 4TH DISPERSED
FAMILY REUNION

311
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,433
-Mom!
-Mother!

312
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,834
WE ARE ONE BLOOD,
ONE PEOPLE, ONE HEART

313
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,967
Oh, Father.

314
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,834
-My son!
-Father!

315
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:14,266
FAMILY REUNION: RI YEONG-HOON,
RI MOON-SEONG, JA GEUM-SUN

316
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Mother.

317
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,166
Are you…

318
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:34,633
It's Yeong-hoon.

319
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,166
You're Yeong-hoon?

320
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,033
Yeong-hoon.

321
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:51,166
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

322
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,567
It's been a long time.

323
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:03,767
Don't cry.

324
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,033
Hi there.

325
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,867
This is Moon-seong.

326
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,767
This feels like a dream.

327
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:23,400
How did it come to this?

328
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,934
I can die happy now.

329
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,867
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR REUNION

330
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,033
WE ARE ONE BLOOD,
ONE PEOPLE, ONE HEART

331
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,133
There.

332
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,967
Does Moon-seong look like Father so much?

333
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,867
That's right.

334
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,367
I first met your father
when he was about this age.

335
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,900
Father was six years younger than you,

336
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,066
so you must have quite a clear memory.

337
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:04,100
You're the spitting image
of your father's face

338
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,567
when he became older.

339
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,700
I'm not as handsome as Father.

340
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:15,500
Mother, you look exactly like
how Father described you.

341
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm sure I don't look exactly the same.
I'm a grandmother now.

342
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:20,934
No, really.

343
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,700
Your eyes, your mouth.

344
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,600
Father told me about you every day,
so I knew it was you immediately.

345
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,133
I see.

346
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,500
Father missed you so much.

347
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:40,033
Our neighbors constantly told him
he should remarry,

348
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:41,533
but he never budged.

349
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,433
I see.

350
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,934
That sounds like your father.

351
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:54,300
But I couldn't do the same.

352
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,967
Upon reunification,
go and apologize to Father at his grave.

353
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,667
I'm sure he'll accept your apology.

354
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:06,567
Yes. Of course.

355
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:10,033
When we reunify,
let's build a house near Father's grave--

356
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,200
If reunification happens,
you'll never have to worry about a thing.

357
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,834
Moon-seong, you'll be able to do anything,

358
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:22,400
learn anything, and buy anything you want.

359
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,800
There are so many things in Seoul
that you would love.

360
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:32,166
Mother, you won't be returning
to your hometown then?

361
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,467
Well, things are better in South Korea
to raise children--

362
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
No thank you.

363
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:49,133
I see. I've made a mistake.

364
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,834
It's not a mistake, is it?

365
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,133
Because you married another man,

366
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,700
and had children and grandchildren
with him.

367
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,033
It's a good thing Father passed early.

368
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,133
Yeong-hoon.

369
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,834
Father uttered your name
until his last breath.

370
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,100
Not a day went by
that I didn't think of him.

371
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:35,266
Not only do you look alike,
but you have his personality, too.

372
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:41,233
How is it that you look so much
like your grandfather?

373
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,367
Yeong-hoon.

374
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,300
The man I married in South Korea

375
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,700
died young after we had our son.

376
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,133
But our son and his wife

377
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,333
have already passed away.

378
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,266
The only reason I withstood
such a punishing life

379
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,166
was because of my grandchildren
who lost their parents.

380
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,166
You…

381
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,133
Your father…

382
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,300
I've never forgotten for a single day.

383
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,567
I don't need that.

384
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,166
You have to take it.

385
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm so old that cancer cells
are growing old with me.

386
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:19,800
They aren't as strong.

387
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,200
I'm fine without the medicine.

388
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
How about a visit to the hospital?

389
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,333
I could live another year
if I get hospitalized.

390
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,400
I could live three months
if I live here freely.

391
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:40,800
Which would you choose, Mr. Jung?

392
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,200
I'd like to see you healthy

393
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:48,467
and live a long life.

394
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,166
I'm 92 years old.

395
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:56,700
It'd be an understatement to say
that I lived a long life.

396
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,900
What's nine more months
at this point in my life?

397
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,266
If only living a little longer meant

398
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,233
that I could see that boy's face again.

399
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,367
NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA
FAMILY REUNION

400
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:30,500
Stay healthy. Until we meet again.

401
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,934
Can't you just come with us?

402
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,934
Moon-seong,

403
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:48,133
let's promise to meet here again
next year, okay?

404
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,300
Let's make a promise, like this.

405
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,567
Grandma, we'll meet again.

406
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:06,533
My name is Ri Moon-seong.
Don't forget me.

407
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,166
I never forgot him.
I kept that part of the promise.

408
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:27,767
But we couldn't keep the promise
to meet again.

409
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:35,900
That child wrapped his little pinky

410
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,133
tightly around mine.

411
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,533
I can't…

412
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:51,166
forget that feeling.

413
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Twenty years is a long time.

414
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,700
Do you think that child's grasp

415
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,734
would feel the same now?

416
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,333
Since you put it that way.
It's interesting.

417
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
I remember the first day I met you.

418
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,133
I remember so clearly.

419
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,300
If I think of you how you were back then,

420
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:25,367
I couldn't have imagined that you would
become the man you are now.

421
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,333
Wouldn't you agree?

422
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,734
The son of the man
who helped a stranger's child

423
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:41,533
at the price of himself being left behind.

424
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,100
I guess he would be
about 30 years old now.

425
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,934
A young man.

426
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:07,433
Mr. Ri Moon-seong.

427
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,633
The Chairwoman won't be returning
to this hospital after today.

428
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,900
MIRAE HOSPITAL

429
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,767
Will she really be all right?

430
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:46,200
All she did was look out the window
except when she had chemo.

431
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,200
It was as though time had stopped.

432
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:54,500
She could either spend a year like that.

433
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:58,033
Or she could move forward
for three months.

434
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,734
Her decision isn't surprising.

435
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,300
Did she just tell me her last wish?

436
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,467
-Are you going out now? It's a holiday.
-I have a meeting.

437
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,433
Here, drink this. I didn't make it.

438
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:30,066
Your aunt made it for you.

439
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,467
-Se-jun.
-Se-yeon.

440
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,667
Let's talk.

441
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:45,166
You've given up on
the liquidations, right?

442
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,667
-No.
-Se-jun.

443
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,667
AirD&D stocks are higher than Bilton's.
You know that.

444
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:57,300
-What?
-Hotels lose value the second it opens.

445
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,700
That's why I sought to liquidate
the moment it opened.

446
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:07,166
Does our family, this hotel,
the time we spent here,

447
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,734
the staff's hard word at the hotels.

448
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,600
Does it mean nothing to you?

449
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:16,700
If we can make more money by selling.
Then we should sell.

450
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:22,700
You think there's a price on everything,
but you're wrong about that.

451
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:26,133
The staff will be compensated.
Plus, they'll remain employed.

452
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,700
That's not the issue.

453
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,500
Then, what's the issue?
Why do you do business?

454
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:33,567
If I thought only about making
and spending money

455
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,967
why do you think I started off
as a restaurant waitress?

456
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,033
Don't you get it?

457
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,433
Nakwon is not a business to me.

458
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:44,100
-That's your problem.
-What?

459
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,934
You don't treat this like a business.
You love this hotel.

460
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:50,600
You stake your life on a business.

461
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,600
That's your problem.

462
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,567
Why is that a problem?

463
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,633
Fine, do what you love.

464
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,867
I'll run my business.

465
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,867
Keep what you want to keep.
Let's see how you manage.

466
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:21,633
Going somewhere?

467
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,600
I need to meet someone.

468
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,633
To meet someone?

469
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,467
What did Se-jun say?

470
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,567
How's Grandma?

471
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,467
She's fine. Don't worry.

472
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,967
How long…

473
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:44,734
How long does she have?

474
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,433
Let's not worry about that.

475
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,600
Just think about how you're going to
spend your time with her.

476
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,533
-Keep the change.
-Oh, thank you.

477
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,567
Sang-cheol, it was really hard
to put that together.

478
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,066
Traveling the seas isn't in the stars
for me.

479
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:02,734
I'm not Columbus.
I'm certainly not Ghengis Khan.

480
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:06,900
I traveled everywhere from
the Manchu fields to China's seashores.

481
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,166
I'm going to need a little more
than what we agreed on.

482
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:14,934
You have no idea what I went through.

483
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,734
The travel expense alone was astronomical.

484
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:21,767
Finish that before you say more.

485
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:38,900
NORTH KOREA AHEAD
BORDER CROSSING STRICTLY PROHIBITED

486
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:44,166
JILIN PROVINCE, CHINA

487
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:55,734
Hey, hey.

488
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,433
Sang-cheol, you heard
of the Bukhan Mountain mules?

489
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:00,734
Mules?

490
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:03,066
Drugs.

491
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:05,834
That's what Bukhan Mountain is known for.

492
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,467
These men go back and forth from China
and North Korea, carrying packs of drugs.

493
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,133
This particular one has nothing to lose.

494
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:17,033
I think he carried over 100 kgs all alone.

495
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,800
He's a notorious smuggler.

496
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,166
There's more.

497
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:24,867
Jobs that call for violence,
kidnapping, murder.

498
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,200
He'll do anything to make money.

499
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,033
Really?

500
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,066
There's information
because there is evidence.

501
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:37,834
Based on this information,
I can guarantee one thing.

502
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:43,467
This man is garbage…
the worst kind at that.

503
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,433
How long do I have?

504
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,734
You have about three months… left.

505
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,867
I could live another year
if I get hospitalized.

506
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:14,033
I could live three months
if I live here freely.

507
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,500
This man, Ri Moon-seong.

508
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,700
I can guarantee one thing.

509
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:26,166
This man is garbage…
the worst kind at that.

510
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:36,066
If only living a little longer meant
that I could see that boy's face again.

511
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:54,433
Chairwoman.

512
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:57,000
It's quite chilly today.

513
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:59,367
Shall we go inside?

514
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:05,900
I'm just waiting for my final day.

515
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:12,700
If the day is cold, it's cold.
If it's warm, it's warm.

516
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:16,600
Feeling the temperature outside as it is

517
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,433
is another one of life's pleasures.

518
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:28,166
All my life I watched my loved ones go
before me

519
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,633
My time has finally come.

520
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:36,967
Chairwoman.

521
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:42,266
When was the North and South Korea
family reunion?

522
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:44,066
That was 20 years ago.

523
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,266
My infant son
whom I left behind in the north

524
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,967
was a grown man.

525
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,834
We were all smiles as I said my goodbyes
with his son on the train platform.

526
00:49:57,834 --> 00:50:00,600
We thought we'd see each other again.

527
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,934
But…

528
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,700
at the next family reunion,

529
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,967
my son wasn't there.

530
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:13,300
Father!

531
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,266
Instead, there was a notice
about his death.

532
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:20,100
Father!

533
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:36,000
The son I bore here in the south

534
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,967
said he'd be back before he stepped out.

535
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:46,767
But he never returned.

536
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,200
I sat here,
watching my family go before me.

537
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:59,133
Just waiting for them to return home.

538
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,567
Now, I sit here…

539
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
waiting for my turn.

540
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
But your family lives on.

541
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,000
Se-yeon is here.

542
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,166
So are her brothers.

543
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,633
Remember, Chairwoman.

544
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:36,133
Yes, that's right.

545
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,900
That's right.

546
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:43,367
Yes, that's right.

547
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,133
Who made you?

548
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,266
You're beautiful.

549
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,900
Hey, Hyo-jin.

550
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,266
Se-yeon.

551
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,033
Look here. Ready?

552
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,133
One, two, three. Cheese.

553
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:36,467
Se-yeon, I've been to countless hotels
all over the world.

554
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,033
I've been to more than you.

555
00:52:38,066 --> 00:52:42,100
-You're right.
-So, speaking from my expertise,

556
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:45,166
this hotel is in the top 1% of the world.

557
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,834
Your father built it so well.

558
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,166
No, the architecture reveals
its owner's philosophy.

559
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:57,900
This hotel has Park Se-yeon written
all over it.

560
00:52:57,934 --> 00:53:01,166
Mine? It's probably
Chairwoman Ja's philosophy.

561
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,166
You and your grandmother?
Same difference.

562
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,767
It's true.

563
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,166
The architecture, the service,
the staff, the food,

564
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,367
the bedding, and even the silverware.
Only one thing matters.

565
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,734
-Nakwon.
-That's right.

566
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,800
That's why I can't sell this place.

567
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:35,967
I was able to complete my mission
because of those comrades.

568
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:38,166
Thank you.

569
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,333
Is today your last?

570
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,133
If fate allows it,
you and I will meet again.

571
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,000
You're right.

572
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:50,133
Reunification.

573
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,233
When we reunite.

574
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,200
Go Jeong-tae, Go Jeong-tae.
You're surrounded. Quietly surrender.

575
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:03,166
We will shoot If you don't surrender.

576
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,066
I repeat. Go Jeong-tae.
You are surrounded.

577
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,567
How dare you betray me!

578
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,834
No, it wasn't me.

579
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,333
I didn't report you.

580
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,033
Who else is here besides you, huh?

581
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,233
Was it you?

582
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,400
You said he was from the north.

583
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:27,567
Your democracy will fall
by the hands of the north.

584
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:28,734
Stop!

585
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,567
Let me go!

586
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:43,266
Jeong-tae.

587
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,834
You sons of bitches!

588
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:16,300
I hope there's no such thing as the DMZ
in the afterlife.

589
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:23,367
When we meet in the heavens,

590
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,600
let's have a drink together.

591
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:40,166
Jae-heon.

592
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:44,500
Jae-heon.

593
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,166
You're so awesome!

594
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,600
So awesome!

595
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,266
THEATER SUNFLOWER

596
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,533
Hey, man.

597
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Hey.

598
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,667
So, about the promo.

599
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:07,367
We have such a small audience.

600
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,834
What good is it
if the actors perform well?

601
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,900
You're the leader of this group.

602
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:15,400
Promotion is your job,
which means you have to promote the play.

603
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:20,300
Some audience members still came.
Who cares about the numbers?

604
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,867
Damn it!

605
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,433
When I…

606
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:26,500
when you said you were writing

607
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:30,500
about a North Korean soldier
who survived a shipwreck,

608
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,800
I should have known then.

609
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:35,500
People would watch Hyun Bin for that,
not us.

610
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:38,367
Trends change very quickly.

611
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:44,400
I practiced the North Korean accent,
so I can play this role for a few months.

612
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:48,533
I'm so proud of myself.
So, so proud of myself.

613
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:51,133
Fine. I'll try.

614
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,433
-Jae-heon, I loved the play.
-Hi, there you are.

615
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:58,333
-So glad you came. Thank you.
-Jae-heon.

616
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,567
Oh, an autograph, autograph.

617
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,433
-Heart.
-Thank you.

618
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:06,734
Wait, how about a picture?

619
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:09,300
-Want a picture?
-Where's your cell phone?

620
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Hey, come closer.

621
00:57:10,867 --> 00:57:12,100
-Here we go.
-Cheese.

622
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,533
One, two, three.

623
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,900
-Jae-heon.
-Yeah?

624
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,433
Someone's looking for you.

625
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:21,367
-Me?
-Yeah.

626
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,033
-Who?
-Don't know. Never seen the man.

627
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:32,066
A STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP

628
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,900
Hello.

629
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:44,900
He… hello.

630
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:47,467
I loved your performance.

631
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,967
Oh, thanks.

632
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:55,033
Your North Korean accent was excellent.
It was an impressive performance.

633
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:56,066
Thank you.

634
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:00,800
Sir, you shouldn't sit there.

635
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,900
-Yeah, it's--
-I see. I apologize.

636
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:07,500
-It's a cast members only seat.
-Is that so?

637
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,467
I haven't seen too many plays.

638
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:19,333
But to put up a life's story
on this small stage.

639
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,333
I think it's amazing.

640
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,033
Yeah.

641
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:28,734
My job isn't anything amazing.

642
00:58:29,734 --> 00:58:31,633
Actually, it is pretty amazing.

643
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:40,500
Excuse me, but which studio are you from?

644
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:47,300
Thank you.

645
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:03,333
Do you want to be in a play with me?

646
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:05,367
What?

647
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,500
On a big, great stage,

648
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:11,500
where you can change a life.

649
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
CURTAIN CALL

650
00:59:52,734 --> 00:59:57,033
A grandchild who suddenly appeared?

651
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,000
Who is this Ri Moon-Seong?

652
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,533
Let's see the selected scene first.

653
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:05,133
-You're not taking the test?
-After this piece.

654
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,867
I said it to be close to you.

655
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,667
Why am I so afraid?

656
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,667
A new young master is coming.

657
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,500
You know nothing.

658
01:00:13,533 --> 01:00:16,700
100 million won a month isn't cheap.

659
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,600
-Is this a scam?
-Should I ditch theater?
