1
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,066
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,800
EVENTUALLY,
YOU WILL SHINE UP THERE

4
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,033
WHATEVER IT IS,
DO WHATEVER YOU CAN

5
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,600
Can I ask for one as well?

6
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,166
Yes, of course.

7
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,400
What would you like me to--

8
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,967
Do you work part-time here, Jae-heon?

9
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,767
Can you write "Hyo-jin is kind"?

10
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,033
No, wait. Let's go with,

11
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,333
"No lip service for bad bitches."

12
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,767
Does that sound better?

13
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,200
What's wrong, Jae-heon?

14
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,400
What are you looking for?
Keep your eyes on me.

15
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,567
Okay.

16
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,033
So, are you part-timing here?

17
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Yes. Well, a little.

18
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:12,567
I can't believe I'm meeting you here.
It must be destiny.

19
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,333
Yeah. It's a small country.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Hey, you putting your guard up?

21
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,567
No, that's really what I think.

22
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,100
South Korea is a small country,
so we run into familiar faces…

23
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:27,500
Anyhow, now that we've met,

24
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:31,066
it'd be a shame to part ways
after a simple greeting.

25
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:35,066
-Let's go for some coffee.
-What?

26
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,734
Coffee. Let's go for coffee.

27
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,000
Man, I would really like that.

28
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,400
But I'm working right now.

29
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,767
I can't just leave. Sorry about that.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,734
That's fine. I'm real close
with this hotel's general manager.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll call her and ask. One second.

32
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,233
-The general manager?
-Yes.

33
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:07,567
-General Manager Park Se-yeon?
-Oh, you know her! That's right.

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,333
If you contact her about such things,

35
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,533
don't you think I'd be put on the spot?

36
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,834
My shift is almost over,

37
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,400
so one cup of coffee should be fine.

38
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,967
That's great. Let's go.

39
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,633
Yes.

40
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,734
Hello!

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
It's been so long.

42
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,834
I heard the promo was a major success.

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,367
Congratulations.

44
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,467
I think you could transfer
to the planning office now.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,633
I knew you were right for us.
Moon-seong, you're--

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,367
That's great, but… talk later?

47
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,633
Is she a colleague of yours?

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,000
-Yes.
-Hello.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,667
I see you're preoccupied right now.

50
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,667
Then we'll catch up later.

51
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,333
Your promo event was awesome.

52
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,100
Shall we?

53
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:27,467
This hotel hasn't been open for long,
but the numbers look great already.

54
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:32,700
Well, you've been prepaying
for this room three months in advance.

55
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,200
It's all thanks to you.

56
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:40,567
I wonder if you should disclose
these company records to me,

57
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,767
even though I am one of your VIP guests.

58
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,967
Sorry?

59
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,900
I never thought you'd actually bring it
at my request,

60
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,667
as someone in charge of administration.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's just…

62
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,400
Why do you dislike Se-yeon so much?

63
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,567
It's not that I dislike her--

64
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,700
No. You dislike her.

65
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,734
Ms. Park disliked me first.

66
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:11,734
She's Ms. Ja's granddaughter,
and I've known her since her youth.

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,533
But once she began working at the hotel,

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,967
she always seemed to pick on me
for everything I did.

69
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,033
Pick on you for what?

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,200
All of our customary business practices.

71
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,467
People must do what they must, no?

72
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,467
Oh, you mean gifts
under the table and such?

73
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,433
No, it's not necessarily that.

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,100
Basically, you provided a reason

75
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,533
for Se-yeon to dislike you,

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,200
and that's why you dislike her, correct?

77
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:41,433
I guess we could put it that way.

78
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,433
I'm going to have to ask a favor.
Please help her out.

79
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,867
You're saving up for a production?
That's why you're working part time?

80
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,400
Well, yeah.

81
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,834
May I invest in the production?

82
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,367
That's all right.

83
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,767
Isn't it important
to put the production on stage?

84
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,967
Shouldn't you be at rehearsal
instead of work?

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,100
It'd be a scam if I asked you to invest,
knowing you'd be at a loss.

86
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,567
What?

87
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,433
I mean,

88
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:21,433
I wouldn't ever wish for you
to sustain a loss with whatever you do.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,667
Wow.

90
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:26,467
Jae-heon, I loved what you said.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,767
I think you're going to make it big.

92
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,934
Remember?
I told you I think you'll make it big.

93
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:39,633
I'm not flirting or anything.
This time I really want us to be friends.

94
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,834
You know why?

95
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,367
If you make it big,
I'll be getting a superstar for a friend.

96
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,533
EVENTUALLY,
YOU WILL SHINE UP THERE

97
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,033
I…

98
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:12,000
I think I should be getting back.

99
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,233
Right. I took too much of your time.

100
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
-No, it's all right.
-Let's meet up before this is over.

101
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,233
Oh, okay.

102
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,867
-I'll pay.
-I won't object.

103
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:25,900
One second.

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,266
Whoa. Slow down.

105
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,266
Didn't want to waste that.

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,166
Where were you?

107
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,033
My stomach started hurting,
so I went to the toilet.

108
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,667
"Eventually, you will shine up there."

109
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,900
Oh, Se-yeon, you're embarrassing me.

110
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,333
It looks good.

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,500
Keep it up.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, Se-yeon.

113
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,633
Come up, ever so quietly.

114
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,100
Se-gyu, what is all this?

115
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,500
What do you mean?

116
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Isn't it cozy?

117
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Sit down.

118
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,133
What is "cozy"?

119
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,867
It means "warm and snug."

120
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,333
Let's change the setting.

121
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,934
You did this all on your own?

122
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,400
Of course. Who'd do this for me?

123
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,433
Here.

124
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:24,367
I brought quality spirits for you.

125
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,900
I stole this from Se-jun's stash. Here.

126
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,233
Cheers.

127
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,667
Ain't that good?

128
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,300
Is this really liquor?

129
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,667
It's aromatic and mellow.

130
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,633
Running down my throat,
it makes me feel wholesome.

131
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,800
Once you inherit Grandma's fortune,
you can buy these every day.

132
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,166
He's my family and my grandson,

133
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,767
whom I sought all my life.

134
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,166
What I'm saying is,

135
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:12,567
they obviously have the right
to my inheritance.

136
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,500
Moon-seong.

137
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,066
-Yes?
-Jin-suk.

138
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,667
This is great for you.

139
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,033
It's not mine to take.

140
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:31,100
I wish that were true,
but Grandma says she'll give it to you.

141
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,967
So it'll be yours.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,934
I just wanted to see Grandma,

143
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,600
then send her off peacefully

144
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,533
and go back to my life.

145
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,000
That's the only reason I came.

146
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,066
I've never had another motive.

147
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,333
I'll be watching you.

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,066
When I first heard of your existence--

149
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,734
How should I put this?

150
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,033
I was uncomfortable,
thinking about Grandma's other family.

151
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:13,367
The place you come from,
it couldn't be further from South Korea.

152
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,767
Then we find out we have to divide
our shares with you,

153
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:22,100
so I disliked you even before we met.

154
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,667
I think I can understand,

155
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,633
but it's making me sad.

156
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:30,734
But you…

157
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,233
You were different from my expectations.

158
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,200
You share when you have nothing.

159
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,433
Your comedic sense falls way below mine,

160
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,700
but my family seems to laugh more
when they're with you.

161
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:50,433
Is my comedic sense
really so far below yours?

162
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,433
You want war? You might die from laughing.

163
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,400
Warm your fingers.

164
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,934
I thought these were real.

165
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,166
They are real.

166
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,000
I think my comedic sense
is a tad above yours.

167
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,166
Se-yeon.

168
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,667
You drinking?

169
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,533
-Yes.
-What's the occasion?

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,433
Se-gyu gave it to me.

171
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,600
He stole from Se-jun's stash.

172
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,166
You were drinking good liquor without me?

173
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:58,600
You know,

174
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,367
this really tastes expensive.

175
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,900
I guess Se-gyu was feeling generous.

176
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,367
He may seem sociable and free-spirited,

177
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,333
but he doesn't easily reveal himself.

178
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,100
If he asked you for a drink, was it about…

179
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
the inheritance?

180
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,633
He probably wanted to let you know
that you shouldn't feel uncomfortable

181
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
and that he's okay with it.

182
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
He likes you.

183
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,166
It's no problem.

184
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,700
Why do you keep saying that?
It's no problem for me either.

185
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,834
I'm not interested
in Grandma's inheritance.

186
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:00,800
Not one penny.

187
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,934
It isn't mine to have.

188
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,266
I have no right to receive it.

189
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,767
That goes for all of us.

190
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,066
How are you and I any different?

191
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,233
Good night.

192
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,667
When Grandma passes,

193
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,467
Se-yeon will think she has nobody.

194
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,800
All of you will still be there.
You shouldn't think that way.

195
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey, you saw it too.
The hotel management rights, the M&A deal.

196
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,667
We're people who marry
for the hotel's sake.

197
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,033
Do you think we'd function
as a normal family?

198
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,600
So when that happens,

199
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,767
I'd like you

200
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,567
to stay by her side
and do what real families do.

201
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Can't you…

202
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,133
do that instead?

203
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,166
My balancing act
between Se-jun and Se-yeon

204
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,400
only seems to have disappointed them.

205
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,266
I didn't want to be the bad guy.

206
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,066
So…

207
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:37,667
I chose to take a step back
to be the silly one.

208
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:42,300
That's why I'm bribing
Se-yeon's prospective ally

209
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,367
with Se-jun's expensive liquor

210
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,400
to ask a favor.

211
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,934
I had a feeling you'd listen.

212
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,133
Oh, man.

213
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,367
JILIN PROVINCE, CHINA

214
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,166
Wow.

215
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:22,600
You really don't disappoint.

216
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,600
This is exactly how I imagined this.

217
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,633
Let's see.

218
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,900
-Why the hell were you looking for me?
-What?

219
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,467
Well, I'm not much different
from yourself.

220
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,500
I bark when I'm told to bark,
bite when I'm told to bite.

221
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,033
But you bite the gnarly way.

222
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,867
Where I come from,
the people have decorum.

223
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,133
Stop talking bullshit.

224
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,233
What else can I do?
Your owner is looking for you.

225
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:03,033
So, why look for me?

226
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,100
That's what I don't understand.

227
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Let me ask again.

228
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,367
Why me?

229
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,700
The thing is,

230
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:22,433
I provided what your owner asked,
but he didn't want it.

231
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,700
He's never done that before.

232
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:30,433
So, the wounded hunting dog got curious

233
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
as to what he'd been hunting for.

234
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,100
So, who are you?

235
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,066
Who the hell are you

236
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:44,033
that I must cross waters from South Korea

237
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,600
to anxiously seek you out?

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Do you know who this is?

239
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,700
This man is my owner.

240
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:01,900
What?

241
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,767
This man sent me looking for you.

242
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,934
Oh, not this man.

243
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,700
This grandma.

244
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,767
She's Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun.

245
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,400
-She's my grandmother.
-She's obviously a grandma. So what?

246
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,567
No.

247
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,033
I am this woman's grandson.

248
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,200
Grand…

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

250
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,266
What the…

251
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,433
Wait a minute.

252
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,100
How is that possible?

253
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:39,600
As long as they don't use it,
it should be fine.

254
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,567
-Well done. That's enough.
-What?

255
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,867
You don't have to bring him here.

256
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,800
So that's what happened.

257
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,734
Wow! This is massive. Wait a minute.

258
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,667
Hey, listen up.

259
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:02,600
Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun is looking
for her grandson.

260
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:05,867
Sang-cheol figured you were too much
of a piece of garbage…

261
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:09,300
I mean, you are what you are.

262
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,300
So he found an actor

263
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,467
to play her grandson.

264
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,667
That's it. Wow, that man.

265
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,433
Wow! I'm shook!

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,767
That's right.

267
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,867
Wow. It's all coming together.

268
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,333
Sit down, sit down.

269
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,667
Seeing the hairpin on your head

270
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:53,300
is bringing back memories.

271
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,567
Here.

272
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,600
1960, NAKWON INN

273
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,467
Ma'am.

274
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,066
Yes, sir.

275
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,266
Now can I stay
without having to book a room?

276
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,166
What do you mean?

277
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,133
Last time, I didn't get to say goodbye.

278
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,433
I felt bad about that.

279
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,033
I'm glad to see you again.

280
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,667
I have an early boat ride tomorrow.

281
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,233
Can you rent me a room?

282
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Yes.

283
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,133
First, can I have a bowl of gukbap?

284
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,266
I really missed this taste.

285
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,934
It's tastes the same, and so are you.

286
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,633
Had you gone overseas?

287
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,667
I stowed myself away.

288
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,100
I went from Shanghai to Japan.

289
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,333
Had I missed that boat,
leaving would've been impossible.

290
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,700
But it all worked out.

291
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,100
You're looking quite fancy.

292
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,900
You must have done well for yourself.

293
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,166
I make enough to get by.

294
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,166
My entire family died during the war.

295
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,066
All I had left in this miserable country
was myself.

296
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:05,100
I wanted to start over in a bigger world.
Japan was a bigger world indeed.

297
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,166
Then I remembered this place

298
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,767
and the last warm night I spent

299
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
in this country.

300
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,133
Forget I said you did well for yourself.

301
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,233
You must have had no place
to rest overseas,

302
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,600
if you remembered this place.

303
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,100
That's not the only reason.

304
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,400
I figured you'd still be here.

305
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Ma'am,

306
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,033
are you waiting for someone?

307
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,934
Realizing you would be here,

308
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,734
interestingly enough,
this place became a guidepost to me.

309
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,967
Stop talking nonsense.
You can go if you're done.

310
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,266
Ma'am.

311
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,333
This is for you.

312
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,233
What is this?

313
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:18,800
I bought this on the streets of Japan
because it caught my eye.

314
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,066
No, thank you.

315
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,433
A Japanese master chef once said,

316
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,467
"Taste and cleanliness are life."

317
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,967
What if your hair falls into the cauldron
while you cook?

318
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,166
Have this before you go.

319
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,767
This hairpin

320
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,867
was the first gift from that man.

321
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,734
Didn't you find yourself wondering?

322
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,033
About my grandchildren's grandfather?

323
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,000
About what kind of man he is?

324
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:36,834
Yes, well,

325
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,367
it seemed… difficult and complicated.

326
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:47,734
I have lived quite a life, haven't I?

327
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,567
You're no ordinary woman.

328
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,934
It's hard to tell these stories
to Moon-seong,

329
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,033
but as we're both women,

330
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,600
I seem to blabber everything to you.

331
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,400
It's no problem.
You can speak as you wish.

332
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:12,800
Hey, I think this will look good on you.

333
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:18,000
No, I can't possibly take this.
It's fine, really.

334
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:21,500
It's not like I'll take it to the grave.

335
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,900
Grandma.

336
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,100
Can you consider it a gift from me

337
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,767
and just take it?

338
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,967
Good.

339
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,166
How do I look? Is it pretty on me?

340
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,300
It looks very good on you.

341
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,400
How beautiful.

342
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,433
Are you okay?

343
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,767
Yes, I'm fine.

344
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,266
It looks very good on you.

345
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:12,100
I thought meeting him
would take me over the moon,

346
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,100
but I guess that's not the case.

347
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,400
I thought I had no regrets.

348
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,767
These small moments of merriment,

349
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:35,967
they are now making me want to
endure a little longer.

350
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,533
Wanting to live a bit longer.

351
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,734
Do you think this is greed?

352
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,900
What's that? It's cute.

353
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,867
Where did you get it?

354
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,667
From Grandma.

355
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,000
You said it yourself.

356
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:37,467
The more you do this,
the more wrong it feels.

357
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,333
I totally understand now.

358
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,900
Soon,

359
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,300
it'll all be over.

360
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,900
Yeah, I know.

361
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,533
But that's why it's a bigger problem.

362
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,734
We said we'd do this until she died.

363
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,266
Back then,
I told myself this was no big deal.

364
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,700
Seeing Grandma dying before us,

365
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,367
I feel…

366
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,567
so guilty.

367
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,734
Should we run?

368
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,166
We just have to walk out that door.

369
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,533
You return to being Yoo Jae-heon,
and me, Seo Yoon-hee.

370
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,000
What do you say?

371
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,967
But that's why I want to see this
to the end.

372
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,533
Because I feel so sorry.

373
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,166
I want…

374
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:43,233
Grandma to pass

375
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,266
with these memories…

376
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:50,967
we build together.

377
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:09,567
Grandma.

378
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:20,767
Grandma.

379
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,367
Moon-seong.

380
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,934
-No, no.
-Why are you here at this hour?

381
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
No, no.

382
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,467
Just lie down.

383
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,567
I just wanted to ask…

384
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,934
Can I sleep next to you?

385
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,166
What happened?

386
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,433
Have you fought with Jin-suk?

387
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,133
Jin-suk may be tiny, but she's fierce.

388
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,500
Stop joking like that.

389
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,900
I've never seen such a loving couple
as you two.

390
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,166
You're right.

391
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:24,200
I wanted to sleep by you today,

392
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,800
so I begged her forgiveness and came.

393
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Really?

394
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,066
It's been a while.

395
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,433
What do you mean?

396
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:47,100
After your children grow up

397
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:52,667
and your children's children grow up,

398
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,367
you never get to share a bed with family.

399
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:07,000
Thank you, Moon-seong.

400
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,100
It's been a long while for me too.

401
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,967
After I lost my parents,

402
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I lived with my friends.

403
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:42,800
Me and a group of friends,
we shared a tiny space

404
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,800
as our bedroom.

405
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,200
That lying next to you

406
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,934
feels like a dream.

407
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:59,133
I'm the one who's more grateful.

408
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,567
Grandma.

409
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:09,867
Sleep well.

410
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
-So… sorry…
-Grandma.

411
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,467
Grandma?

412
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,700
The guests really loved it.

413
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:57,734
Moon-seong's calligraphy was posted
all over social media.

414
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,667
The SNS feed looks great.

415
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,300
Room and restaurant reservations
have gone up

416
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,567
since the promo event.

417
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,166
Really?

418
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,834
That's great.

419
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:12,066
I was surprised that
Moon-seong could write like that.

420
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,867
Right? Isn't he talented?

421
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,333
-You seem happy.
-Do I?

422
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,200
Good work, everyone.

423
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,266
Thank you.

424
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:34,066
I like that he found his own place,

425
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:37,166
even at the hotel.

426
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:41,100
Wow.

427
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,600
This coffee is something special.

428
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,934
I was gifted quality coffee beans.
Please enjoy.

429
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,166
I'm flattered that
you want to share this with me.

430
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,166
Maybe it's the putter. It putts well.

431
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:06,500
You can use it if you like.

432
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,367
A seven-million-won
limited-edition putter.

433
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,300
Think of the person who gifted it to you.

434
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,233
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

435
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:27,033
How long have you been working for us?

436
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,333
Over 30 years.

437
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,667
If I'm parting ways with someone
who's been with us for so long,

438
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:36,667
I at least owe you quality coffee.

439
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,667
Sorry?

440
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,500
Isn't that Dong-jae's secretary?

441
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,266
He has been lodging here
for an extended period of time,

442
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:54,533
so he thanked me with this gift.

443
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
I apologize.

444
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:59,500
I wouldn't have taken it
had I known it was so expensive.

445
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,633
-I'll return it to him.
-Just that?

446
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,133
What about the rest in the box?

447
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,433
The rest…

448
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,967
What do you mean?

449
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,367
You're careless with your personal life,
so it was easy to find.

450
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,600
You secured a golf club membership
with Dong-jae's money.

451
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,934
-Se-jun.
-That's right.

452
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:36,467
You always saw me as a kid.

453
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:44,500
Sir, I haven't been thinking straight.

454
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:45,800
Wait.

455
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,834
I'll return everything I received.

456
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,133
-So please, just this once--
-Think about it.

457
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,066
When I turned my back on my sister
and spoke callously to my grandmother,

458
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,934
did you once think about
why I decided to side with you?

459
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,300
If you had an inkling of a thought…

460
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,533
you wouldn't dare exchange information
for Dong-jae's money.

461
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,867
-Sir.
-Clean up your mess and leave by tomorrow.

462
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:34,567
Mom.

463
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,767
Mom, I'm here to get some clothes…

464
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,500
Mom!

465
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:49,066
Hey, Yoon-hee. What's up?

466
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,333
I'm here for clothes.

467
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Okay. I'll be right out.

468
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:55,667
Okay.

469
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,734
I've been working on
a hotel M&A case recently.

470
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,266
It's the Nakwon Group. You know it, right?

471
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,767
The chairwoman's condition
is quite critical.

472
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,100
After the chairwoman passes away,
the eldest son will sell it,

473
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:13,100
but the youngest of the family
seems to be against the sale.

474
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,734
Good thing she's not neglecting
the smaller shareholders.

475
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:34,633
She's been working around the clock.

476
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,066
After all her hard work,

477
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:42,033
Se-jun is going to sell everything
and make his exit, huh?

478
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:45,600
I see why this is an all-out war.

479
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,367
There's a typo.

480
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,700
I can't ignore numerical typos.

481
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,200
NORTH KOREA - CHINA

482
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,633
HALF-COUSIN RI MOON-SEONG -
REAL OR FAKE?

483
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,934
INVESTIGATION ONGOING.

484
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,033
He's still doubtful, huh?

485
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,767
Did you think I'd do nothing?

486
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,934
I'll admit, it was pretty impressive.

487
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,967
You started this.

488
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:39,900
I know.

489
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,633
You going to go all the way?

490
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:51,967
I told you.

491
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,867
Do what you can.

492
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,900
I'm going to do what I have to.

493
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:01,200
Whatever happens, we'll have to live it.

494
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:03,500
Okay.

495
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,367
Think you're going to win?

496
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm not sure.

497
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,133
But, Se-jun,

498
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm confident I won't lose.

499
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,200
What now? What? What?

500
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,967
Se-jun is doubting us.

501
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,367
Well, we expected that anyway.

502
00:39:57,433 --> 00:40:01,200
He expressed his doubts
to the attorney in charge of the M&A deal.

503
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,867
Keeping questions to yourself

504
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,467
and telling someone who's not family,
they're totally different.

505
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,300
Say we'll take the inheritance.

506
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:18,100
-Geez! Not you too!
-I didn't say you should really take it.

507
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,166
-I said, let's say we are.
-What?

508
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:23,166
You're the grandson who suffered
in North Korea and China.

509
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,967
Grandma is giving you an inheritance,

510
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,266
but you refuse
and offer to leave with nothing.

511
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,867
It sounds weird, no?

512
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,867
You're basically confessing,
"I'm a fake with a conscience."

513
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,667
Just say thank you
and that you'll take it.

514
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:39,900
Then we can reveal the truth and return
everything once the chairwoman passes.

515
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,867
JILIN PROVINCE, CHINA

516
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,200
Who are you?

517
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,533
I'm here for my passport.

518
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:00,633
You know I have it.
First, pay 250,000 yuan.

519
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
-You were clear about that?
-Yes, I was clear.

520
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:15,300
Count it.

521
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,800
Who are you?

522
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,033
To you, I'm a customer.

523
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,800
-I'm here to buy him.
-You from South Joseon?

524
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:26,800
What do you mean, South Joseon?
I'm from the Republic of Korea.

525
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,633
Listen, this is simple.

526
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,567
You take the money, he gets his passport,
I take him with me.

527
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:38,200
So this is how international trade works.

528
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,066
Easy, huh?

529
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,500
-Shouldn't you count that?
-You said it was good.

530
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,767
I'm sure it's enough.

531
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,900
Ri Moon-seong, you've got connections.

532
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,834
Something's off.

533
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,400
I know men like him,
but he didn't even count the money.

534
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,133
That never happens.
His actions show he didn't need to check,

535
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,300
which means…

536
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,700
he won't let you go easily.

537
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:16,033
It's no problem.

538
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Damn it. I knew it, I knew it.

539
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Oh, boy.

540
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,700
Thought we'd give you a proper farewell.

541
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,333
I don't think you understand.

542
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,734
Before, you had something I needed.

543
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,834
But now you don't.

544
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:43,400
Know what that means?

545
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:46,367
Wow, look at this little bitch.

546
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:48,333
What the hell are you thinking?

547
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,266
-Just keep yourself safe.
-Damn it!

548
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:28,066
Ri Moon-seong, you can fight, can't you?

549
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,667
A useless hunting dog needs to hushed.

550
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:37,000
Remember, you chose this.

551
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:54,567
Wow! Moon-seong, you are something else!

552
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,433
You should've gone easy.

553
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,133
Oh, this?
He decided to breach the contract first,

554
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,467
so we deserve the penalty fee.

555
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,800
I can't remember the last time
I put powder on.

556
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,033
I'll go for some extra powder today.

557
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,166
Grandma.

558
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,200
Wow. What's this about?

559
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:59,734
What? You telling me I've overdone it?

560
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,500
I would never.

561
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,567
Grandma, you look beautiful.

562
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:07,367
I've still got it, don't I?

563
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,467
You've still got it, Grandma.

564
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:13,900
When I was your age,

565
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:17,133
I looked better than you, not worse.

566
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,767
I know.

567
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,400
But why are you all dressed up?

568
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:26,433
-I'm going with you.
-With me?

569
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,533
Aren't you going to the hotel?

570
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,967
-Yes.
-Let's go together.

571
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:27,533
-Let's go.
-Okay.

572
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:50,633
The response has been really good.

573
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:55,400
It seems that way.

574
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:59,166
Let's go.
Moon-seong will love that you came.

575
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,400
No, not now.

576
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:06,066
Let's just leave him alone.

577
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:07,300
Let him be.

578
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,300
Se-yeon,

579
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,533
do you like this hotel?

580
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,500
Of course.

581
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,667
A hotel that's like a lighthouse.

582
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:36,333
That's right.

583
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,934
That was my dream.

584
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,200
My dream.

585
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,333
Se-jun, who wanted to inherit this hotel,

586
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,967
wants to sell it more than anyone now.

587
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:55,300
You, who wanted to paint,

588
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:58,200
want to protect it more than anyone.

589
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,333
I guess

590
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,433
all this is karma

591
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,266
for your father leaving you all behind.

592
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:15,233
In a way, Se-gyu, that little brat,
hasn't changed one bit.

593
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,266
I think Se-gyu is truly

594
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,567
the one who's solid and upright.

595
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,333
Do you want to

596
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,800
protect this hotel until the end?

597
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:38,767
I thought about it.

598
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:45,200
Neither Se-jun nor Se-gyu really cares,

599
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,467
so I wondered if I felt overly responsible
as the youngest.

600
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:54,500
It was just a thought.

601
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,166
That's mature of you.

602
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm old enough to be mature, you know.

603
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:07,166
Don't you talk about your age
in front of me.

604
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,333
You know what, though?

605
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,533
I only wanted to paint

606
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:18,667
when I was sure
the hotel would be safe and sound.

607
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,734
To me,

608
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,800
Nakwon was a prerequisite.

609
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,767
Now that the hotel might disappear,

610
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:37,533
I can't think of painting
or anything else.

611
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,867
To be blunt,

612
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,467
I can paint whenever I want.

613
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,800
But once we sell the hotel,

614
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,400
we can never get it back.

615
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,100
Yes.

616
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:56,533
You're right.

617
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:15,066
You could've gone to a bar.
Why are you drinking here?

618
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,066
Oh, I was going to tell you.

619
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:24,700
I'm not going back there.

620
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:29,900
Those idiots had been
selling me champagne I'd never ordered.

621
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,166
Damn it.

622
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,700
Who do they think they are,
cheating me like that?

623
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,633
You drank it all, though?

624
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,967
-Yeah.
-Then it's fine, no?

625
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:42,000
No way. Absolutely not.

626
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,667
I'll pay for the dozens of bottles
I order,

627
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:48,600
but I won't pay for a single glass
I didn't ask for.

628
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,867
You're so consistent.

629
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:55,800
-You want the bottle?
-No, I'm good.

630
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:57,767
Where's your sense of romance?

631
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,233
Dong-jae,

632
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,367
what should I do?

633
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,834
-What do you mean?
-I mean work.

634
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,900
-What's this, all of a sudden?
-What?

635
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:18,100
The best thing about you is that
you can live without that.

636
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,500
I'm the idiot for asking.

637
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,533
Forget it.

638
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,600
The thing is,

639
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:37,734
Grandma says…

640
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:44,066
she wants us to get by without her.

641
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,700
But I don't know what life would be like
without her.

642
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,433
While she's alive,
I get to be the family's second-born.

643
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,800
So I can afford to live recklessly.

644
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,900
But after she passes,

645
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,834
I have to live as Park Se-gyu.

646
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:14,867
Wow.

647
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,633
Just, wow.
I never thought I'd see this day.

648
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,300
What?

649
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:27,567
-Park Se-gyu is growing up.
-Dude, stop talking nonsense.

650
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:31,300
Give me some ideas.
What should I do with my life?

651
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:35,867
-That's your job to find out.
-You have no empathy.

652
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:39,800
Other people's words don't matter.
You know that better than anyone.

653
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,400
My mind is chaos.

654
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:52,667
And I'm supposed to be
the strongest mentally in my family.

655
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:57,200
I can't begin to imagine
Se-yeon's feelings.

656
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Yes?

657
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:42,133
May I come in?

658
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,200
How did you know I was still here?

659
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,433
I didn't.

660
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,166
-If you weren't here, I would've left.
-And if I were?

661
00:53:54,066 --> 00:53:55,266
Let's have a drink.

662
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,400
Our relationship isn't the type to relax
and have a drink together.

663
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,166
For now, yes.

664
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,400
I won't talk about shares or marriage.

665
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:12,600
Let's just call this a cease-fire

666
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,900
or a "game loading" screen.

667
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:20,867
You have good timing, I'll say that.
I was craving a drink.

668
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,266
But you're an uncanny surprise.

669
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,333
We don't always get our way, do we?

670
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,567
I'm aware of that.

671
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,100
Do I need to hear this…

672
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,633
Forget it.

673
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:44,333
-You were always like this.
-You knew that.

674
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
I do.

675
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:50,333
Se-yeon…

676
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:56,467
if we went back to the old days,
do you think we could do better?

677
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:05,166
-No.
-Why not?

678
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:09,133
We weren't the only problem.

679
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,400
It was about Wooseong Group
and Nakwon Group.

680
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:17,900
Even if we went back to those days,
it wouldn't be any different.

681
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,400
Right. We can't change our past,
even if we tried.

682
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:27,133
But we can always change the future.

683
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,233
That's what I believe.

684
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,300
Well, I guess that's it.

685
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,700
Cease-fire over.

686
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
I'll be going.

687
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,333
Keep the drink.

688
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:26,233
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENT

689
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,934
You want to return to the laundry service?

690
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,233
Yes.

691
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,567
But why?

692
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:39,700
If you're self-conscious around others,
it's fine.

693
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:44,133
This event has changed
the staff's perspective of you.

694
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:49,834
It's a temporary stint
because of a silly talent.

695
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:53,333
Now that my reputation has gone up,

696
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:57,400
I believe this is when
I should return to the laundry service.

697
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:58,967
Wouldn't that be better?

698
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:02,066
I need to learn so much more.

699
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:05,033
There's a saying in the West:

700
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,100
"Noblesse oblesse."

701
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,467
Hey, I studied at school.

702
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,533
Se-yeon,

703
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,200
when you think I really deserve it,

704
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:24,633
you can call me up again.

705
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:27,600
I understand. I'll be waiting.

706
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:40,066
Hey, Ri Moon-seong. How do you feel?

707
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,433
Why did you buy my passport?
That was a lot of money.

708
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:50,934
We simply reclaimed it, right?
Isn't that good enough?

709
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,900
Oh, this is like an investment.

710
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,767
You know how much I paid, right?

711
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:58,533
250,000 Chinese yuan.

712
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,300
In South Korean won,
that's about 50 million won.

713
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:08,734
So when you reclaim your place,
you can pay me back 30 times that.

714
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,133
What? You'll be fine.
Don't worry and just trust me.

715
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,667
All right.

716
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:20,834
Let's go!

717
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,433
To South Korea!

718
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,834
THE WAY BACK

719
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,100
Hyo-jin.

720
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,967
Hey, Se-yeon.

721
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:47,800
Didn't you say you were going to Dubai?

722
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,533
-Yeah, later in the evening.
-What are you doing here?

723
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,834
I wanted to say goodbye
to an acquaintance.

724
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,000
-But he isn't here.
-An acquaintance?

725
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,834
Yeah, a part-timer here.

726
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:02,000
-Here?
-Yes.

727
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:04,734
-You've met him?
-Yeah. Who?

728
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,767
I wanted to introduce you to someone.
Do you remember?

729
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,633
My cousin from the North.

730
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,266
It was unfortunate
I didn't get to at Grandma's event.

731
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,734
That's right. North Korea.

732
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:19,500
I wanted to meet him before I left.

733
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:23,166
Haven't you met him?

734
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,467
-Who?
-The man who was working here.

735
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:29,734
He's my cousin.

736
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,000
He's my cousin.

737
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,667
Let's get this straight.

738
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:40,233
The man who was writing calligraphy
for your promo event?

739
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,000
-Yeah.
-Geez.

740
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:46,300
Stop talking nonsense.
He works for a rent-a-boyfriend company--

741
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:48,166
Oh, wait.

742
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:52,767
Anyway, that man is a theater actor.

743
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,567
-What?
-That man's not from North Korea.

744
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:03,066
He's a South Korean citizen.

745
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:07,000
No, he's my cousin.

746
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:10,233
-What's his name?
-Ri Moon-seong.

747
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,900
Ri Moon-seong?

748
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:14,633
No. His name is Yoo Jae-heon.

749
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,333
I think you're mistaken.

750
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,934
Wait, wait. I'll show you.

751
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,400
Is this the guy?

752
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,166
This man.

753
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,400
He's a theater actor named Yoo Jae-heon.

754
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,667
What would you like?

755
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:48,467
Yes. Iced Americano.

756
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,066
CURTAIN CALL

757
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:30,567
Se-yeon.

758
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:35,467
Grandma, if Moon-seong were…

759
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:36,533
Yes?

760
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,333
Just stay here for a while.

761
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:43,266
I was reminded of the past
while I was waiting for you.

762
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,967
Pick up the phone, you punk.

763
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,166
Jae-heon, I'm scared.

764
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,133
I've never seen anyone from my hometown.

765
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,900
Let them know that Ri Moon-seong is here.
