00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,567
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

3
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,500
Hey, you know what?

4
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:40,967
I'm feeling anxious.

5
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:43,533
About what?

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,166
A lot of people are coming today,

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,433
and I'll be publicly introduced
as Grandma's grandson from the North.

8
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,300
My God.

9
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,600
I mean,

10
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,066
the situation is blowing up.

11
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:04,266
Still, if we just get through this,
maybe we won't have to run into people.

12
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,433
You're right.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,533
Plus, it's Grandma's last event.

14
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:15,300
Let's stay alert and try not to slip up.

15
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,767
-Okay.
-Okay?

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Let's go.

17
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:21,867
Link arms.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,033
EPISODE 7

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Se-yeon!

20
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,000
You both look really great.

21
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,934
Thank you. It must be these fancy clothes.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,734
-You look beautiful, Se-yeon.
-You look pretty.

23
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,567
Thank you.

24
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Se-yeon, where is Grandma?

25
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,567
She's in the waiting room
but will be out once the banquet starts.

26
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:22,734
I understand.

27
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,300
Wow. There are so many people here.

28
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,533
-Right?
-Thank you for coming.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,266
-Thank you for having me.
-Welcome.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
Good day.

31
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,200
She must be very nervous.

32
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,233
Jin-suk, are you okay? What's up?

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
What's wrong?

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,567
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

35
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,934
-What's wrong?
-Hey, Se-yeon!

36
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,734
Hyo-jin!

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
You look so beautiful.

38
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,233
-Hey, what's up?
-Someone I know is here.

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,133
-What?
-Remember the cousin I told you about?

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Right. Your cousin from North Korea?

41
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,000
-I will introduce him to you.
-Okay, great.

42
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,066
Moon-seong!

43
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,467
Moon-seong.

44
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,467
-What do we do?
-Quiet. Let me think.

45
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,000
Is that him?

46
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,834
Yeah. He's acting strange.

47
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,433
Come here.

48
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:55,967
Moon-seong.

49
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,233
Someone I know is here.

50
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,033
Who is it?

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,967
Moon-seong.

52
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,066
What's wrong?

53
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,734
Hang on to me.

54
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,633
-What's with him?
-Hey.

55
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,533
Moon-seong!

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Moon-seong, are you okay? Moon-seong.

57
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,367
Tell them to back away.

58
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,900
-Oh, okay.
-Moon-seong!

59
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,867
Hello? Someone help!

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,967
Someone help him!

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,767
Lift him and put him on my back.

62
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,467
Come on.

63
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,367
To the medic.

64
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,600
To the medic! Open the door!

65
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,133
This way.

66
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:09,100
-What's wrong?
-Oh, no. It's no big deal.

67
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,633
He's just really nervous. He'll be fine.

68
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,967
Hey, she's gone. She's gone.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,433
Stop it. She's gone.

70
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,934
She left. That's enough.

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Damn it.

72
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,633
What happened out there?

73
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,767
Someone I know is here.

74
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,600
Someone you know?

75
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,600
A former client.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,433
I think she knows Se-yeon.

77
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,800
Who is she exactly? Give me details, kid.

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,133
Wait, Mr. Jeong.

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
I feel nauseous.

80
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:55,967
Stay unconscious.

81
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,633
Take off your shoes and everything.
Keep up the act.

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,867
I'll be right back.

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,266
-What now?
-Where are you going?

84
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,767
We just caused a ruckus.
I need to handle the aftermath.

85
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,700
Let go of this. Let go.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,266
Close your eyes.

87
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,433
I'll be back.

88
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
I thought we were through, for real.

89
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,734
My hands are still shaking.

90
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,700
Hey.

91
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,934
Be honest.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,967
Honestly, I was pretty good, huh?
You agree?

93
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,700
Oh, yeah.

94
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,567
You did some pretty quick thinking.

95
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,133
The acting I just did,
it doesn't come from thinking.

96
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:59,300
It's an actor's instinct
that gushes out from the spine.

97
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Whatever.

98
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,066
Hey, forget about me.

99
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:09,000
-What was up with you?
-What?

100
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,867
I obviously had a familiar face there.

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,066
But why were you anxious?

102
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,133
Someone's coming. Lie down.

103
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,433
Someone could, I mean.

104
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,667
Hey, my shoes.

105
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,767
-Why can't you take them off?
-My tie, my tie.

106
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,133
You for real?

107
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,266
-You're not actually sick, you know.
-I'm unconscious, remember?

108
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,333
Mr. Jeong, are we ready to go?

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,066
How are the guests? Can I go out now?

110
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,000
Chairwoman, there's been…

111
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,734
What's happened?

112
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,166
How can someone unconscious
have a high heart rate?

113
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,834
Wow. He must be really nervous.

114
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
What…

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,166
do you mean by that?

116
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:33,367
If he's nervous, he can't be unconscious.

117
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,633
In other words, he's…

118
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,467
pretending.

119
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,467
Would you mind explaining
what this is about?

120
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,500
Hey, buddy. Hey.

121
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,633
Isn't it harder
to pretend to be unconscious?

122
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,467
It has to be.

123
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,000
Doctor, I have something to tell you.

124
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,400
Oh, my. How is Moon-seong? How is he?

125
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,633
No need to worry.

126
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,266
It looks like a simple panic attack.

127
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,700
He'll recover with a little rest.

128
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:28,500
-Does he have some kind of illness?
-Well, that's…

129
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not sure, ma'am.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,233
You said he's from North Korea, right?

131
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,867
-Yes, yes.
-First, he's in an unfamiliar place.

132
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,367
His environment and identity
have completely shifted.

133
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:46,667
Besides, he's at this
well-attended formal event.

134
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:50,333
Even normal people will find
such situations stressful.

135
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,066
So is he really okay?

136
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,133
Well, anxiety disorders are
as common as insomnia.

137
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:00,667
In my professional opinion,
he just needs a few hours of rest.

138
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,533
I guess he's okay.

139
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,467
-Yeah.
-Let's go home together after this, okay?

140
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:12,133
But I must at least go see his face
if he's passed out.

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,734
You should listen to her.

142
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,867
You grandson will best benefit
from some rest.

143
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,567
I was too blinded by my excitement

144
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:25,467
that I didn't consider how the kids felt
and just pushed them too hard.

145
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:29,900
Let's go, Grandma.
Letting him rest is what's best for him.

146
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,967
-Right?
-Exactly right.

147
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,900
Chairwoman, you have to go now.

148
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,567
Everyone is waiting for you.

149
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,667
Moon-seong will be all right?

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Don't worry. Let's go.

151
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,233
No worries, indeed.

152
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,467
What recovery? He isn't even sick.

153
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
What are you doing, exactly?

155
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
It's all for the chairwoman.

156
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,867
I just staked my profession on a lie.

157
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:17,433
As for me,

158
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,467
I staked my entire life.

159
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,100
Everyone will find out eventually.

160
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,767
But for now,
could you keep this to yourself?

161
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,600
As a doctor, this is like…

162
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,300
thinking about the afterlife.

163
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,433
Sorry?

164
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,133
Just because you want to know
if there is an afterlife

165
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,934
doesn't mean you should die early.

166
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,433
Thank you.

167
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Right, then.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,633
What's wrong? You really sick?

169
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,533
I'm lying down because I'm sick.

170
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,200
Now that I think about it,

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
I think I really might be sick.

172
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,266
Yoo Jae-heon, get it together.

173
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,433
Am I Ri Moon-seong or Yoo Jae-heon?
It's getting confusing.

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,200
You're some Method actor, huh?

175
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:20,567
I thought about the difference
between Yoo Jae-heon and Ri Moon-seong.

176
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,800
About life and theater…

177
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,033
Aren't they one and the same?

178
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,433
Isn't life some sort of play?

179
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,333
Just a thought.

180
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,900
Who says we're special?

181
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,767
People all live the same.

182
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,266
Hyo-jin.

183
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,767
Se-yeon. Is he okay?

184
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
He's fine.

185
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,667
I was looking forward to meeting
a North Korean.

186
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,700
I'll introduce you to him next time.

187
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,233
Hi, Hyo-jin.

188
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,600
You were invited too?

189
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,000
Of course. I work here.

190
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,600
-One extra ticket, thanks to her.
-Oh, I see.

191
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,533
Let's go sit.

192
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,400
Dong-jae.

193
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,000
Hyo-jin, it's been a while.

194
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,400
-I'm not late, am I?
-No. We're about to start.

195
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,834
What is this random entrance?

196
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,033
Are you back together?

197
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,433
It's good to see everyone.

198
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,033
Since we're all here,
let's make this official.

199
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,367
What is he saying?

200
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,967
-We're getting married.
-What? For real?

201
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:57,000
Now that you know,
spread the word to all our acquaintances.

202
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,400
-Is this true?
-No.

203
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:03,100
Right. You scared me. She says no.
Why are you scaring people?

204
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm for real.

205
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,467
The chairwoman has arrived.

206
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,500
I'd like to express how grateful I am

207
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,000
that you all managed to attend

208
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,367
despite your busy schedules.

209
00:14:54,133 --> 00:15:00,066
I gather everyone in attendance
is here by invitation.

210
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,900
I asked that those invitations be extended
with special care.

211
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,133
I believe the recipients will have felt
the pressure to attend.

212
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,533
You can't ignore an invitation like that,
can you?

213
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,166
I'm in my 90s now,

214
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:30,734
so you probably wondered
what kind of event this might be about.

215
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,400
As you read on the invitation,

216
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:41,233
this is a farewell party.

217
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,800
Yes, that's right.

218
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:51,300
It's a farewell party
for you to give me a send-off.

219
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,033
My doctor says

220
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,567
I have three months to live, at best.

221
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,467
No need to be surprised.

222
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,433
I'm over 90 years old.

223
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,300
My limbs are fine. My mind is clear.

224
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,800
What a way to pass.

225
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:37,300
I've stared death in the face
for a long time now.

226
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,734
Very few of my friends remain alive.

227
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,834
I've fulfilled my last wish too.

228
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,900
I have nothing else to desire from life.

229
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:57,433
Leading up to my death,
I believe it is a heavenly blessing

230
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,300
that I got to have fellowship
with you tonight.

231
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,834
So instead of a funeral,

232
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,200
I prepared this farewell party.

233
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:21,333
Even if you attend my funeral,
it will mean nothing to me.

234
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Don't you agree?

235
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,967
So instead of having a funeral
or a mourning period,

236
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:35,433
I'm going to spend my last days quietly
with my family.

237
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,633
I want my grandchildren
to take note of this.

238
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
And so,

239
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,367
today will be the last time

240
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,600
you and I

241
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,333
will meet.

242
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,934
Please

243
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,667
send me off with a smile.

244
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:29,867
Chairwoman.

245
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,500
You're Se-jun's guests?

246
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,166
Thank you for coming.

247
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:41,333
This is Attorney Oh.
She's leading our M&A operations.

248
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,767
Hello, Chairwoman.
I've heard so much about you.

249
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:47,233
You probably didn't hear
good things about me, then.

250
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,166
No, I've only heard good things.
You're even more wonderful in person.

251
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,333
You're quite amazing, Chairwoman.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,467
Well, thank you.

253
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:02,800
These gentlemen are from Bilton,
on the receiving end of the M&A of--

254
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,500
Hello.

255
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:14,700
I told you to invite
your ten closest acquaintances,

256
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,033
and you bring only business partners?

257
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,867
What about your friends?
Don't you have any other acquaintances?

258
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,533
These are the people
who I'm closest to now.

259
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,900
Seung-do, why are you just standing there?

260
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,200
Sorry?

261
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,533
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,333
Se-gyu.

263
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh, you're all Se-gyu's friends.

264
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,800
Hello, Grandma.

265
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,300
Grandma, you remember Wook-hyeong?

266
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:53,233
Of course I do. He's your best friend.

267
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,800
In elementary school, you were asked
to write your best friend's name,

268
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:03,066
and he wrote yours,
and you wrote his, right?

269
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:06,233
Grandma, you are amazing. Applause!

270
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,233
All right. You all be well.

271
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,867
Yes, ma'am. Sit down, sit down.

272
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,033
Chairwoman.

273
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, my. Good to see you.

274
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,834
Look who it is.

275
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,667
Is your father well?

276
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:25,734
Yes. He wanted to come,
but he has a business trip overseas.

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,266
That's all right.

278
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,333
Please tell him I said hello.

279
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I'll be waiting up there.

280
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:37,066
But tell him to take his time
and do everything he has to do.

281
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,567
Sorry?

282
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm joking, girl.

283
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,734
Oh, you startled me.

284
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,734
Chairwoman.

285
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,700
Oh, Dong-jae. How have you been?

286
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,734
I'm glad to see you looking healthy.

287
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,500
I may look healthy.

288
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,400
But you heard me. I have three months.

289
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,867
But you must see Se-yeon get married.

290
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,934
We'll get to preparing.

291
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,233
Is that what's happening?

292
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
No, Grandma.

293
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,133
-She says no.
-She will.

294
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,433
-He says you will.
-I said no.

295
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:21,767
Se-yeon, if it makes you happy,
I'm fine with it.

296
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,200
Do what you want.

297
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,934
No, Grandma.

298
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,767
So you won't object if she's fine with it?

299
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,867
Of course not.

300
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:33,633
Then why did you object before?

301
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,400
Because she told me
she didn't want you back then.

302
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:47,200
Chairwoman, the other guests are waiting.
Shall we?

303
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,433
Of course. See you in a bit.

304
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,967
Mr. Jeong, it's been a while.

305
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,467
Yes, it has.

306
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,600
Enjoy your time here.

307
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,467
Is Moon-seong okay?

308
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes. Don't worry too much.

309
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,667
Mom!

310
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:36,266
Mom!

311
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,700
Jae-heon.

312
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:40,967
Jae-heon.

313
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,300
Moon-seong.

314
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,433
Moon-seong.

315
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,600
Are you all right?

316
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,567
Grandma.

317
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,300
Oh, thank heavens.

318
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,033
Thank heavens you're okay.

319
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,533
Oh, goodness.

320
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,300
Thank heavens you're okay.

321
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,934
Oh, what a relief.
I'm holding your soft hands.

322
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,400
Grandma, I'm fine.

323
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,066
Thank heavens. I thank the heavens.

324
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,233
Thank you, Moon-seong.

325
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,834
Thank you.

326
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,967
Thank you.

327
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
Moon-seong.

328
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,834
Today was your greatest hurdle.

329
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,400
Good job. You both did great.

330
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:41,967
There won't be anything like this again,
so don't worry too much.

331
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,066
Let's keep it going.

332
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,667
Actually,

333
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,734
I'd like to stop here.

334
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,233
You say that now? Why?

335
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,467
The thing is,

336
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,767
the more I become Ri Moon-seong,

337
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,600
the more I feel like
I'm doing something wrong.

338
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,100
I feel the same.

339
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,633
This feels wrong.

340
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,200
Do you feel like
you're doing something wrong?

341
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,100
You've done nothing wrong.

342
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,734
We're on a contractual agreement,
and you did as I asked.

343
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,767
If what we're doing is wrong,

344
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,900
then it's all on me.

345
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,767
Do you really think this play of ours…

346
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,367
is making Grandma a little happier?

347
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:57,867
The chairwoman I know
is as tough as they come.

348
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,834
I've never seen her swayed by emotions.

349
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,967
But these days, the chairwoman

350
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,133
is laughing and crying.

351
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
Isn't that good enough?

352
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,367
I guess… that is good enough.

353
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,066
I don't know for how much longer
I can keep up the act,

354
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,066
but as long as I play her grandson…

355
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,400
I hope…

356
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,800
Grandma…

357
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,100
can laugh a little more.

358
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:03,633
Yes.

359
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,233
Of course she should.

360
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,367
Come on out.

361
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:30,533
Are we okay?

362
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,533
Stop being a wimp and come out, you punk.

363
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:49,433
Thank you.
I would be dead if it weren't for you.

364
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,233
Don't worry about that.
This is just part of the transaction.

365
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Since I've done you a favor,
you can do me one, yes?

366
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:58,667
Of course.

367
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,266
Ri Moon-seong-- Where is he now?

368
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,967
GENERAL MANAGER PARK SE-YEON

369
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,066
Se-yeon.

370
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,166
Oh! When did you install this?

371
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,533
I'm quick to pick up on convenience.

372
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,734
I'm trying to adjust
to the South Korean ways.

373
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,533
Yeah. That's the attitude.

374
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,533
How do you feel?

375
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,633
Se-yeon, I have a favor to ask.

376
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,367
Why are we here?

377
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,567
I wanted to come here with you.

378
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:07,266
I wasn't ever going to revisit this place.

379
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,300
Grandma!

380
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,533
Grandma!

381
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,967
Grandma, I'm floating on water!

382
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,900
Grandma!

383
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:40,934
Hey.

384
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,900
Do you see that?

385
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
What?

386
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,734
That over there. That.

387
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,767
-Oh, the boat?
-Yeah. Do you see it?

388
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,667
Yeah. I see it clearly.

389
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,300
Grandma!

390
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,967
Grandma!

391
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,667
It's Moon-seong!

392
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,300
Grandma, I'm here!

393
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,734
Oh, it's Moon-seong--

394
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,367
Is it really him?

395
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Surprise!

396
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,500
You knew?

397
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:23,467
He begged me to bring you here.

398
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,233
Oh, my goodness.

399
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,300
Hey, hey. Be careful!

400
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,333
Grandma!

401
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,100
Grandma, I'm here!

402
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:37,133
Grandma, I'm here!
It's your grandson, Moon-seong!

403
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,400
YOUNG RANG

404
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,500
Grandma!

405
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,133
Hey, be careful.

406
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
My goodness.

407
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,834
Oh, my.

408
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:04,400
At this rate,
I'll die from you shocking me.

409
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,734
Grandma, were you surprised?

410
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:11,400
Grandma, I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

411
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,033
Grandma, we just met.
How can we part ways?

412
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,200
I'll never let you go.

413
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,934
All right, all right. That's enough.

414
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,700
You sweet thing.

415
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,867
He's all sunshine and rainbows.
I wonder who he takes after.

416
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,367
Is this Attorney Kang?

417
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It's me.

418
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,200
I need you to come see me.

419
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:29,967
Mr. Kang.

420
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:37,000
-What brings you here?
-I spoke to the chairwoman.

421
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,233
What for?

422
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,567
Well, it's…

423
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,600
Oh, good. Se-jun, have a seat.

424
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,767
Tell everyone to gather.

425
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,467
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,133
I know it's been quite hectic recently
for a lot of reasons.

427
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:03,500
I should have done this earlier.
This is long overdue.

428
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,567
What is it now?

429
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,600
-Attorney Kang.
-Yes, Chairwoman.

430
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,900
It seems all the inheritors are here.

431
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:17,934
The chairwoman has revised her will today.

432
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,533
Grandma, what's this about?

433
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,233
I cannot reveal the details,
but I can inform you

434
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:31,000
that a new inheritor
has been added to the will.

435
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,533
That's right.

436
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,700
Grandma, does that mean--

437
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:41,367
He's my family and my grandson,
whom I've sought all my life.

438
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,333
What I'm saying is,

439
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,500
they obviously have a right
to my inheritance.

440
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,100
Moon-seong.

441
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,367
-Yes?
-Jin-suk.

442
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,934
This is great for you.

443
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,667
Is that so?

444
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:50,567
So, why-- How is this going to work?

445
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:55,033
Yoon-hee, Grandma changed her will.

446
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,500
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't come here, right?

447
00:35:58,567 --> 00:35:59,900
Right.

448
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,500
Wow. We just changed the course
of this family's future.

449
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,400
Right? This is like Interstellar.

450
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,333
Mr. Jeong, to be honest,
I want to go warn my past self.

451
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,300
You know what I'd say?
"Make him stay! Don't let me leave!"

452
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,600
Stop that.

453
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Let's think.

454
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,300
Our contract ends when Grandma passes.

455
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,133
The will takes effect after she dies.

456
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,367
Yeah.

457
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:39,233
Since we aren't actually related,
the inheritance won't be our problem.

458
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,233
I don't know much about that stuff,

459
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,233
but rewriting the will,
isn't that a problem in itself?

460
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,500
-That's true.
-What the hell?

461
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,967
But we're like freelancers
bound to a contract.

462
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,900
Free-- Yeah.

463
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:00,200
Which means
it's the employer's responsibility

464
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:02,266
to tackle all work-related incidents.

465
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,300
Legally, we won't be held responsible
for any of it.

466
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:17,033
Director Park Se-jun offered ten times
the current stock price

467
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,333
with the condition
of acquiring Ilseong Partners.

468
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,467
Ignore him.

469
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,133
-But it's ten times.
-Don't make me repeat myself.

470
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,500
Yes, sir.

471
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,433
Did Se-yeon make any offers?

472
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,433
Not yet.

473
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,667
You may go.

474
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:48,700
Buying stocks from Dong-jae
is proving to be a challenge.

475
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,066
Offer him 20 times the price.

476
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:56,867
He says there's no chance of negotiation
even if you offer 100 times the price.

477
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:02,767
Do we need to overexert ourselves
to buy Dong-jae's shares?

478
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:07,700
-What do you mean?
-As far as Se-yeon is concerned,

479
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:11,367
she loves this hotel more than anything.

480
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,000
-So what?
-The reason she broke off her engagement

481
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,100
was because his family,
the owners of Woosang Group,

482
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:22,300
said something about
a gukbap restaurant owner lucking out

483
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:25,633
and becoming a lowly innkeeper
shooting for the Woosang Group.

484
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,000
It's all gibberish, really.

485
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,166
So what?

486
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:35,133
Do you really think Se-yeon would
reconsider marrying him?

487
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,767
It's true that Se-yeon loves the hotel,
which is why it's a problem for us.

488
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,800
What do you mean by that?

489
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:48,767
She will do anything to save the hotel.

490
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:55,066
If marrying Dong-jae is her last resort
to save the hotel…

491
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,500
she would marry him without hesitation.

492
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,734
But would she really go that far?

493
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:09,200
It's best to eliminate
any potential threats.

494
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,367
We must buy all the shares we can.

495
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,066
Yes. I understand.

496
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,266
It's time for me to shake things up.

497
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:29,367
If we add your shares
with Ilseong Partners' shares

498
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:33,300
and top it off with the shares from
our new share-riding Prince Charming--

499
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:34,400
This can work.

500
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:39,834
Since the shares will be redivided,
Se-gyu and Se-jun will get fewer shares.

501
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,767
We can win this one, right?

502
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,567
You're totally safe.

503
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,934
-Miss Hong.
-Yes, Miss Park?

504
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:57,600
Our hotel and position will remain safe
for the foreseeable future,

505
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:01,367
so let us do our due diligence
and align our command and discipline.

506
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,667
Mr. Bae, Director Park Se-jun is here.

507
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:07,734
Okay.

508
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:10,934
Why the visit?

509
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Let's talk.

510
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,200
Whiskey?

511
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:26,367
No, I'm good.

512
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,033
You're boring.

513
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,900
Is this about the Nakwon shares?

514
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,367
The 4% I own in Ilseong Partners--

515
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,900
Let me save you the trouble.

516
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,934
Go someplace else.

517
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,633
No, I'm here because of Se-yeon.

518
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,867
Do you have to go to such extremes
to marry Se-yeon?

519
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:47,867
How dishonest.
You are here because of the shares.

520
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:52,266
Gluing together pieces of a broken glass
won't mend everything.

521
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:56,033
Why do you obsess over her
when you want for nothing?

522
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,066
This is why we can't converse.

523
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,000
That glass you speak of--

524
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:04,133
What if that's the only one I have?

525
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,333
I should do what I can
to make it whole, no?

526
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,633
I guess you would just throw it away,
since yours is already broken.

527
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,000
Let me ask you this.

528
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:19,900
Why are you so obsessed
with selling the Nakwon Group?

529
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:22,133
-Now is the optimum time--
-Se-jun.

530
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:25,767
500 billion or a trillion won--
Is there a significant difference?

531
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,300
No, right?

532
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:30,333
You can't use it all up anyway.

533
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Going to take the cash to your grave?

534
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:38,667
Is Nakwon Group your broken glass?

535
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,934
Good shot!

536
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,133
Good shot!

537
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,500
You hit pretty far!

538
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:20,000
Thank you.

539
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,967
You came because of the M&A deal, no?

540
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,033
You're interested in my shares.

541
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,700
You're sharp.

542
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:30,266
You sure are a rising young entrepreneur.

543
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,166
Unafraid to speak your mind.

544
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,133
I want the deal to go through.

545
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,834
I'm not into long-term investment.
I want fast cash.

546
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,700
Plus, the conditions look good.

547
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Good shot!

548
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,033
You're quite decisive as well.

549
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,300
I don't like it when things drag out.

550
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:53,767
Nice one!

551
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,767
-Do you like golf?
-It's fun.

552
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,400
Why do you think that is?

553
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,934
What do you mean by that?

554
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,900
We walk hundreds of yards each time
just to hit the ball.

555
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,967
Then when we make a successful putt,
we feel satisfaction.

556
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,867
Isn't that what's fun about it?

557
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:19,233
If we could make it in one shot,
why would people become so invested?

558
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,533
Don't you think?

559
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:22,934
You're right.

560
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:30,233
You could join me in taking each step
until Nakwon becomes the greatest.

561
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,600
I think that would be fun to watch.

562
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:39,934
Would it?

563
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,433
I'll consider it.

564
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Whether I'll need that sort of fun
or whether it really will be fun.

565
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:07,500
As far as fun goes,
hotel management ranks fourth on the list.

566
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:09,367
Fourth?

567
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:14,266
Raising dogs, raising cats,
playing golf, and then…

568
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:22,000
If you said it came in first,
I wouldn't have thought twice about this.

569
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:25,767
I think I can trust you.

570
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:30,367
Our reviews are improving quite a lot,
because our general manager

571
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:33,433
is quite sensible
when it comes to managing the hotel.

572
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,200
We look forward
to your affirmative answer.

573
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
She looks happy enough.

574
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,967
She liked what she heard.

575
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,000
What?

576
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,367
Then what?

577
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:57,500
He wants Moon-seong's medical records.

578
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,967
Se-jun said that?

579
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:02,633
Yes. I told him I didn't do any paperwork

580
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,033
because I conducted
a simple diagnosis at the hotel.

581
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,433
I also said medical records are private.

582
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Even to family.

583
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:14,600
Thank you.

584
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,066
You still won't tell me
what this is about?

585
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:22,533
Shouldn't I be aware to a certain extent
as to what I'm getting into?

586
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,834
Let's sweep this under the rug for now.

587
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,066
It's better that you don't know,
so that when it hits the fan,

588
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,266
you can say you didn't know.

589
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:41,767
Se-yeon is meeting the shareholders
in favor of the deal to persuade them.

590
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,166
-Was she successful?
-She finds their vulnerabilities easily.

591
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:53,400
-So she has information?
-Information?

592
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:01,800
Se-yeon's right-hand woman.

593
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:03,967
Yes, Ra-kyung.

594
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:09,233
She's a manager at the planning office.
Her work relationship with Se-yeon

595
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,834
is like mine with you.

596
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,200
Get rid of her.

597
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,033
Sorry?

598
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,567
Who has the authority
to get her transferred?

599
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,333
That would be me.

600
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
From now on, it's an all-out war.

601
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:44,033
Let's see if Se-yeon can puppeteer
without her arms and legs.

602
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:50,567
You really are something.
Your experience speaks for itself.

603
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:54,800
Ra-kyung, what about this person?

604
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:00,367
Ra-kyung?

605
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,800
-Yes, Miss Park?
-Is something wrong?

606
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,033
I was going to tell you
when things were final.

607
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,000
As of today,
I'm moving to Nakwon's Jeju location.

608
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,667
What?

609
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,834
Was it Mr. Kim?

610
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,867
So he's going to play dirty.

611
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:36,667
He can't do this. It makes no sense.

612
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:40,533
-I'll speak to the chairwoman--
-Se-yeon.

613
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,700
I wasn't fired. I'll be transferred.

614
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:45,533
-Ra-kyung.
-That's the kind of fight this is.

615
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,567
Se-yeon.

616
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:54,200
Don't ever give in, okay?

617
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,667
Please tell Mr. Bae I said thank you.

618
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,233
Well, this is a surprise.

619
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,934
How can you just barge in like that?
Have you no manners?

620
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,934
How dare you mention manners to me.

621
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,567
You may go.

622
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,800
What I did was within my power.

623
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,200
I took the required steps
to transfer an employee.

624
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:36,367
You took my person
without even mentioning it to me.

625
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:40,266
I fully understand your intention.

626
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,233
I'm glad you understand.

627
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:45,767
You're glad?

628
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:51,567
Mr. Kim.

629
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,767
Yes?

630
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:55,867
Don't get too comfortable.
I suggest you stay on your toes.

631
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:58,834
Watch and see what I'm able to do.

632
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,333
Mother.

633
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:35,700
Mother!

634
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:36,767
Mother.

635
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:39,500
Mother.

636
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,367
Mother.

637
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:43,166
Father!

638
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,233
Father!

639
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,767
Stop this!

640
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:49,433
Moon-seong, I'm glad you're here.
Let's go see Grandma.

641
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,900
We can take a boat to see Grandma.

642
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:53,200
Stop it!

643
00:49:55,467 --> 00:50:00,834
I have to leave you in Grandma's hands,
so I can rest easy, you understand?

644
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:04,934
Poor thing.

645
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,667
Moon-seong, I've done nothing for you.

646
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:12,767
Your grandfather and your mother
died so early. How will you live?

647
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,700
How will you live, Moon-seong?

648
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:21,333
Mother.

649
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,000
After we left you, my heart…

650
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,133
My heart was so broken, Mother.

651
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:35,600
I really wanted to embrace you, Mother.

652
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:39,300
To be in your arms.

653
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:47,667
To cry with you.

654
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:53,200
To tell you I'd been living
with a heartache.

655
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,834
Father, don't wait for her here.

656
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
Grandma's not here.

657
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:03,734
Father.

658
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Father.

659
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,033
Father!

660
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,633
Father!

661
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:15,734
Father!

662
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:20,200
Father!

663
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:24,100
Father!

664
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Father!

665
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,367
Father!

666
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:35,467
Father!

667
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,900
Father!

668
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,600
JILIN PROVINCE, CHINA

669
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:08,166
Look, I smuggled him into South Korea.

670
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,500
What? Did he tell you to bring him back?

671
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,934
Your boss is quite vicious.

672
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:17,767
He wanted to get meat for the kids.

673
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,967
So he took a few coins.
Does he want to capture him that bad?

674
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,100
Whose boss are we talking about?

675
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:26,233
The kid wouldn't have survived
here anyway.

676
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,300
I had to help him leave.

677
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:31,700
How did he leave?

678
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:34,500
Someone picked him up from the South.

679
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:37,166
Who?

680
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:41,066
I don't know.
I just needed to deliver him and get paid.

681
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:52,600
Hey, Moon-seong.

682
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,467
If you want to go, tell me. I'll help you.

683
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,066
I need identification…

684
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,433
with my name, Ri Moon-seong, on it.

685
00:53:15,133 --> 00:53:16,333
I need something

686
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:19,166
that can prove

687
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,300
that I'm me.

688
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,734
Call.

689
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,734
Wow.

690
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,834
That's a good card. You're a pro.

691
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,500
I'm a natural.

692
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,233
Nine.

693
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,700
Were you shot in the head?

694
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,900
I'm choosing to hand it to you. Let's go.

695
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:05,567
All right. Let's go.

696
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:11,467
Let it all out. All right, all right.

697
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,000
What just happened?

698
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,800
You can't even take what's handed to you.

699
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:22,200
You son of a bitch. I'll kill you.

700
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:24,300
Think carefully.

701
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,266
What guarantees are there in gambling?
It's all luck.

702
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,133
I just don't understand gamblers.

703
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,400
Don't you agree,

704
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,767
Comrade Ri Moon-seong?

705
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:44,533
-Honestly, I can't figure it out.
-What?

706
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
That's why I came all the way here.

707
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,033
Tell me,

708
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,867
Ri Moon-seong.

709
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,600
Who the hell are you?

710
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,867
LIFE BEGINS AT 90
GRANDMA NOW STARTING TO WALK

711
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,333
It's you, Se-yeon.

712
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,133
Grandma.

713
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,200
What? You can't sleep?

714
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,000
Se-yeon.

715
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:21,633
Did I upset you too?

716
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,967
No. Don't say that.

717
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,300
I want Moon-seong

718
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:31,767
to stay with us for life.

719
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:34,767
He's also your grandson.

720
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,900
Yes. Thank you.

721
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:44,000
It seems only you understand
how I really feel.

722
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,467
What is it? Something happen?

723
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,166
Is it the hotel?

724
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:55,433
No, it's…

725
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:59,100
Ra-kyung has been transferred
to Jeju Island.

726
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,934
She was a great source of strength to me.

727
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:07,700
But seeing her unfairly transferred…

728
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,233
just really upsets me.

729
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,100
Mr. Kim took the swing,
but Se-jun's behind this.

730
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,600
So, he really wants to sell the hotel?

731
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,600
I thought it was because
he had a lot on his mind

732
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,700
and because he was upset with you.

733
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,133
But now, something's off.

734
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:38,367
It's as if he's being chased.
Se-jun wouldn't be so brutal like this.

735
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,867
I'm going to stop him.

736
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,200
Se-yeon.

737
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,166
Ra-kyung may have been
like a sister to you,

738
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,333
but Se-jun is really your brother.

739
00:56:57,133 --> 00:57:00,900
I'm glad you want to protect your people,

740
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:05,667
but you can't lose your real family.

741
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,767
I prioritized the hotel over everything

742
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,500
and lost everything in the process.

743
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:20,100
That must not happen to you.

744
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:22,734
You understand?

745
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,200
Grandma.

746
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:38,300
-This is it.
-What do you mean, "This is it"?

747
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:42,000
I was thinking about a promotional event
for the new hotel.

748
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,767
This is it.

749
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,100
Moon-seong's talent can be put to use.

750
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,600
JIN-HYUK, JI-YOUNG,
OUR BEAUTIFUL FUTURE AHEAD…

751
00:57:56,266 --> 00:57:59,500
I got the idea when I saw
the picture you sent Grandma.

752
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,967
So, Se-yeon,

753
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,834
does the event need to be so big?

754
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,734
You can make mistakes. Don't be nervous.

755
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,400
I'm rooting for you.

756
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:18,100
You'll do well.

757
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,367
Excuse me.

758
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:25,667
Could you do that for us?

759
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,867
Yes. Of course.

760
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,333
Hello.

761
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,266
I should have said that earlier.

762
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,800
I'm the calligrapher.

763
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,000
What phrase would you like?
How would you like it?

764
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,467
SPRING HAS ARRIVED
BECAUSE OF YOUR WARMTH

765
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,567
EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END

766
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,166
TAKE THE FLOWERED PATH
FROM NOW ON IN LIFE

767
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,200
THE SUNSHINE WELCOMES US
LET'S MEET IN HEALTH…

768
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:05,033
YOU WILL BLOOM
INTO A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER

769
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:07,266
I think I'm finished.

770
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,900
That's so pretty. Wow.

771
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:13,533
It makes me feel good that you like them.

772
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,934
Sorry, but can you take a picture for us?

773
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,233
A picture? Sure.

774
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,800
Okay, so…

775
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:25,934
Like this?

776
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,166
No, just us two.

777
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,166
We want a picture of us two.

778
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,266
With this.

779
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,600
-You two?
-Yes.

780
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,367
Okay, here we go.

781
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,367
One, two, three. Here we go.

782
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,233
-Thank you.
-That's a good one.

783
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,600
-Wow.
-So cute.

784
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,100
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

785
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,300
This isn't so bad.

786
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:01,233
This isn't so bad at all.

787
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:15,467
EVENTUALLY,
YOU WILL SHINE UP THERE

788
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:58,567
Can I ask for one as well?

789
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:00,266
Yes, of course.

790
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:02,467
What phrase would you like…

791
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:06,934
Do you work part-time here, Jae-heon?

792
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:47,567
CURTAIN CALL

793
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:50,667
I can't believe I'm meeting you here.
It must be destiny.

794
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,867
Ri Moon-seong, you can fight, can you?

795
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:59,066
-You going to go all the way?
-Do what you can.

796
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,266
I know I won't lose.

797
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:04,867
If we went back to the old days,
do you think we could do better?

798
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,133
I think we could.

799
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,934
-Chairwoman Ja Geum-sun?
-That's my grandmother.

800
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:14,367
Should we run?
Seeing Grandma dying before us,

801
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:15,767
I feel so guilty.
