00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:24,135
This was where I came with Grandmother during our last trip together.

3
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,525
Grandmother told me

4
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,435
she thought that she was the only one waiting,

5
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:39,130
but after thinking about it,

6
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:41,555
you and your father

7
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,555

8

waiting there...

00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,845
for Grandmother.

10
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,695
She said that

11
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,295
only then did she realize that.

12
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,005
Grandmother...

13
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:08,215

I'm done with what I have to tell you.

19
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:28,005
It's up to this point.

20
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,225
Shall we go?

21
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:36,865
Wait.

22
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,795
Let's stay here for just a bit before we leave.

[Final Episode]

You had a good trip?

38
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:27,775
Yeah.

39
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,615
What did he say?

40
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,035
You saw him, too.

41
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,395
He...

42
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,715
doesn't talk much.

43
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,375
What do you think is going to happen?

44
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,285
I don't know. I've said everything I needed to say,

45
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,325
and the rest

46
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,255
is up to him.

47
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,885
You did well.

48
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,695
Hey. You're the grandson of a rich family. Why ramen, of all things?

49
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:50,995
Aigoo, man...

50
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,685
Are you kidding me right now?

51
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,335
So where did you go?

52
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,705
Shall I say...

53
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,065
I went and met Grandmother?

54
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:03,785
What? Wait a sec.

55
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:06,135
Hey. So how did it go?

56
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,075
Huh?

57
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:12,715
Hey, you should finish what you started to say! So frustrating.

58
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,755
Just eat.

59
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,515
Fine, let's eat. Just eat, man.

"Are you doing this because you're my cousin?"

00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,205
"Is that why?"

63
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,905
Do it again, Hyun Joo. Se Yeon is General Manager.

64
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:31,345
- Open your eyes big, okay?
- Okay, got it.

65
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:32,415
One, two, go!

"Who do you think you are?"

67
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,115
Come over here, come here. Say he's Jae Heon.

68
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,395
One, two...

69
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,195
With a bit more emotion. A bit more sincere and honest.

70
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,275
Got that?

71
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,585
Okay, then...

72
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,425
Let's wrap it up for the day. Good work!

73
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,465
<i>Great job, everyone!</i>

74
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,455
We'll meet back here tomorrow.

75
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,635
We'll meet again here tomorrow.

76
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:51,865
Practice, practice! Practice the parts you're having problems with.

77
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,705
Jae Heon, take it easy.

78
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:55,685
Okay, Hyung.

79
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,895
- See you.
- Bye, Hyung.

80
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:57,965
- I'll be heading out.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,375
Hyung, I'll see you tomorrow.

82
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,115
- Well...
- Hey...

83
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,975
Jae Heon.

84
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:08,165
Will we be able to put on this performance?

85
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,075
The date set for our performance already passed a while back,

86
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:14,055
and our theater rental period is coming to an end...

87
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:16,325
Don't worry about it.

88
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,795
I can just extend it.

89
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,495
The actors we cast are asking when the performance is going to start.

90
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,905
They're asking if it's even going on stage and that their contract will expire soon.

91
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,325
No matter how much it costs, if it's delayed,

92
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:30,095
I'll pay them their guarantees, including the overcharges for going past the contract period.

93
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,855
Just tell them to wait. Come on, Hyung!

94
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,435
You tell them to wait, Hyung.

95
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,015
But realistically speaking-

96
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:37,905
Damn it! We're going to do it! Tell them we will!

97
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,695
We're going to do this performance, no matter what!

98
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,395
I'll pay for it, no matter how much it costs.

99
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:45,395
So just tell them to wait, Hyung!

100
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,165
Oppa...

101
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:54,665
Sorry.

102
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:28,495
<i>It's the only thing that I can show you, Grandmother.</i>

103
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,795
<i>You're going to come to see it for sure, right?</i>

104
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,435
<i>Grandmother, you will come and see it, right?</i>

105
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,375
<i>I will...</i>

106
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:42,235
<i>for sure...</i>

107
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,265
<i>Grandmother.</i>

108
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,215
<i>Grandmother?</i>

109
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,255
<i>Grandmother, wait!</i>

110
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,295
<i>Grandmother!</i>

111
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,995
<i>Grandmother!</i>

112
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,715
<i>What am I supposed to do? Grandmother!</i>

113
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,835
Here.

114
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,395
There's usually a better drink than this one here,

115
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:15,465
but it just so happens

116
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:16,505
of all the days,

117
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,675
they don't have that one today.

118
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:24,115
Anyway, this is the most expensive drink I can find tonight,

119
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,935
so give it a try.

120
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,025
Here.

121
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,705
Cheers.

122
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,545
Okay.

123
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,735
What do you think?

124
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,505
It's good, right?

125
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,235
Is it really that important that it's expensive?

126
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:48,955
It's important.

127
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:51,465
Of course, it's important!

128
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,435
Is that everything?

129
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:57,005
What are you asking about?

130
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,795
Is there something you want from me...

131
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,355
Come on, what would I want from you?

132
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,785
Don't you think so?

133
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,465
Oh, actually, there is something.

134
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,505
Cheers!

135
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,515
Oh, thank you!

136
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,675
You sure are having a ball, aren't you?

137
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,095
Who's this guy now?

138
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,655
After getting beaten up like that last time,

139
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,965
you still won't call me?

140
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,415
<i>Shit.</i>

141
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,535
Enjoy your drink.

142
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,025
Shit.

Hey!

You come back here!

00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,585
Hey! Let go of me!

146

You, come over here!

00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,465
Hey! You come over here, too!

148
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,495
Hey!

149
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,075
Let go of me!

Hey!

151
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,545
Gosh!

<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

153
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:10,035
What's with that woman?

154
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,215
That's the mystery.

155
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,425
I have no idea who she is.

156
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:16,665
She's nowhere in my memories.

157
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:18,345
I really want to know, too,

158
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,005
but no matter how hard I try, I can't remember her.

00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,575
I don't know who she is!

160
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,555
You're a playboy, I see.

161
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,635
I'm not a playboy.

162
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,595
Call me a Romanticist.

163
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,475
Romanticist, my foot.

164
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,445
What about you?

165
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:39,695
Are you married?

166
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,645
Well...

167
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:42,845
"Well..."

168
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,395

00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:28,782
Move!

336
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,392
Damn it!

337
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:48,402
You sons of bitches!

338
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,032
In the heavens above,

339
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:15,662
there won't be any 38th Parallel, right?

340
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:19,632
When we...

341
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:23,102
meet in the heavens above,

342
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:25,712
let's have...

343
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,292
a drink together for sure.

344
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,802
Hello?

345
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:50,262
Are you here?

346
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:51,642
Hello.

347
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,562
Hello...

348
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:56,582
I really enjoyed your performance.

349
00:26:56,602 --> 00:27:00,002
And you're very fluent in your North Korean dialect.

350
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:01,542
Oh, well...

351
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,052
Thank you.

352
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,852
Jung Sang Cheol?

353
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:22,102
Do you want to put on a play with me?

354
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:25,202
On a large and beautiful stage

355
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,572
that can change your life?

356
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:30,062
Manager, Manager!

357
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:32,082
Hurry, hurry!

358
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:33,372
Here!

359
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,722
She's the one I mentioned last time.

360
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,102
Rhee Moon Sung's wife.

361
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:40,332
I am Jang Jin Sook.

362
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,832
She will play your wife?

363
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:44,392
That's right.

364
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:46,952
Listen carefully.

365
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:50,902
You need to know some basic information about what characters are going on stage.

366
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,032
First,

367
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:57,282
the eldest young master, Park Se Joon.

368
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:59,672
If there's anyone who would be suspicious of you guys in the family,

369
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:02,702
he would probably be the first.

370
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:06,202
The dangerous guy.

371
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:10,082
And the second young master,

372
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,522
Park Se Gyu.

373
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:13,152
He's unpredictable.

374
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:16,842
Just the fact that you two showed up will make him mad.

375
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:20,072
He's the transparent second child of a rich family.

376
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:21,972
The weird guy.

377
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:23,572
And...

378
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:26,422
the youngest lady, Park Se Yeon.

379
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:30,202
Although she looks like a haughty career woman, she's warm-hearted

380
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:32,402
and considerate.

381
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:35,202
The good guy.

382
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,602
I mean,

383
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:41,102
the good noona.

384
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:48,052
I'm only saying this because Grandmother is not here,

385
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:50,362
but if I didn't hear about Grandmother's situation,

386
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:53,142
I wouldn't have even come here.

387
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:58,902
Isn't a family made through the time spent together?

388
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,602
But still, she's the only family I've got left

389
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:03,412
and she's my grandmother.

390
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:06,102
So, at least until she passes away,

391
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:09,002
I'm thinking of doing my part as a grandson.

392
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,532
Grandmother, it's so good!

393
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,312
Oh, really?

394
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,092
Is it good?

395
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,802
Grandmother...

396
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,402
<i>How is it so delicious?</i>

397
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:28,002
<i>Is the water also sweet in the South?</i>

398
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:34,112
<i>I-I was able to build my hotel by selling this rice soup.</i>

399
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:36,442
All right.

400
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,822
You guys did well.

401
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,612
Let's continue to do just like today. Like today.

402
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,042
Nice.

403
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,342
Ahjussi, you're going through a LOC.

404
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:46,682
Right?

405
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:47,872
What's a LOC?

406
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,512
A LOC, a LOC.

407
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:51,342
Loss of Character.*
(Slang for being unexpectedly different)

408
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,042
What does that even mean?

409
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,932
Hey, you guys should use the North Korean dialect.

410
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,252
Isn't that what I'm paying you for?

411
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:00,692
We're sorry. We'll work hard!

412
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:09,002
Aigoo, Grandmother.

413
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:12,672
It would've been nice if you got on my back when I told you to.

414
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:14,792
<i>Hey.</i>

415
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,612
<i>Your grandfather told me</i>

416
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:18,492
<i>he will cross over here</i>

417
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:21,632
<i>from way over there.</i>

418
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:25,872
<i>Whenever I looked across the edge of the ocean vacantly,</i>

419
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:28,742
<i>I felt like your grandfather and your father</i>

420
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:33,572
<i>would come crossing over here on a boat.</i>

421
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:41,182
I would think to myself that I could almost see a boat carrying the two of them,

422
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:45,282
the sun would set before you know it.

423
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:50,492
Should we just run away?

424
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:53,172
We just have to exit those doors.

425
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:57,502
We would return to our lives as Yoo Jae Heon and Seo Yoon Hee.

426
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,682
No.

427
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:01,512
I want to...

428
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,772
do this properly to the very end.

429
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,362
So that Grandmother

430
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:12,902
can keep all of this as real memories before she passes away.

461
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:47,042
I will now reveal Chairwoman Ja Geum Soon's will.

462
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:50,002
"I leave 10 percent of all my inheritable assets

463
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:53,302
to Jung Sang Cheol and Yoon Jung Sook.

464
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:58,152
I will have the rest of my assets distributed equally among my direct descendants listed below.

465
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:01,902
Park Se Joon, Park Se Gyu, Park Se Yeon,

466
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:04,472
and Rhee Moon Sung."

467
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,682
The contents of this will are pretty simple,

468
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,032
but there is a special clause.

469
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:16,242
"Until Rhee Moon Sung is naturalized as a South Korean citizen,

470
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:18,662
the assets that Rhee Moon Sung will inherit

471
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,702
will be placed under the trust of Jung Sang Cheol."

472
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,432
Based on the will,

473
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,962
the Trustor, Chairwoman Ja Geum Soon, and the Trustee, Jung Sang Cheol

474
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:31,502
have already signed a contract regarding this matter.

475
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:34,422
Please be aware of this.

476
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,032
Boy, there are so many hard terms here.

477
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:38,592
What does this mean?

478
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,912
As the attorney said,

479
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:44,092
as the trustee, Rhee Moon Sung's assets

480
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:45,912
are placed in my trust.

481
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:47,002
Also,

482
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:50,342
until Rhee Moon Sung is naturalized as a South Korean citizen,

483
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:53,102
he cannot receive his portion of the inheritance.

484
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:56,262
These assets are also something that I cannot use freely,

485
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:58,472
so I'm letting you guys know in advance

486
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:02,242
that I will not sell the hotel shares and inherit them as is.

487
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:03,892
Oh, I see!

488
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:07,092
Now I fully understand.

489
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:14,802
Then, I guess I remain as the second son of the Nakwon Hotel.

490
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,322
I guess so.

491
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:20,842
[General Manager Park Se Yeon]

492
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:32,512
<i>Because I feel like I know why Se Joon hates Nakwon,</i>

493
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:35,372
<i>I can't step in.</i>

494

It's just different from what I expected.

Don't even mention it.

I found out through going through this past ordeal,

but it turns out that the time spent together...

That time is important.

565

Since the fact that you and I are families doesn't change...

Since a family bond

567

All right,

575
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:12,388
the reason why I gathered all of you here

576
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:16,738
is to tell you that this place will be your new home,

from where you will practice and put on performances.

578

W-Wait, Hyungnim. How long are you renting this theater?

579
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,148
What's a theater rental?

- A theater rent-
- Oh, oh. Okay.

581
00:43:27,998 --> 00:43:31,688
The theater owner said he wasn't getting much business and put it up for sale.

582
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:33,978
So, I just bought it.

W-W-Wait!

585
00:43:39,558 --> 00:43:42,628
H-Hyungnim, then what performance are we putting on here?

586
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:43,798
That's the dilemma-

587
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:45,578
What was that one you did last time?

588
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:46,668
- The last one?
- "The Stage of Friendship."

589
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:47,788
- "The Stage of Friendship."
- Yeah, "The Stage of Friendship."

But in such a small space like an attic...

593
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:54,528
"Hey, die! Die!" If you do that,

594
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:56,678
who's going to come to watch that?

595

Let's expand the scale.

But what's that?

655
00:46:38,468 --> 00:46:39,518
The wedding invitation.

656
00:46:39,518 --> 00:46:41,348
I mean,

657
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:44,858
you've managed to protect the hotel because of Sang Cheol ahjussi,

658
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:46,568
and you no longer need Dong Je's shares.

659
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:49,078
So doesn't that mean you don't have to marry him anymore?

660
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:51,708
That's right.

661
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,338
Then why are you even thinking about it?

662
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:56,728
Are you going to do it?

663
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:58,988
No.

664
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:00,378
Then?

665
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:05,188
I want Dong Je to know.

666
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:09,198
I don't get it because I haven't completely sobered up, right?

667
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:12,488
I feel like you guys are such complicated people.

668
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:28,698

What are you talking about, Hyungnim?

672

Let's have you go back to China

673

and settle things there

674

return to China.

What?

681
00:48:06,948 --> 00:48:10,308
I went through hell to bring him here.

682
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:13,048
But take him back? What if he doesn't return? Then go back and bring him back again?

683
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:14,448
Come on!

684
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,688
I'll compensate you for the work.

685
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,328
I mean...

686
00:48:21,328 --> 00:48:23,168
You're sure of this, then?

687

Gosh, I'm telling you, he's unpredictable.

688
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:29,678
I'll go.

689

Please take good care of me.

When you return to South Korea,

691

I'll be the one to pick you up, then.

she's probably gone to a good place, right?

What are you saying? Of course, she did.

I mean, well...

Not yet.

00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:52,338
You like her, Oppa.

How did you know?

Yeah.

It won't be easy.

It seemed like she liked you as a cousin.

Hey, you...

716
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,428
That's why I need to approach her as a man.

717
00:50:20,428 --> 00:50:22,618
It still won't be easy.

Gosh. What do you know?

Of course!

that you were going to give it your all.

Soon, you're going to get rejected badly

738
00:51:21,108 --> 00:51:24,088
and you'll end up waiting long and hard for me.

Gosh! The way you're looking at me as a friend...

742

I don't like it at all. It's so annoying!

Hey!

744

Are you sad that you couldn't sell the hotel?

745
00:52:19,248 --> 00:52:20,728
Yeah, it's a shame.

746
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,218
Do you regret it?

747
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:24,858
Since the one to move Grandmother's heart

748

was Se Yeon in the end...

749
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:29,748
Since she managed to protect it,

750

A trip?

758
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:53,338
How about a place like Europe?

Let's go.

762
00:53:00,998 --> 00:53:01,758
Really?

763
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:02,918
I do want to rest a little, too.

Wait, what should I prepare first?

769
00:53:15,118 --> 00:53:16,378
Honey?

770

Just hold on a moment.

771
00:53:19,928 --> 00:53:22,978
Yes. Next, we need to talk about changing the amenities.

772
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:27,668
The most important thing is to produce a product that satisfies everyone

773
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:30,008
while meeting the standards and image of our hotel.

774
00:53:30,008 --> 00:53:33,268
This is a product that has met all of those requirements

775
00:53:33,268 --> 00:53:34,658
and has finished testing.

776

Despite our strict configuration requests,

777
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:38,418
they told us definitively that they can

778
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:40,078
deliver the goods as ordered.

779
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:43,078
Even the ingredients and the container are eco-friendly,

780
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:46,348
so they align with our identity.

781
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,898
I feel like it will have a positive impact on the hotel's standards and service.

782
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:52,248
It's nice.

a lot of issues with this.

What are you doing?

790

Since we've already broken it off once,

it's not that difficult to do so a second time.

Don't worry about my shares.

793

I'll sell them to you.

794

I don't like suffering losses,

Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

798

Someone told me

that I just wanted to fix a blemish from the past.

800
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:51,838
I guess I was stubbornly pushing because

801
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,728
I didn't want to admit my mistake.

That I wasn't able to protect you and your family from my family.

805
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:16,888
I couldn't step in even though I knew that my family was looking down on you.

806
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:20,238
Back then, I was afraid of my family.

807
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:23,658
I was cowardly back then.

808

I'm sorry.

You finally realized it, Bae Dong Je.

Hey, Park Se Yeon. I haven't seen that expression on your face for a long time.

I heard you called off the marriage with Se Yeon.

815

Oh, that?

816
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,738
I guess I'm addicted to trying to get married to Se Yeon.

00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:15,818
What are you talking about?

818
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:18,018
I'm going to try again,

819
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,968
but properly this time.

820
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:21,298
What about the shares?

821
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,268
I sold them to her.

822
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:31,978
You got slashed.

823
00:56:33,228 --> 00:56:35,538
I told you to be careful.

824
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:40,058
You thought you were gripping the hilt of the sword,

825
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:42,248
but perhaps you were gripping the blade.

826
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:48,398
Hyung.

827
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:53,338
Is there a reason why you must sell the hotel?

828
00:56:55,148 --> 00:56:57,948
You had a reason when you started,

829
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,298
but as you kept chasing after it,

830
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:03,768
you started focusing on the chase regardless of the reason.

831
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,668
Was it something like that?

832
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,338
I'm just saying.

833
00:57:11,968 --> 00:57:13,978
Both you and me...

834
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:16,578
I felt like we were both in the same place.

835
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:40,468
I'll be going now.

836
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:45,638
Make sure you're a star by the time I come back, Star Yoo.

837
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,438
Be on your way.

838
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:53,638
When you return,

839
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:56,838
make sure you return as Attorney Seo.

840
00:57:57,898 --> 00:58:01,998
"Aigoo, Attorney Seo!"

841
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:03,718
So that I can say that.

842
00:58:05,238 --> 00:58:07,088
I'm leaving.

It's Yoo Jae Heon.

Is it Yoo Jae Hyun or Heon?

859
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:32,058
Yoo Jae Heon, it's Heon.

860
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:34,138
You probably go through a lot while performing in theater.

861

Oh, okay.

I'll see you around.

864
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:47,148
I don't think I want that.

865

You're quite the consistent bastard.

867

Yes.
