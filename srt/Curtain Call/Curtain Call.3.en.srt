1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,567
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,433
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,333
Ma'am, they are here.

4
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:03,533
This is Ri Moon-seong,
and this is his wife.

5
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,066
Moon-seong.

6
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,300
You're alive.

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,734
Thank you.

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,333
How handsome you are, my grandson.

9
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,467
Grandma, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,767
I was a child when I saw you last.

11
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,533
My memories from that time
have faded quite a bit.

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,834
Comrade Jin-suk was

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,967
the only family I had in my life.

14
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,633
When I heard you were looking for me,

15
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,367
I wanted to see you…

16
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,867
Comrade Moon-seong is so nervous.

17
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,867
This is our first visit to South Korea,
so we feel out of place.

18
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,467
We're scared a bit.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You've come farther
than anywhere else in the world.

20
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,633
I'm so excited to see you
that I forget myself.

21
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,533
Let's take our time
to get to know each other.

22
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,700
Let's go in.

23
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,600
Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,200
So, I'll leave you all to it.

25
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,400
Listen carefully.

26
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,767
You need to learn

27
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,000
basic character profiles.

28
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:03,567
Her first grandson is Park Se-jun.

29
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,767
He is calm and collected.
He's a rational man.

30
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:11,800
If anyone in this family suspects you,
he will be the first.

31
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,433
A dangerous dude.

32
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,066
And her second grandson

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,100
is Park Se-gyu.

34
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,066
He's unpredictable.

35
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,533
I'm sure he's mad at you
just for showing up.

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,467
He's not the type to hide feelings,
so it's easy to read him.

37
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,433
A typical spoiled rich kid.

38
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,700
You won't see him often. Just ignore him.

39
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,633
The odd one out.

40
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,967
And the youngest granddaughter
is Park Se-yeon.

41
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,400
She seems like a haughty career woman

42
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,934
but is warm and considerate.

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,967
If anyone can help you in this family,
it will probably be her.

44
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,033
The nice guy.

45
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,467
A nice lady.

46
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,300
I'm saying this
because Grandma isn't here.

47
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:12,266
If I didn't know her situation,
I wouldn't have come here.

48
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:20,200
What makes family is how much time
we spend together, right?

49
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:27,934
I can't say that I feel
any particular bond with you as family.

50
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,767
But Grandma is the only family
I have left.

51
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I just want to do what a grandson should
before she passes.

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
I heard she's very ill.

53
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:50,133
We'll stay here until she passes away.

54
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,800
We don't want to step on anyone's toes.

55
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh, is that so?

56
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:06,600
Hey, little cousin, you're so thoughtful.

57
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,100
Se-jun! Se-yeon! They're pretty nice.

58
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:18,233
Which wealthy family would welcome
a stranger into their family?

59
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,433
They'd be nervous
that he'd take what's theirs.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,266
Exactly.

61
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,033
We'll stay as long as Grandma is alive.

62
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,300
After her passing, we'll be gone for good.

63
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:35,233
It's critical to set the tone that way
from the start to avoid tension.

64
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,333
You're right.

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,533
That way, they'll lose interest
and ask fewer questions.

66
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,433
They'll tell us to have a good time
with Grandma and leave.

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,066
Make yourself at home while you're here.

68
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,567
-Let us know if you have any questions.
-No, Moon-seong.

69
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,834
Mind if I call you Moon-seong?

70
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,200
No, I don't.

71
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,767
So, is that okay?

72
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,300
I meant, "It's okay."

73
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,166
Okay, Moon-seong,

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,967
I want you to live with us.

75
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,300
You went through so much coming here.
I want to do everything I can for you.

76
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,266
It may be presumptuous of me to say this:

77
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:29,266
Wouldn't this place be a little nicer
than where you live?

78
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,667
Sorry, Se-yeon.

79
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:33,500
Shouldn't we discuss the matter
among ourselves first?

80
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,900
You can adjust to life here
by living with us.

81
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:43,500
I know you're just being kind,
but I'm grateful.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,567
I'll do my best while I stay here.

83
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,934
Thank you, Miss Park.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Let's be on a first-name basis.

85
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:59,066
After all, we're cousins,
which means we are closely related.

86
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,166
Let's eat. You must be hungry.

87
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,333
Ma'am.

88
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,900
What about you, Grandma?

89
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,834
I'm fine.

90
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,000
Dig in.

91
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,900
Okay.

92
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,066
Wow.

93
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,033
Wow!

94
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,467
Excuse me.

95
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,200
Grandma, this is so good!

96
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah? Do you like it?

97
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I love it.

99
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,934
Is it the water in South Korea?

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,467
This is the best gukbap I've ever eaten.

101
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,033
I built my hotel selling this rice soup.

102
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Really?

103
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,033
Grandma, can I have one more bowl?

104
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,633
Sure, sure.

105
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,367
I'll get it for you.

106
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,633
Sit tight.

107
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Let me.

108
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,834
Jin-suk, how was it? Wasn't it good?

109
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
It's amazing.

110
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,033
Careful. It's hot.

111
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,266
How were you able
to come down to the South?

112
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,967
In South Korea…

113
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,934
Comrade Sang-cheol helped us,

114
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,133
so that everything went smoothly.

115
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:57,633
Still, I can't believe it's that simple
to defect from the North to the South.

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
Weren't you interviewed by NIS?

117
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,800
It's not like you booked a flight
and entered this country as tourists.

118
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,533
I guess.

119
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:19,700
You see,
many North Koreans are not registered.

120
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,266
By the way, I'm Korean-Chinese.

121
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,133
He was able to obtain Chinese nationality
as the head of my household.

122
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,100
We were so lucky.

123
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,967
That's how we entered South Korea easily.

124
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,633
If you all keep your mouth shut,

125
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,967
we'll be fine.

126
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,467
Korean-Chinese?

127
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:45,633
I see.

128
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:53,633
If we knew you were in China,
we would have found you sooner.

129
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,166
I'm sorry it took longer.

130
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,300
It's all right, Grandma.

131
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm just glad that I've met you at last.

132
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,200
Last time I saw you

133
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:13,734
at the Divided Family reunions,
you were yea big.

134
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:21,900
You and I made a pinky promise
to see each other again.

135
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,734
Do you remember

136
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,600
what you told me?

137
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,333
Well, Grandma,

138
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:49,834
I guess I was too young

139
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,867
to remember.

140
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,433
You know,

141
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,266
I remember one thing:

142
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,467
that I was scared.

143
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:17,033
I didn't realize it
when I was holding your hand.

144
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,767
When I let your hand go,

145
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,633
there were so many people
coming and going,

146
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,367
and they all seemed so big.

147
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,667
At the time, I was so little.

148
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,166
After letting go of your hand

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,533
and watching you walk away…

150
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,900
I wished you had held my hand again.

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,533
But I couldn't tell you that.

152
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,633
That's one thing I remember.

153
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,166
I'm sorry…

154
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,734
that I got emotional at the table--

155
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,900
This is your place to stay.

156
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,633
Thank you.

157
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,667
-Good job. Leave the rest to me.
-Okay.

158
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,767
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ri.

159
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,533
Me? Oh, no. No need to thank me.

160
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,467
-Rest well.
-Yes, ma'am.

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,333
That was intense.

162
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah. You totally nailed it.

163
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:21,867
Keep it up.

164
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,767
You broke character, though.

165
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,033
What does that mean?

166
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,467
Breaking character.
Acting like your real self.

167
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,133
You didn't look like you would.

168
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,834
I haven't seen her so happy in a while.

169
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,800
It exceeded my expectations.

170
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,734
Let me go see what's going on
with the family.

171
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,834
Get some rest. Great job.

172
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:05,266
Grandma looked so happy.

173
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,834
I've never seen her laugh like that.

174
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,633
I'm happy for her.

175
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:16,867
They seem nice enough, right?

176
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,166
Right?

177
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,567
Right?

178
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,667
Go to sleep.

179
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,767
Se-gyu, it's late. Sleep here.

180
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,934
No, thanks.

181
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,834
Why are you so upset?

182
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,433
Why am I so upset?

183
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,700
-That's what you're asking?
-That's right.

184
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,834
Why the hell would you ask them
to live with us?

185
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,633
They're willing to leave.
Why do you insist they stay?

186
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
They are family.
He's Grandma's flesh and blood.

187
00:16:57,867 --> 00:17:00,333
Think of how much she'd want
to take care of him.

188
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,100
Exactly. They can stay until she passes.

189
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,734
Listen to yourself.

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,900
I am.

191
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,633
We have everything, okay?

192
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,100
The haves don't like change.

193
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,367
That's how it is.

194
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,000
-Whatever.
-Sure, whatever.

195
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,233
Good night.

196
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,200
BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE
JEONG SANG-CHEOL

197
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,266
DEPOSIT 250,000,000

198
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:08,400
Wow! Mr. Jeong is as good as his word.

199
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,233
I sent your fee. Go check.

200
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,066
That's a lot for 10%.

201
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,233
Why are you transferring it all at once?

202
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,567
Do you have gambling debts or something?

203
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,600
Comrade, we might be married,
but there are lines that can't be crossed.

204
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,066
Grandma.

205
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:56,967
Are you okay?

206
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,967
I'm okay.

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,166
I'm great.

208
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,967
Honestly, I was a bit worried.

209
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,667
What will he be like?
What will they be like?

210
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,133
You know what? He seems nice.

211
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,700
I have a good feeling about him.

212
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:20,967
So, Se-yeon, I need you to look after him.

213
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,233
You know Se-jun and Se-gyu won't.

214
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,433
He's never been to South Korea.

215
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,033
Show him around Seoul.

216
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,400
Treat him to fine food. Go shopping.

217
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:36,800
Got it.
I'll do whatever he wants to do, Grandma.

218
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:43,800
Now you're all grown up, and you can
take care of your young cousin.

219
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,433
When did you hang this picture?

220
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,967
The bathroom is humongous.

221
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,734
Right.

222
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,100
Why don't you wash up,
while I get some fresh air?

223
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,567
Yeah.

224
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,166
Damn it. What the hell?

225
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,200
All I have is granny clothes and undies
for authenticity.

226
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,834
This will do for now.

227
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:48,667
Yoo Jae-heon, I'm more stressed.

228
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:54,133
Because I have two objectives
for this charade.

229
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,100
Have a seat.

230
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:06,166
I received the money.
Thank you for the quick transaction.

231
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,767
It was good, for the first day.

232
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:18,200
I almost believed that I was at
a family reunion with the chairwoman.

233
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,133
I wonder why.

234
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,767
Maybe because it was so genuine.

235
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,767
I'll be back in a moment.

236
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,834
Stay put and wait for me.

237
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,667
Okay, Mom. Come back quickly, okay?

238
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,133
Do you have to go?

239
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,700
Can I go with you?

240
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,433
I'm sorry.

241
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,767
Mom!

242
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,100
Mom!

243
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,033
I suppose

244
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,633
what I felt back then is similar

245
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,266
to how young Moon-seong must have felt.

246
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,867
You're very calm about it.

247
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,300
It's fine now.

248
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm old enough to think that
Mom must have had her own reasons.

249
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,033
We all have our reasons, you know?

250
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,800
Ms. Ja does too.

251
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,200
And you too.

252
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:08,266
Me?

253
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,200
What are you doing?

254
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,200
I won't be comfortable.
I'll sleep on the couch.

255
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,166
No way!

256
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,200
What if the housekeeper sees you

257
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,266
and wonders if our marriage is in trouble?

258
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Come on.

259
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,300
You're right.

260
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,767
Here. Lie down.

261
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,166
Good job today.

262
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,233
You did well too.

263
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:16,433
Good night.

264
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,433
Yeah.

265
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,133
Good night.

266
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:43,867
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,033
Mom!

268
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,166
Mom!

269
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,233
Good morning.

270
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,834
Good morning, Comrade.

271
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,800
You're calling me Comrade?

272
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:25,400
You live with us now.
You can call me Se-yeon.

273
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,133
-Sorry?
-Just call me Se-yeon.

274
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,767
I was the baby of the family all my life
before you came.

275
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,133
Let me be a big sister for once. Okay?

276
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,133
No. I don't think so.

277
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Try it.

278
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,500
I've never done this before.

279
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:50,967
Se-yeon--

280
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,700
All right, Moon-seong.

281
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,333
Trust your big sister.

282
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,867
Okay.

283
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,233
I feel safe!

284
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,500
I'm keeping my word
and showing you around Seoul today.

285
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,400
No, no! You don't have to.

286
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,767
You've traveled peaks and valleys
to get here.

287
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,567
I'm going all out for you today. Let's go.

288
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,333
Well, maybe next time.

289
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Follow me.

290
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:21,800
Just hang on…

291
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,433
That bastard.

292
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,233
Wait a minute!

293
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
It's fine!

294
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,500
Don't worry about it.

295
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,333
Get in!

296
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,000
Come on!

297
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,233
The beginning of this is very important.

298
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,300
The family will take interest in you
because you're new.

299
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,066
They will ask questions.
They will take you to places,

300
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,767
to a lot of functions.

301
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,367
Will they accept us that easily?

302
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,967
-What do you mean?
-Think about it.

303
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:05,367
A stranger shows up out of the blue
and says he's long-lost family.

304
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:08,066
It'd be strange
if they were open-minded about it.

305
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,367
Se-yeon needs to have you on her side.

306
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,600
She'll be quite forward with you.

307
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:19,633
Especially you.

308
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,133
Let's go.

309
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,834
Is this door automatic?

310
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,433
What have you prepared?

311
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:51,867
Ms. Ja and her three grandchildren are
all involved in the Hotel Nakwon.

312
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,567
That's right.

313
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:57,066
-I'm going to stay in the house.
-Why?

314
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,333
Traditionally, wives are supposed
to stay home, right?

315
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Moon-seong is the husband,
so he needs to go out.

316
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,433
I'm going to stay home
and keep a very low profile.

317
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,734
I'll let the husband handle
Ms. Ja and her grandchildren.

318
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,433
Who usually stays in the house?

319
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,133
Yoon Jeong-suk has been
the only housekeeper

320
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,433
of this family for 30 years.

321
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,433
She's the only person

322
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,166
Chairwoman Ja trusts.

323
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,133
Good morning.

324
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,433
Hello.

325
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,433
Take a seat.
I'll make you breakfast in a minute.

326
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No worries.

327
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:46,133
May I give you a hand?

328
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,533
Oh, no.

329
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,633
Please. Let me help you with that.

330
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,333
So lovely.

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,867
He must really love you.

332
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:57,967
Sorry?

333
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:01,166
I can tell your husband takes
good care of you.

334
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,600
I'm told you had a rough time
in North Korea,

335
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,033
but you have such soft hands.

336
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,734
Moon-seong sure cares a lot about you.

337
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,567
I'm from China, not North Korea.
I'm Korean-Chinese.

338
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,200
That's right.
You told us you're Korean-Chinese.

339
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:21,433
Have a seat. I'll be right back.

340
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,967
What do you think?

341
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,000
This is Myeong-dong.

342
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,633
Oh, okay.

343
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,734
-Have you heard of Myeong-dong?
-Yeah.

344
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,533
This is Myeong-dong.

345
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,934
This is a hot spot in Seoul
where tourists make sure to visit.

346
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:58,333
Myeong-dong! This is that Myeong-dong?

347
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,667
Thank you.

348
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,533
So good!

349
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,734
Is that roasted corn?

350
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,867
-I used to eat that a lot in the North.
-Two, please.

351
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I feel dizzy.
Everything is dazzling! Incredible!

352
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,767
Do you need anything? I'll buy it all.

353
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,734
No, I'm all right. It's fun to browse.

354
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,400
I know there are things you want.

355
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,900
Looks good.

356
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,533
-Moon-seong.
-Se-yeon.

357
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,734
BAREUN CHICKEN

358
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,900
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

359
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Hey, Brother.
This is something called chicken.

360
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,100
They also have chicken in the North.

361
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,867
We call it fried chicken.

362
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,266
Of course you would have chicken.

363
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,333
Sure, they do.

364
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,333
-Well, let's eat.
-Wait.

365
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,500
Here.

366
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,867
Thank you.

367
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,433
Sister, this is fried--

368
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,633
No, it's real chicken.

369
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,900
Wow. It's delicious.

370
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,600
How did you know?
You guys eat like this up there?

371
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,166
We've never been to the North.

372
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:47,567
The Internet is the only way
we can get information about the North.

373
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:51,233
You just have the details
about some of this.

374
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,066
What should we do?

375
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:58,900
While we live there, they'll be questions
we can't answer.

376
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,400
Hey!

377
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,967
About the details-- I have an idea.

378
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:09,033
The information about North Korea
is too limited.

379
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,367
Neither of us has been there.
No one around us defected to South Korea.

380
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,734
Right.

381
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,900
That means no one knows
what North Korea is really like.

382
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,200
I guess so.

383
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:23,033
But we're the North Koreans
who just arrived here.

384
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,233
-We are?
-No, our characters.

385
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,767
Our characters.

386
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,834
Don't you get it?

387
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,233
We know how things are right now
in North Korea.

388
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:38,867
Whatever we say is reality in North Korea.
Why would they contradict us?

389
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:42,166
That's true.

390
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:45,900
We don't need to know everything
about North Korea.

391
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,133
Just say, "You may not know this,
but in the North…"

392
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,567
"You may not know this, but in the North…"

393
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,934
The way the North Koreans enjoy chicken

394
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,033
is to make our own dipping sauce.

395
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,600
I see. It has an interesting taste.

396
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,467
How do you like it?

397
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:09,700
I love it.

398
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:11,867
Try it yourself.

399
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:16,967
What?

400
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,667
Are we in Euljiro?

401
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,734
Oh, my.

402
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,867
Where are we going?
This place looks dangerous.

403
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,734
Se-yeon, in the North,

404
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,700
good places are on the top
of these kinds of buildings.

405
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:33,967
The government-run ones
are all for propaganda.

406
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:37,567
Many people risk their lives
to run one illegally.

407
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,467
-Those are the real ones.
-Really?

408
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:48,967
Let's go.

409
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,066
What's this?

410
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,000
I told you so! There's one right here.

411
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,166
I had no idea this was here.

412
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,333
Tell me about it.

413
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I guess people from North or South
aren't that different.

414
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,700
This is a nice place.

415
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,367
What would you like?

416
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:18,533
Yes. Iced Americano.

417
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,467
You have iced black coffee
in North Korea too?

418
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,700
Jenny, how is New York?

419
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,800
You're back in Korea?

420
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:52,834
I thought you'd live in New York forever.

421
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,000
Welcome back.

422
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,333
Hyun Ji-won,
the daughter-in-law of this family.

423
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,300
Ex-newscaster,
from a prestigious university.

424
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,700
She's smart,

425
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:07,633
but she's also quite unpredictable.

426
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:13,500
So don't try to get close to her,
or you might get in trouble.

427
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,133
You know what they say.

428
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,567
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

429
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:22,300
Jae-heon might have a hard time
getting close to Se-jun,

430
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,667
but not so for me and her.

431
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:27,834
Party? What party?

432
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:29,633
Wow, girl!

433
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,000
What's the party theme?

434
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,367
Retro style?

435
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,066
Wow, your unique taste
still hasn't changed.

436
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,967
She's going to a party

437
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:48,800
with a retro theme?

438
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,200
Are you enjoying it?

439
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,066
The instant noodles in South Korea--

440
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
I really wanted to eat them.

441
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:12,567
I made a reservation at a fancy restaurant
that serves expensive dishes.

442
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,266
I don't care about that.

443
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,467
Whether food is expensive or cheap,

444
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,667
the best way to enjoy food is
to eat what we want.

445
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,066
Thank you for letting me do what I want.

446
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,800
I will never forget this.

447
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Thank you.

448
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,967
Don't thank me.
My plan for today went all wrong.

449
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,734
But life never goes according to plan,
does it?

450
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,233
You just go where your heart goes,
where your feet can take you,

451
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,333
to enjoy a good life.

452
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:47,967
That's freedom

453
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,633
and democracy.

454
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,734
Why are you staring at me?

455
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:01,467
Nothing.

456
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:05,367
Didn't you have fun today, though?

457
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,600
I really did.

458
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:13,834
Well, I brought you out
so you can have fun.

459
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,633
But I'm the one who had fun.

460
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,500
I wanted you to like me, to be honest.

461
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:28,066
Sorry?

462
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,834
I'm fighting
with my eldest brother right now.

463
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,233
I need people on my side.

464
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:41,734
You have no idea how glad I was to have
another brother come out of nowhere.

465
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,266
Little brother?

466
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,600
Yeah, little brother.

467
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,867
My grandma's been looking for him.

468
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:17,800
He's from North Korea, and he's here now.

469
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,133
I don't understand. How are you related?

470
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,567
He's the son of my father's half-brother.

471
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
Anyway, that's not important.

472
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:36,233
The important thing is,
my grandma considers him a grandson.

473
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,967
No wonder you're upset.

474
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,867
You understand so quickly.

475
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:45,767
Se-yeon doesn't get it.

476
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,266
Isn't it simple math?

477
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,400
What if only the denominator gets bigger
when the numerator stays the same?

478
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,900
The final amount is reduced.

479
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:56,066
Is that so difficult?
But she doesn't get it.

480
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,700
This isn't simple math for Se-yeon.

481
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
For Se-yeon?

482
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,500
That ship has sailed.
There's nothing you can do now.

483
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,633
I can turn the ship back.

484
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,433
We're capable, no?

485
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Ms. Ja just fell asleep.

486
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,633
If you have anything to say to her,
just tell me.

487
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,200
I will let her know
first thing in the morning.

488
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,500
How long do you think she has?

489
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,867
I'm not a doctor.
How would I know such a thing?

490
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,567
Sir.

491
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,400
You never change, Mr. Jeong.

492
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,800
You're more faithful and sincere
than my own family.

493
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:01,700
Should I call this loyalty?

494
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:08,000
You worked a miracle by finding
Ri Moon-seong and bringing him here.

495
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,033
Quite impressive.

496
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,867
I was just lucky,

497
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:17,567
or the chairwoman's desire to meet him
reached the heavens.

498
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,734
What does Ri Moon-seong want?

499
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,200
As he said himself,

500
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:30,000
he wants to be a good grandson
to Ms. Ja before she passes away.

501
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:33,300
It's important to how good of a grandson
he wants to be.

502
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:36,433
I think you misunderstand something.

503
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,767
I'm loyal to the chairwoman,

504
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,000
not to the Hotel Nakwon.

505
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,500
Also, Ri Moon-seong is here as a guest

506
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,100
and will leave as a guest.

507
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,867
You don't have to worry about that.

508
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,033
When I was young, I used to think…

509
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,700
my grandma was divided
into the North and the South.

510
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,166
She was living here in the South with us,

511
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:18,066
but her heart was always
with the family she left in the North.

512
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,800
Get some rest.

513
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,867
What's all this?

514
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,767
Being a husband is hard.

515
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:53,066
You didn't make any mistakes today,
did you?

516
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:55,700
What would you like?

517
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,200
Yes. Iced Americano.

518
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,867
Your hands are so smooth.

519
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:04,367
He must really love you.

520
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,300
Why are you quiet?
You're making me nervous.

521
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:14,800
Yeah, there was this and that,
but I think it went okay.

522
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Me too.

523
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You think?

524
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:24,033
What do you mean?

525
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Man.

526
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:30,633
Mr. Jeong, stop nagging us.
Do you think this is an easy job?

527
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,066
Speak quietly.

528
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:36,800
We used to be ourselves for 22 hours
and act for only two hours.

529
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:40,533
Now we have to act for 22 hours
and be ourselves briefly for two hours.

530
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,700
This is totally different. It's so hard.

531
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,266
I agree.

532
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,400
We have to act in real life.

533
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:49,500
I almost become myself sometimes.

534
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,834
Right?

535
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,834
Am I not paying you to do just that?

536
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Right.

537
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:01,400
You must be tired. Get some rest.
If something happens, call me right away.

538
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,400
-Okay.
-"Okay"?

539
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,700
Speak like a North Korean.

540
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:08,233
I understand.

541
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:16,166
How about you look for someone else
and not waste your time on me?

542
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,333
What?

543
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,667
First off, it's hard to gather
every single lesser shareholder.

544
00:43:21,734 --> 00:43:26,300
Also, stockholders with over 3% stakes
don't have a relationship with us.

545
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,100
How about visiting them to persuade them?

546
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,667
Before Se-jun feels threatened,

547
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:37,867
you have to move fast now, you lazy girl.

548
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,934
Once in a blue moon,

549
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
you're needlessly sharp.

550
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,734
Where?

551
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,700
Pick up the speed.

552
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,333
You told me to speed.

553
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:59,900
Hello.

554
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:02,300
Hi, Ms. Park.

555
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,333
Did you look into it?

556
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:11,900
Keep up the good work.

557
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,667
Ilseong Partners.

558
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,467
It's a private investment company
with equity funds.

559
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,567
But recently, they bought stocks from us.

560
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:25,433
-They have about a 4% stake.
-Four percent?

561
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,800
That's enough to get the votes I need.

562
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,266
That's right.

563
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,233
It doesn't help to take too long
for things like this.

564
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,767
Get them on the line for me.

565
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:36,834
-Okay.
-Yeah.

566
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Hello?

567
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:41,333
Yes, hello.

568
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,166
This is Park Se-yeon
from the Hotel Nakwon.

569
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:47,300
I'd like to meet the CEO
of Ilseong Partners.

570
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:49,333
Hi, Ms. Park.

571
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,900
Excuse me?

572
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,734
Have we met before?

573
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:59,166
Mr. Bae told me you'd call,
so I've been waiting.

574
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,300
What?

575
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,533
This is Cheon Ju-yeong from the general
affairs office in the Wooseong Group.

576
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:15,166
Oh, hi. Come inside.

577
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:33,333
Hey, there.

578
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:37,800
I told you that you'd come see me.

579
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,166
So it's you.

580
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,000
Sit. We have a lot to discuss.

581
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:01,600
Grandma.

582
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,767
Oh, hey. Moon-seong.

583
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:08,233
Can I sit next to you?

584
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,934
Of course. Sit.

585
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,800
Grandma, what's on your mind?

586
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,233
When you get old,
there's nothing to do but think.

587
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,800
Is that right?

588
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,834
My grandchildren feel uncomfortable
around me.

589
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,934
But to be honest,

590
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:44,133
I'm uncomfortable around them too.

591
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,967
So I stay out of the way

592
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,000
and just sit here.

593
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,967
How do you like it here?

594
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:10,867
Everything's good.

595
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,467
Look at this view.

596
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:15,934
It can't get better than this.

597
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,900
I'm glad to hear that.

598
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:23,600
They've never given up anything
for anyone.

599
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,133
I was worried
that they might push you away.

600
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:28,433
I'm just worried about that.

601
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,200
They're all well educated.

602
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:35,633
They're not being offensive or anything.

603
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,066
Se-yeon, especially,

604
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:43,367
treats me very well,
like I'm her real brother.

605
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:44,700
Really?

606
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:46,867
That's a relief.

607
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,767
So, do you need my shares?

608
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:57,233
I do.

609
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,133
For how much?

610
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,400
Name a price.

611
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,200
I will buy it at any price you want.

612
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:10,133
I have plenty of money.

613
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:12,500
I only want one thing.

614
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,200
You know what it is.

615
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:18,934
-Which I'm not interested in.
-What if the 4% went to Se-jun?

616
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,767
You two bastards think alike.

617
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:30,000
My brother would buy stocks from his
sister's ex-fiancé, who was dumped.

618
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:32,633
You would use stocks
to persuade me into marrying you,

619
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:36,066
while you don't give a damn
about the hotel or its history.

620
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:41,600
I'll protect my hotel for reasons
you two would never understand.

621
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,266
For the same reasons, I won't marry you.

622
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:47,000
We'll see about that.

623
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:55,200
I will refund your money
without cancellation fee. So get out.

624
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,767
Ms. Cheon.

625
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:04,600
We will do our office work here.
People can see to me at this place.

626
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,667
-Yes, sir.
-While they're here,

627
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:09,867
tell them they can spend freely

628
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:12,800
when eating at the hotel's restaurants.

629
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,734
-Tell them I said so.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,900
I will tell my staff to give out
discount coupons for the restaurants.

631
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,500
When I think of
my three grandchildren and you,

632
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,200
whom I wasn't sure if I'd ever meet,

633
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,867
I realize now that you guys

634
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,967
were the ones that didn't let me go.

635
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,867
This used to be a gukbap restaurant.

636
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Was it?

637
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:57,567
Your grandfather told me to wait
until he returned.

638
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,900
But the only thing I could do was cook.

639
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:08,233
I was just trying to make a living
by making gukbap.

640
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,300
Ma'am…

641
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:11,867
One day, this customer spoke to me.

642
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,400
…can you rent me a room?

643
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:15,533
He said he had to take an early boat ride.

644
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:21,767
He begged me to rent him a room
just for one night.

645
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:27,000
So I rented a room to that poor man
because I felt bad for him.

646
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,900
Thank you.

647
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,700
Before he left the next morning,

648
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,867
he paid me enough money
for 30 bowls of gukbap.

649
00:51:57,633 --> 00:51:59,667
It was a way to make good money.

650
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,867
That's how I started a hotel business.

651
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:09,233
Without that customer--

652
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,700
I would've sold gukbap my entire life.

653
00:52:15,734 --> 00:52:17,900
-Wow.
-Yeah.

654
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:22,000
HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA

655
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:39,367
Please, I don't have money.
Wait for a bit more.

656
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:54,533
I'm really sorry. I really am!

657
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:02,100
You're so greedy and cruel!

658
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,367
A PARADISE FOR NORTH KOREAN
REFUGEES WHO BEAR THE SCARS OF WAR

659
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,133
Hey.

660
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:52,667
My little sister welcomes me home.

661
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,633
Not too terrible.

662
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,100
Why are you staring at me like that?

663
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,433
-Was it you?
-What?

664
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,667
-You are the spy, right?
-What are you talking about?

665
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,533
You told Dong-jae, didn't you?

666
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:24,100
Dong-jae made you bring up
that stockholder bullshit with me.

667
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:27,066
I know nothing about it.

668
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,533
Get over here! Come here!

669
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:34,567
Hey!

670
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,767
They seem to get along well.

671
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:43,700
They've always gotten along well.

672
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,633
The mood has brightened up
in the house recently.

673
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,867
Don't you think?

674
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:50,934
Has it?

675
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,867
Goodness. Do you like what you see?

676
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
You think you look good, don't you?

677
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:09,734
Not really. I just think this works.

678
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:15,233
I have to dress up nicely
since it's my first visit to the hotel.

679
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,467
She bought me these fancy clothes,
even though I told her not to.

680
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:20,934
I think it would be rude not to wear them.

681
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,433
You must be touched.

682
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,467
-Do you want me to drink this?
-Yes.

683
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,934
Hey, it feels like
we're really husband and wife.

684
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,567
Does it?

685
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,100
You really staying home?

686
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,233
I told you.

687
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,500
It's more likely
that I'll meet someone I know.

688
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:49,500
We were stuck in the same small theater.

689
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,633
Also, I've been doing
more part-time jobs than you,

690
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:56,066
so the chance of me meeting
someone I know is much higher.

691
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,533
My mom and dad are…

692
00:55:58,633 --> 00:55:59,800
What?

693
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,300
Your mom and dad are what?

694
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:11,700
My mom and dad are members
of the Hotel Nakwon.

695
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,767
Good job.

696
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:20,567
I won't be back at the office
for some time, so take care.

697
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:22,133
Yes, sir.

698
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,200
You two bastards think alike.

699
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:40,233
You would use stocks
to persuade me into marrying you,

700
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,133
while you don't give a damn
about the hotel or its history.

701
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:48,000
I'll protect my hotel for reasons
you two would never understand.

702
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:52,166
For the same reasons,
I'm not going to marry you.

703
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,600
Thank you, sir.

704
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,567
How was the drive here?

705
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:50,667
It was fine.

706
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,700
Wait, Se-yeon.

707
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:56,900
The car you sent to pick me up--
What was it?

708
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,700
You know, the big, black car?

709
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,300
The thing with that car is

710
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:05,100
that if I could push back the seat,
I could stretch my legs.

711
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,667
It was such a comfortable ride.

712
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:11,834
-You're the best. Thank you.
-That's great.

713
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,100
Miss Park Se-yeon.

714
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,600
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

715
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:23,734
You seemed close to someone
I've never met before.

716
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:27,900
I see. I will call a manager for you.

717
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,467
I'm off now, and I'm on personal business.

718
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:31,600
Exactly.

719
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,600
I called you because it seemed private.

720
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,300
Well…

721
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,600
-What's going on?
-I'm the man who will marry Miss Park.

722
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:48,767
What?

723
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:52,000
You seem close to the woman
I'm going to marry. Who are you?

724
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,433
CURTAIN CALL

725
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,100
-The man who will marry Miss Park.
-Se-yeon, let's go.

726
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:39,667
I've never seen her like that before.

727
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:43,266
-You could be a singer.
-Wow, really.

728
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,100
You were kidnapped and interrogated?

729
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,967
You'll have to pay double for the risk.

730
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:49,934
-You can stop. I'll pay you the rest.
-What?

731
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What do you want to know?

732
00:59:51,066 --> 00:59:52,600
So, he could be a con artist?

733
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,100
I can breathe now.

734
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,567
You look pretty relaxed, Jae-heon.

735
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:58,767
-I have something to tell you.
-Ta-da.

736
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:00,633
The Eight-Province Excursion Project.
