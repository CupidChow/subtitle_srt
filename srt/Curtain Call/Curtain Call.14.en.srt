1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,450
So...

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,900
he's not my cousin?

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,960
And... she's not my sister-in-law?

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,219
I-Is it true, Co-sister-in-law?

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,550
Say something.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,610
It is as you have heard.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,790
We are... not Rhee Moon
Sung and Jang Jin Sook.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,700
Why did you do something like this?

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,839
I wanted to fulfill the
Chairwoman's final wish.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,429
These guys are not to blame.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,939
All they did was act like a
married couple as I told them to.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,159
If they had any fault, it would
be that they did it too well.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,149
Then...

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,360
who are these guys?

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,250
These guys are...

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,430
We are actors.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,839
Oh, my goodness...

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,740
We are...

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,080
actors.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,350
I'm sorry that we had
to tell you like this.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,670
But...

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,149
I hope that you understand

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,529
that we didn't do this
with any bad intentions.

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,530
Do you think that makes any sense?

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,060
Wait, hold on a sec.

27
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,499
Everybody else knew then.

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,789
Right?

29
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,110
Everybody else except for me and
Sister-in-law knew about it, right?

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,249
Park Se Yeon.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,519
How long have you known this?

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,189
Auntie, if you knew about
it, you should have told me!

33
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,589
Why would you turn me into
a fool like this? Why!

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,209
Am I that untrustworthy?

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,759
I mean, this was done to
make Grandmother happy!

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,129
Did you think that I would
mess it up if I knew?

37
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,379
Did you think I would go to Grandmother and
tell on them, saying these guys are all fakes?

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,209
I was going to have them
return when the time was right.

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,230
I thought it would be best if nobody knew.

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,740
Then... was all of it fake?

41
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,160
Was all of it fake?

42
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,760
It is true that we were acting as someone else,
but everything else was genuine. I mean it, Unni.

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,639
If that person is fake,

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,000
everything that they've
said and done is fake.

45
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,220
Well...

46
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,260
Thank you...

47
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,769
for everything.

48
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,360
And...

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,450
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,499
This is something precious to you, Miss.

51
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,410
How could you leave this behind?

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,880
Thank you.

53
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,310
What I said last time... I meant it.

54
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,709
It's been so long since I saw the
Chairwoman be so happy like that.

55
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,570
Ever since you two came
here, she's been like that.

56
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,620
Thank you.

57
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,770
Now that we're about to leave this place,

58
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,930
I feel a bit wistful.

59
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,170
Yeah.

60
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,960
You had to go through a lot, having
to stay in the same room with me.

61
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,030
Yeah, I did.

62
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,519
I really commend myself.

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,910
Great job, me.

64
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,310
Now...

65
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,570
it's really

66
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,220
the end.

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,979
Let's go.

68
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,320
Yes.

♫ What should I do ♫

70
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,730
♫ Where should I go ♫

00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,759
♫ The days I've wandered ♫

72
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,410

(Ilmiri Geumgye Jjimdak♪)
(Steamed Chicken Dish)

87
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,639
By the way, how are you so good at golf?

88
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,809
It's not a big deal. It
was just basic knowledge.

89
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,579
It's not anything special.

90
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,929
You saw how she completely
lost her mind earlier, right?

91
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,629
I feel so relieved today.

92
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,020
That ahjumma only appears fine on the
outside, but she's completely airhead.

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,369
You heard what that girl
said earlier, right?

94
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,849
Supposedly, her graduating in
the United States was all a lie.

95
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,639
And she always looked
down on her friends...

96
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,659
From today on, she's gone from my life.

97
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,840
Yes, you're right.

98
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:27,479
Because I am so grateful to you, co-sister-in-law,
I'll twirl this cheese around like this...

99
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,690
Open wide!

100
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,780
Wow, it must be so good!

101
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,250
It's not overly salty and flavored lightly.
It's really tasty!

102
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,870
It's all over.

103
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,699
You don't have any work today?

104
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,509
Am I supposed to work all the time?

105
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,439
I need to take a break at times, too.

106
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,229
Aren't you even curious about how your daughter's
been doing after not seeing me for so long?

107
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,110
Why?

108
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,629
Is there something I should worry about?

109
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,580
No.

110
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,129
The last performance that
you were all excited about...

111
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,429
Did that finish?

112
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,230
Yeah.

113
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,610
Mom.

114
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,839
Let's say that there is this case,

115
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,560
and they tell you to wrap it up
because you've done your job.

116
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,419
But for you, there is more
you can and want to do.

117
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,469
What do you do in that type of situation?

118
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,879
What do you mean what would I do?

119
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,889
I would do one of two things.

120
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,540
What are they?

121
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,919
The first option is to wrap it up
because they said my job's done.

122
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,409
Why would you seek out more
work than is necessary?

123
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,460
Then what's the second option?

124
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,459
What do you think?

125
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,979
Just go for it.

126
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,999
Even though they told you your job is done?

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,329
You feel like there is
something you have to do.

128
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,989
If you don't get this done, you feel
bothered by it for the rest of your life.

129
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,499
But I don't recommend this option.

130
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,059
Why not?

131
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,259
Because it's not profitable?

132
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,919
For those types of work, you
end up getting too absorbed.

133
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,009
So, you end up

134
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,559
getting absorbed, getting overly involved,

135
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,759
and getting into other people's business.

136
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,779
Don't you think that's how I ended
up divorced and inattentive to you?

137
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,209
I am saying all of this
out of the experience.

138
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,239
Your feelings?

139
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,050
That's only momentary.

140
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,689
GM, your schedule for today-

141
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,309
Please cancel...

142
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,179
my entire schedule for today.

143
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,459
Well...

144
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,389
should I cancel the meeting
for the wedding as well?

145
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,999
Yes. All of it.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,989
Please cancel all of it.

147
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,340
Yes.

148
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,949
Today's wedding flower meeting

149
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,829
was canceled due to General Manager
Park Se Yeon's personal matters.

150
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,359
What?

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,539
Why?

152
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,829
What's the matter?

153
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,260
Well, the thing is...

154
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,660
Grandmother.

155
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,190
Moon Sung and Jin Sook...

156
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,000
They've left.

157
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,429
You probably didn't know,

158
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,790
but they were actually...

159
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,869
When I look back on it now,

160
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,560
I think they at least tried

161
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,440
to do what they can for you, Grandmother.

162
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,870
Meanwhile, I...

163
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,700
Even though I knew you were
going to end up like this,

164
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,740
I wasn't able to do anything...

165
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,000
I did nothing.

166
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,900
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

167
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm really sorry.

168
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
It's been an honor working with you all.

169
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,710
Are you quitting your job?

170
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,649
- Yeah.
- Then...

171
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,999
is it all over?

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,190
Yeah.

173
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,590
Well, we're thinking of quitting, too.

174
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,899
What?

175
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,239
This is my problem. It has
nothing to do with you, Hyungs.

176
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,919
We are a team.

177
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,819
So when someone goes, we all go.

178
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,929
We originally planned to work here to raise
money for the performance costs anyway.

179
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,799
Also, we should return to our primary job.

180
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,210
Primary job?

181
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,509
Yeah...

182
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,870
Primary job.

183
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,370
We should return to our primary job.

184
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,010
We should go back to our primary job.

185
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,479
Hyung.

186
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,080
Yeah?

187
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,579
Could you pack my stuff for me?

188
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,819
Okay, take care of it if you
have something to tend to.

189
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,379
Yeah, I need to go somewhere.

190
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,610
Thanks, Hyung. I'll leave you to it.

191
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,040
As of today...

192
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,720
As of today, I've
resigned from my position,

193
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,469
so I dropped by to say
goodbye for the last time.

194
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,379
Is today...

195
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,330
the last time?

196
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,960
As Rhee Moon Sung

197
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,460
who worked in the laundry room,

198
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,459
yes.

199
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,000
It is the last time.

200
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,749
I felt like...

201
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,870
I didn't get to properly say goodbye.

202
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,039
Thank you...

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,770
for everything.

204
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,570
Thank you...

205
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,860
for everything.

206
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,540
I knew...

207
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,210
that Grandmother's last day was coming.

208
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,710
And that when that day comes,

209
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,190
I would become sad.

210
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,640
And yet,

211
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,230
why was I not able to treat her better?

212
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,560
Even though I knew...

213
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,840
I told myself she should be fine,

214
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,390
that she'll be fine,

215
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,870
that like a tree that stands
firm even after many years,

216
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,060
Grandmother will still be here.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,300
I guess I believed that
and looked the other way.

218
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,750
To be regretting it only now...

219
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,790
I feel like such an idiot.

220
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,530
Noona,

221
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,530
it's because

222
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,890
you love Grandmother deeply.

223
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,679
The deeper your love,

224
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,109
the deeper your regrets.

225
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,550
So...

226
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,800
it's okay to be sad.

227
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,150
It's okay to feel pain.

228
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,210
Just...

229
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,959
♫ Sometimes, when I think of you ♫

230
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,449
♫ I look at you from either
side of my memories ♫

231
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,389
♫ Sometimes, when I miss you ♫

232
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:44,690
♫ I close my eyes and picture your face ♫

233
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,800
♫ I guess my heart can't forget you yet ♫

234
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:59,820
♫ Why do our short but sweet
memories hurt so much ♫

235
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,909
♫ Was love always this painful ♫

236
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:16,229
♫ Was love always this difficult ♫

237
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:24,230
♫ It's too late to turn back my love... ♫

238
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,020
Where did he go?

239
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,400
CEO Park No Kwang?

240
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,090
CEO Park?

241
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,780
What's he doing?

242
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,739
This is an officially released
car with no accident history.

243
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,570
Whoa, what...

244
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,650
What are you doing?

245
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,199
Gosh, man.

246
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,100
Aigoo, Yoo Star.

247
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,919
- Geez.
- CEO Park, you're known for your passion.

248
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,079
But you're sleeping in a car.

249
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,889
What are you doing? Aren't
you going to sell cars?

250
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,429
Hey, look around.

251
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,799
How come there's not even an ant in here?

252
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,509
Gosh, the economy is so bad these days.

253
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,349
So, are you feeling down?

254
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,819
Yeah, a bit.

255
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,629
Then, do you want to have a bit of a drink?

256
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,270
I want a lot of that.

257
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,110
Are you having a really tough time?

258
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,389
I mean, it's not to that extent.

259
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,350
I'm just so exhausted to death, that's all.

260
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,769
But I still think this.

261
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,329
In life,

262
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,399
you need to hit rock bottom

263
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,769
before you can start rising to the top.

264
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,369
Hey, but what if there's a
basement under that rock bottom?

265
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,389
Why is this bastard saying
such foreboding words!

266
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,219
Your words might become a reality, damn it!

267
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,720
Sorry.

268
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,619
And you. Did what you were doing

269
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,259
end well?

270
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,779
I don't know if this counts as ending well

271
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,329
or not...

272
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,619
It hasn't ended, I see.

273
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,730
What?

274
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,469
You just said you don't know
if it ended well or not.

275
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,810
That means it hasn't ended.

276
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,210
Hey.

277
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,380
If...

278
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,649
let's say...

279
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,599
we want to be good sons to our parents.

280
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,190
Then what would you want to do?

281
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,689
I mean...

282
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,189
we didn't have parents.

283
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,209
That's not true! We
probably had parents once.

284
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,109
Yeah, okay. We probably
had parents somewhere once.

285
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,180
But...

286
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,479
Never mind.

287
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,620
Okay.

288
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,490
What do you do for a living?

289
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,009
Me?

290
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,000
Acting.

291
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:06,069
So what you enjoy doing.

292
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,739
But also what you can do more of,

293
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,359
and what you can do well.

294
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,409
Wouldn't it be for the best to do that?

295
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,129
When did this bastard become an adult?

296
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,580
I can't even catch that.

297
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,900
Forget it. How can we be good sons?

298
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,050
(Stage directions and script)

299
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,929
The stock price graph is
an abnormal upward curve.

300
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,409
From the buyer's point of view,

301
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,159
they may believe that there is a
force that's trying to pump and dump.

302
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,670
In that case, there's a chance
that the sale might fall through.

303
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,200
GM, Director Park Se Joon is here.

304
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,870
You may leave.

305
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,749
If it wasn't anything serious, you
would have talked to me at home.

306
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,280
Right?

307
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,120
The surveying will begin today.

308
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,649
We're going to proceed
with the sale process.

309
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,120
I came to let you know.

310
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,049
Must you do this now?

311
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,469
At least while Grandmother
is still with us,

312
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,669
can't we just get along

313
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,119
- quietly?
- Grandmother...

314
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,119
may not ever wake up.

315
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,529
- Oppa!
- So, we should start settling everything now.

316
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,629
Do you think that makes sense?

317
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,829
We should have done this a long time ago.

318
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,409
It got to this point because
we pushed it back too much.

319
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,919
If we had finished this before,

320
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,970
we could have helped Grandmother
pass away without worry.

321
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,519
You know Rhee Moon Sung
is on my side, right?

322
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,589
No matter what you do
now, you can't stop me.

323
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,729
That's why I'm telling you.

324
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,809
You'll surely get hurt.

325
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,090
But it would be better to
know before you get hurt.

326
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,569
Must you do this?

327
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,440
I've been doing this all along.

328
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,280
You're the one who was resisting it.

329
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,060
Recently, nothing good came out
of our meeting here like this.

330
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,119
What are you going to say this time?

331
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,249
If you'll say something, don't
drag it out and say it. I'm busy.

332
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,169
What could you possibly be busy with?

333
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,520
I don't think that's the point here.

334
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,859
The fake has left.

335
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,319
That means,

336
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,279
there is a real one.

337
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,100
Isn't that right?

338
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,960
You've already found him.

339
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,430
So?

340
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,179
Where is our real cousin?

341
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,759
He'll be here soon.

342
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,669
Amazing...

343
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,569
Just amazing.

344
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,489
Just when I was finding my balance again,

345
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,909
you strike me on the head.

346
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,409
Even for a traffic light, there's a yellow
light between the red and green lights.

347
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,049
Hyung!

348
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,529
Let me regain my place before
you shake things up any further!

349
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,319
He is regaining his place,

350
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,870
at least for that guy.

351
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,639
Then,

352
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,840
does he have a wife?

353
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,609
Well, if there was a fake co-sister-in-law,

354
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,729
I was wondering if there
was a real one as well.

355
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,419
No.

356
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,129
All right, so that Moon Sung... I mean...

357
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,739
the real Moon Sung.

358
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,680
When is he coming?

359
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,250
Right now.

360
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,770
Let's go inside.

361
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,790
Welcome.

362
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,070
You can stay here from now on.

363
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,840
Nice to meet you. I'm Rhee Moon Sung.

364
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,730
We've met before, right?

365
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,550
Our first meeting was a bit violent.

366
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,699
You tried so hard to stop me, then...

367
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,330
In the end, things turned out like this.

368
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,679
You must be pretty upset.

369
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,310
Let me say one thing to you.

370
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,009
It is not that I didn't want you to return.

371
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,329
I just wanted to delay it.

372
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,979
So...

373
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,040
did it go according to your plans?

374
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,390
Since things turned out like
this, let's get along, Comrade.

375
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,049
Since our entire family is
gathered together like this,

376
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,850
we should clear things up.

377
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,869
What do you mean?

378
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,089
- Regarding inheritance.
- Oppa!

379
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,859
I will sell the hotel.

380
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,800
I've already finished talking
about it with Rhee Moon Sung here.

381
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,259
Once Grandmother passes away,

382
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,049
we will receive her inheritance,

383
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,029
and when the two of us
pool our shares together,

384
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,809
you won't be able to stop the sale,

385
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,429
even if you add Dong Je's shares to yours.

386
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,350
Please think it over.

387
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,949
I'm already done discussing it.

388
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,089
It's a waste of time

389
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,730
to talk more about the finished business.

390
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,559
Are you going to just sit
there after hearing this?

391
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,509
I've stepped out of this
picture from the start

392
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,469
and I have no intention
of entering it even now.

393
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,140
Gosh! Geez!

394
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,929
We will have to check how
Grandmother wrote her will,

395
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,739
but Auntie Jung Sook and Manager,

396
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,939
if you receive any
inheritance from Grandmother,

397
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,630
it would be better for you
to sell your shares to me.

398
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,779
You know that Grandmother

399
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,330
doesn't have much time left.

400
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,639
Please think it over and make your
decision before she passes away.

401
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,419
Oppa!

402
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,890
Your words are too harsh!

403
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,710
The Chairwoman's not to blame.

404
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,040
Your parents passing away

405
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,589
so early was also just
an unfortunate accident.

406
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,009
It's not the Chairwoman's fault.

407
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,179
Ahjussi!

408
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,979
Also, Rhee Moon Sung...

409
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,299
How you and your father lived
and suffered in the North...

410
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,239
That's your fate.

411
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,749
And that she's longed for the family

412
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,819
she left behind in the North
rather than you who were with her

413
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,559
is also not your grandmother's fault.

414
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,720
If she committed any sin,

415
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,390
it would be in her longing.

416
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,699
She left behind her family in
North Korea and lost her son.

417
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,500
Holding that pain deep in her heart,

418
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,849
she endured all the blame even
though it wasn't her fault.

419
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,769
Even though it wasn't her fault.

420
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,269
If you want to blame something,

421
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,320
blame your fates!

422
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,100
Why are you hating your grandmother
and despising the hotel she built?

423
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,700
To me, the Chairwoman is a lifesaver

424
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,210
and a mentor who set me
on the path to new life.

425
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,200
While I served her for the past several
decades, I've never seen her act indecently.

426
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,209
I was trash with no relation to her,

427
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,179
but she treated me better than
family, without any prejudices.

428
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,009
But you guys...

429
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,739
You guys are family.

430
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,479
As her family, can't you
understand your grandmother?

431
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,169
Since you guys are family!

432
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,560
Since you are family, you
should understand her.

433
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,119
I planned that ridiculous
and silly performance.

434
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,920
Hoping that the Chairwoman

435
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,859
might spend her last days happy.

436
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,290
Regrets?

437
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,719
If I could just make the Chairwoman happy,

438
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,490
I would do this performance again.

439
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,150
Inheritance?

440
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,280
Look at yourselves.

441
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,349
Your grandmother is still alive!

442
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,890
Must you bring up
inheritance talks right now?

443
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,629
The Chairwoman took on the role
of your late parents as family,

444
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,420
and as your grandmother.

445
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,580
Ungrateful bastards.

446
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,569
♫ Remembering you from that day ♫

447
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,399
♫ In the breaking tides ♫

448
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:39,400
♫ In my wounded state, like
a boulder, I remain here ♫

449
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:50,210
♫ Remembering you from that day ♫

450
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,060
Move!

451
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,989
Do you think I'll let you
commit murder in my hotel?

452
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:08,780
♫ I want to go to that time ♫

453
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,319
♫ You are cold like the sea ♫

454
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,889
♫ Seeming distant though not so ♫

455
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,320
Chairwoman...

456
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:31,619
♫ Whenever I approach you, you
begin to disappear slowly ♫

457
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,400
Thank you.

458
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:43,439
♫ Remembering you from that day ♫

459
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,409
♫ In the breaking tides ♫

460
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,160
♫ In my wounded state, like a boulder... ♫

461
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,230
You may stay here.

462
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,120
If you ever need anything,
please let me know.

463
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,819
This is our grandmother's room.

464
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,910
Isn't it stylish?

465
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,720
If you're done, shall we go back out?

466
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,039
Our house has so many rooms,

467
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,229
so isn't it hard to find your way around?

468
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,479
I'll write the names for you next time.

469
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,359
Grandmother's room here,

470
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,700
and Moon Sung's room over there.

471
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,989
Do you have any plans today?

472
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,879
True, you just arrived not too long ago.

473
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,169
What plans would you have?

474
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,249
Let's go!

475
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,119
This hyung will buy you
something tasty to eat.

476
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,470
Let's go!

477
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,400
Don't act like we're close.

478
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,870
Wow, this makes me feel so small.

479
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,329
Sorry.

480
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,939
I was a bit too hasty.

481
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,579
But will you keep this up with your family?

482
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,360
You and me?

483
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,179
If we are family,

484
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,520
it sure is true that the
family is worse than strangers.

485
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,309
Yeah.

486

00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,009
Well, rather than just fun...

654
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,229
W-W-Well, it is fun. It's just
that it takes a lot out of you.

655
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,249
Is it that difficult?

656
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,039
Not necessarily physically exhausting,

657
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,859
but more mentally.

658
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,499
You need to consider all sorts of
things and observe other people...

659
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,639
It's just that...

660
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,179
after hearing what Grandmother said,

661
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,789
I've been thinking about my future.

662
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,009
As for me,

663
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,369
I'd be happy as long as it's fun.

664
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,599
But then,

665
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,169
seeing you

666
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,550
made me think acting could be fun.

667
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,479
So I'm asking you what you think
about me becoming an actor.

668
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,749
Answer me quickly.

669
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,949
Oh, it appears...

670
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,879
you're going off on a whim.

671
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,109
I'm actually pretty serious.

672
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,989
Acting is not as easy as you might think.

673
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,029
Why?

674
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,380
Gosh...

675
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,949
So you don't become an actor
by just being good at acting.

676
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,649
Then?

677
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,939
Maintaining one's livelihood.

678
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,760
It's so hard to maintain your livelihood.

679
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,829
Movies, dramas...

680
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,239
Let's say you got cast.

681
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,909
It's great, right? But it's a minor role.

682
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,059
What can you do? You do it.

683
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,030
A performance?

684
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,079
You do it intensely for a
month and then a hiatus.

685
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,579
One-month performing, then a hiatus,
one-month performing, then a hiatus...

686
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,289
Because you keep repeating that pattern,

687
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,849
you can't get a stable job.

688
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,730
Well, I pass that test.

689
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,289
That has nothing to do with me.

690
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,289
I can do nothing for the rest of my
life and still be financially well off.

691
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,740
You know all that already. Next.

692
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,899
Hyungnim.

693
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,750
The really important thing is

694
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,559
your mental fortitude.

695
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,509
Having mental fortitude
is the most important.

696
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,789
You know I'm not that sensitive
about things like that.

697
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,990
Next.

698
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,600
Time.

699
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:18,719
You really don't know how
much time it might take.

700
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,859
One year? Nope.

701
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,029
Two years? Come on.

702
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,539
10 years, 20 years, 30 years...

703
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,100
I pass that test, too.

704
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,769
I have too much time on my hands.

705
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,729
The things I have the most of?
Money and time.

706
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,660
I have so much time

707
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:30,889
that I spend my own money

708
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,719
to waste some of my spare time.

709
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,139
You know that, right?

710
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,560
Give me a sec.

711
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,030

712
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,230
Yeah.

713
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,179
Would you like to

714
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,330
participate in a performance?

715
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,569
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right!

717
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,079
All right. Joining us starting today,

718
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,529
- this here is-
- I am a new actor, Park Se Gyu.

719
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,719
If you need anything, please let me know.

720
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,039
Surprise!

721
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,259
Aren't you surprised?

722
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,659
What a shock, right?

723
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,119
Park Se Gyu will play
the role of Park Se Gyu!

724
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,259
Isn't that a great idea?

725
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,799
- What a great idea, right? Why?
- Yeah, yeah, it's good.

726
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,299
Isn't it an appropriate casting?

727
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,069
- Yeah, yeah, it's great!
- It's pretty good, right?

728
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,999
- Everyone, applause!
- It's not bad, right?

729
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,859
Park Se Gyu will play Park Se Gyu!

730
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,259
Wait a sec...

731
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,789
- Sister-in-law, just one sec.
- You guys carry on.

732
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,239
Hyung, isn't it awesome?

733
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,959
It's my idea. Park Se
Gyu playing Park Se Gyu.

734
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,629
Yeah, it's great. It's great, but...

735
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,569
from the perspective of someone
who's just getting into acting,

736
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,979
for me to act the role of myself...

737
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,509
Park Se Gyu acting as Park Se Gyu...

738
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,069
Isn't that a bit off?

739
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,249
The thing is...

740
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,929
I want to portray a proper role.

741
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,879
I want to visit a place

742
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,339
and observe a character,

743
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,990
then express that.

744
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
Is it because you don't
get a lot of scenes?

745
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:05,329
That's not it!

746
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,280
Who do you take me for!

747
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,529
Then do you have a different role in mind?

748
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,959
Me?

749
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,789
Jae Heon's entrance.

750
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,469
It's Pyeongyang-style dumpling soup.

751
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,899
Please try it.

752
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,889
Oh, my goodness! This is so good.

753
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,209
Ms. Ji Hyun, wait, wait.

754
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,489
Please lower the pitch when
you say, "Oh, my goodness!"

755
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,359
Oh, my goodness... Oh, my...

756
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,919
A bit more rounded and vaguely.

757
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,639
"Oh, my goodness..."

758
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,399
Ma'am, the role of Ms. Geum Soon is...

759
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,279
Geum Soon is always upright

760
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,700
but lacks energy.

761
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,949
What do you think? Do you like it?

762
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,689
Whoa, yes. It's really nice.

763
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,219
- If you like it-
- This is...

764
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,479
I'll reserve this theater. Yes.

765
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,710
Thank you.

766
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,239
Stand like this. Hold out your hand.

767
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,899
Bend your knees and lower your hands.

768
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,789
If I take your side,

769
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,959
Hyung will hate me.

770
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,650
But if I take his side,

771
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,430
you will hate me.

00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,290
- I'd like a bowl of rice soup, please.
- Yes.

815
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,359
Your rice soup is here.

816
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,540
Please enjoy your food.

817
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,010
Aren't you Comrade Geum Soon?

818
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,120
Who could this be!

819
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,309
Wow!

820
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,340
It's really good!

821
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,419
Comrade Geum Soon, your
cooking skills are top-notch.

822
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,210
Oh, thank you.

823
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,299
Didn't you say you were in Gyeongseong?

824
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,479
How come you are here...

825
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,059
Oh, that... well...

826
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,600
I was.

827
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,849
But...

828
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,680
how come you are here, Comrade Geum Soon?

829
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,150
I just had some things happen
that I needed to come here.

830
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:50,020
Coincidence is quite a fascinating thing.

831
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,530
To think I'll meet you here again.

832
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,810
Coincidence...

833
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,990
is not that simple.

834
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,670
While I was in Gyeongseong,

835
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,779
I couldn't stop

836
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,749
thinking about you, Comrade Geum Soon.

837
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,519
If I let time pass like this,

838
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,920
I thought...

839
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,510
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

840
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,950
And that's why...

841
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,109
I, Rhee Jong Moon,

842
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,749
will find you, Comrade Geum Soon,

843
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,990
no matter where you are.

844
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,020
I am...

845
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,820
planning not to return to Gyeongseong.

846
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,780
Comrade Geum Soon.

847
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,550
From now on,

848
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,880
would it be all right

849
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,180
if I stay by your side

850
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,690
forever?

851
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:20,289
♫ Stand by your side ♫

852
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:27,509
♫ I'm right here ♫

853
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:31,739
♫ Stand by your side ♫

854
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:37,869
♫ Always ♫

855
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:45,870
♫ Even when I walk in pitch
darkness, you become my light ♫

856
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,449
(Curtain Call)

857
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,329
My name is Yoo Jae Heon.

858
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,219
Did you come carrying piles of cash?

859
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,019
As soon as we finish the legal review,

860
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,329
I'll let you know right away.

861
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,939
In order to protect the hotel,

862
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,639
Se Yeon...

863
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,909
went along with the performance.

864
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,979
Hey. Don't you dare
talk about it like that.

865
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,559
If you're here regarding
the inheritance issue,

866
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,369
none of the family members are here, so...

867
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,960
I came to see the two of you today.

868
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,689
She always imagined here

869
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,429
you coming in on a boat over the horizon.

870
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,960
I know.

871
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,299
I want to protect everything.

872
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,379
Whether it's Grandmother, or the hotel.

873
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,709
I'm getting confused about whether
this is a bad thing or a good thing.

874
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:26,219
Yoon Hee, I think I really need to do this.

875
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:31,060
♫ My heart beats ♫
