1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,567
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

3
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,934
May I have a seat?

4
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,633
EPISODE 11

5
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,033
Well,

6
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,233
I doubt you're asking
because you feel sorry

7
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,867
for this old lady who appears to be
staring into space all alone.

8
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:43,734
No.

9
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,967
I was supposed to meet a comrade here,

10
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,500
but I can't get in touch with him.

11
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,834
I was getting frustrated.

12
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,633
Huh?

13
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,333
Your accent…

14
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,300
Where are you from?

15
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,066
I come from the North.

16
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,367
Oh, my.

17
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,467
My goodness. How delightful.

18
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,000
Delighted to meet you. I too…

19
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:17,700
I too come from up North.

20
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,266
Is that right?

21
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,033
My father told me

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,767
to visit these shores
if I were to ever go to the South.

23
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:39,700
My comrade didn't show up,

24
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,934
so I had some time to look around,

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
and I saw you sitting by the windows.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,767
The look in your eyes,

27
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,567
it reminded me of home.

28
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,800
So I brazenly asked to sit with you.

29
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,367
Oh, no. It's fine.

30
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,066
Oh, my.

31
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:10,066
Seeing someone from home out here

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,533
is surprising but delightful.

33
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,767
Take no heed and have a cup of tea.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,567
Se-yeon. Are you an idiot?

35
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,433
All you had to do was just say no.

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,667
Why were you just sitting there,
letting him bully you?

37
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,133
What gives you the right?

38
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,133
-What?
-Because you're family?

39
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,400
Is that why?

40
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,934
What gives you the right
to tell me what to do?

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,467
Se-yeon.

42
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,734
Did you ask me what gives me the right?

43
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,467
I mean, what are we? Strangers?

44
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,700
Yes, that's right.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,500
We're just strangers.

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,200
-Se-yeon.
-Isn't that right, Jae-heon?

47
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,100
I remember…

48
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,066
when I took refuge here.

49
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:45,867
After I was separated from my family,
I came down here alone.

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,033
In the decades since then…

51
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,467
I've been gazing at those shores,

52
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,834
waiting for them.

53
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,100
And did you meet your family?

54
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,834
Oh, well.

55
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,266
Not too long ago…

56
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,500
my grandson came looking for me,

57
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,266
whom I thought would be in the North.

58
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:23,133
He's right around your age.

59
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,700
If you unexpectedly live for so long,

60
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,900
you unexpectedly

61
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,533
have to part with many.

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,133
You have to part with your own children,

63
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,800
who were the apples of your eye.

64
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,400
After seeing each of them go,

65
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,633
I've been…

66
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,600
living with regrets…

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,934
for quite some time.

68
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,800
The child

69
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,500
I never expected to see before I died

70
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,700
came to me.

71
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,734
Despite his tough upbringing,

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,834
he's grown into a proper young man.

73
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,900
I was so glad

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,533
to see that his heart
is so pure and upright.

75
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,667
Wherever he wishes to go from here,

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,433
he will choose the right path.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,133
I have faith in that now.

78
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,333
I…

79
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,934
I found some relief…

80
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,533
when I realized that about him.

81
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,200
Must've felt great.

82
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,266
Yes, indeed.

83
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,867
It felt great and so much more.

84
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,066
I was happy.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,834
Here, in the last moments of my life,

86
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,133
it felt somewhat like a parting gift

87
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,400
from a god of destiny.

88
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,767
That's what I believe.

89
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,367
Oh, dear.

90
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,200
I've been blabbing about myself too much.

91
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,166
Haven't I?

92
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,767
Now, then, young man,

93
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,433
do you have family in the South?

94
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,166
Do you?

95
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,900
That's what I heard from my father.

96
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,033
Then your family here--

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,500
Have you met them?

98
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Well, that's…

99
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,333
The situation is a little different.

100
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,433
Different?

101
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,467
My father,

102
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,734
he longed for his mother
who'd left for the South.

103
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,567
Then he started blaming her.

104
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:05,533
If you live in hardship,
you either rely on others or blame others.

105
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,333
It's one or the other.

106
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,467
He did exactly that.

107
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,533
He relied on his mother, who wasn't there.

108
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,734
Then he started blaming her.

109
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,200
I understand.

110
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,967
I've taken too much of your time.

111
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,233
Oh, no. Not at all.

112
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,633
Right. Weren't you waiting for someone?

113
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,900
Don't mind me. Stay as long as you wish.

114
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,100
Right, then.

115
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,333
He's probably not coming,

116
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,166
if he's this late.

117
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,033
Thank you for the tea.

118
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:59,233
Be well until we meet again.

119
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,367
Can't you just come with us?

120
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,300
Moon-seong,

121
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,033
let's promise to meet here again
next year, okay?

122
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,633
Let's make a promise, like this.

123
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,133
Grandma, we'll meet again.

124
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,834
My name is Ri Moon-seong. Don't forget me.

125
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,333
Right. So…

126
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,100
I…

127
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,533
What did you just say?

128
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,300
Are you still going to keep this up?

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,333
I honestly have

130
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,967
no idea what you're talking about.

131
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,500
-Yoo Jae-heon.
-Who's that?

132
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,433
Theater actor Yoo Jae-heon.

133
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,433
For how long

134
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,266
have you known?

135
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,266
How did you know?

136
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,033
Is that important?

137
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,433
I…

138
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,133
Can you hear me out this once? I…

139
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,300
-I can explain everything.
-What can you explain?

140
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,433
Why you did this?

141
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Why you've been acting?

142
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,066
Why you had to become Ri Moon-seong?

143
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,066
I know.

144
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Yeah.

145
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,700
I think I understand.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,066
That's why I kept quiet.

147
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,667
That reporter came asking about you,
my younger cousin.

148
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:34,100
No, he came asking about you,
who is pretending to be him.

149
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,333
What would happen if you're exposed?

150
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,967
When your face gets printed
in the newspapers

151
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,066
as Nakwon Group's third grandson,

152
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,834
what do you think will happen to you?

153
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,233
That's why…

154
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,033
That's why I…

155
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,333
I did everything for you.

156
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,934
Do I look stupid to you?

157
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,667
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,066
Let me ask you one thing.

159
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,367
You've been good to me.

160
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,133
Was all of that…

161
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,734
Were you just acting because you had to?

162
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,800
All the wonderful times we spent together,

163
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,033
the memories we made--

164
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,467
Was that all an act?

165
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,667
No.

166
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,066
It was real.

167
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,600
As Ri Moon-seong…

168
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,100
and as the actor Yoo Jae-heon…

169
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,400
it wasn't an act.

170
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,200
My father--

171
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,567
He longed for his mother,
who'd left for the South.

172
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,633
Then he started blaming her.

173
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,600
Grandma.

174
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,633
You should've told me you were coming.

175
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:39,166
I wanted to see the hotel.

176
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,633
I missed you too.

177
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
It was that kind of day, you know?

178
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,734
I was at a place nearby…

179
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,100
so I thought I'd visit.

180
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,300
What was the occasion?

181
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,567
Moon-seong, that child,

182
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,734
he told me to come

183
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,200
once in a while

184
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,200
and keep a close eye from afar.

185
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:08,834
On what?

186
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,266
-Se-yeon.
-Yes?

187
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:15,934
If…

188
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,200
Moon-seong wasn't the person…

189
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,533
we thought he was,

190
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,133
what would you do?

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,433
That would be awful.

192
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,867
Everyone was worried at first.

193
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,133
We're all terrified of the unknown,
after all.

194
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:45,967
But now, you, Se-gyu, Ms. Yoon,

195
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:49,033
Ji-won, and everyone else loves him.

196
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:53,266
Se-jun can't be helped.
He's always been like that.

197
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,233
And you?

198
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,467
What do you think?

199
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,533
Do you like him?

200
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,734
Yes. I like him.

201
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,467
When I first met that child…

202
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:32,066
I was so surprised.

203
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,700
He couldn't look more like your grandpa.

204
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,400
Moon-seong?

205
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,834
Isn't that fascinating?

206
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,633
Yeah.

207
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,467
Moon-seong's grandpa…

208
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,266
So, your first love?

209
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,900
Yes, my first love.

210
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,433
Do they really look alike?

211
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,367
They don't just look alike.

212
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:14,500
The child is the spitting image
of his grandfather.

213
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:18,400
I thought he'd come back from the dead.

214
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,700
Is that even possible?

215
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,433
Like grandfather, like grandson.

216
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,767
There's nothing strange about that.

217
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,633
Right.

218
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,633
Like grandfather, like grandson.

219
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,567
I guess that shouldn't be strange.

220
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:20,900
And did you meet your family?

221
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,467
Ah, well. Not too long ago…

222
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:32,567
my grandson came looking for me,
whom I thought would be in the North.

223
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:37,133
He's right around your age.

224
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:15,934
What's wrong?

225
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,567
Jae-heon called an emergency meeting.

226
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,166
Why?

227
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,633
-He says he'll say when he's here.
-Really?

228
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,100
-Jae-heon.
-Hey.

229
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,266
Mr. Jeong, there you are.

230
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,100
What's this about?

231
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,066
-Well, it's…
-What's up?

232
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,734
You're looking good.

233
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,033
What is it?

234
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,400
The thing is…

235
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,066
Mr. Jeong, you must visit this room often.

236
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,567
You three seem really close.

237
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:55,500
Maybe you got close
while traveling down from the North.

238
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,467
I suppose so.

239
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,367
Yes, of course.

240
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,633
If it weren't for him, Moon-seong and I,

241
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,700
we would've suffered in China
without being able to meet Grandma.

242
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,800
Comrade Sang-cheol,

243
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,800
he's family to us, isn't that right?

244
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,266
Thank you for thinking that way.

245
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,367
Of course.

246
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:19,934
Mr. Jeong, I'm hurt.

247
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:24,934
You've known me since birth,
and you were never this friendly to me.

248
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
You're different from them…

249
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:28,633
Was I being friendly?

250
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,133
No one's on my side.

251
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
Se-yeon, it's all a misunderstanding.

252
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,800
Those whom your grandmother missed
had finally arrived.

253
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,400
-I needed to help them adjust--
-Mr. Jeong.

254
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,700
What?

255
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,500
Stop it.

256
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,433
You can stop now, Mr. Jeong.

257
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,433
Wow.

258
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,600
Your Seoul accent improved a lot.

259
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,266
He's improving much faster than I,
since he's been working at the hotel.

260
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,100
No, really. Stop it.

261
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,100
Se-- I mean--

262
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,433
Se--

263
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,900
Moon-seong, what's wrong with you?

264
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,533
Se-yeon… knows everything.

265
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,633
Cover's blown. She knows everything.

266
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,100
Seo Yoon-hee.

267
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,667
Shall we meet officially?

268
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes.

269
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,567
I'm Seo Yoon-hee.

270
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,166
Hello.

271
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:54,433
I wish we hadn't met
under such circumstances.

272
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,767
All we did was follow
Mr. Jeong Sang-cheol's orders,

273
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,900
so we ask that you understand
and be gracious to us.

274
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Fine.

275
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,033
Sorry.

276
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,700
-Se-yeon, let me begin--
-Mr. Jeong.

277
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,567
Let's talk details tomorrow.

278
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,834
I'll choose the place.

279
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,433
We'll resume talking at that place.

280
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,233
What does that mean?

281
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,066
If I keep coming here,
people are going to get suspicious.

282
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Se-jun and Grandma will think it strange.

283
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,400
-So…
-Yes?

284
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:57,734
So…

285
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,800
what happens to us?

286
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,333
You're not going to blab?

287
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,567
"Blab"? Where are your manners?

288
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:16,433
From now on,
we don't speak of this in the house, okay?

289
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:25,934
You will always speak to me in the house
as Ri Moon-seong and Jang Jin-suk.

291
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,800
No problem. No problem at all. Yes.

292
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:33,567
-We just do what we've been doing.
-That's right.

293
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,867
Indeed.

294
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,567
Many years ago, when I was a child,

295
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,934
I stole Se-gyu's bike

296
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,800
and completely broke it.

297
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,767
Do you remember?

298
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,734
I hid, thinking I'd be in trouble.

299
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,433
That's when you told me,

300
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:18,667
"Whatever the circumstance,
honesty is the best policy."

301
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,166
So I told my parents the truth
and got in so much trouble.

302
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,767
But you were right.

303
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:31,533
I learned that it's better
to tell the truth

304
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,600
and get into trouble than to run and hide.

305
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,166
Even now…

306
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,367
I think you're right.

307
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,333
All I wanted was for the chairwoman

308
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,667
to fill her final memories…

309
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,667
with happiness.

310
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,066
I know.

311
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,333
That's why,

312
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,066
just this once,

313
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm letting myself do something
I think is wrong.

314
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,800
Wow. She took him outside.

315
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:21,867
What?

316
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,100
I knew it.

317
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,700
Idiot. How did you get caught?

318
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,734
I know a woman who's friends with Se-yeon.

319
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:40,767
They say the devil is in the details.
Troubles occur where we least expect.

320
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,767
But I don't think Se-yeon
is going to reveal our identity yet.

321
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,900
It's a relief, though, right?

322
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,967
Sorry.

323
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:56,567
Damn it.

324
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,000
It's fine. I'm sure it'll work out.

325
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:04,333
You can't control every single
connection of yours, I guess.

326
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,600
You're right. Thanks.

327
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:14,166
I also know one of Se-jun's acquaintances.

328
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:16,967
What?

329
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,166
What'd you say? Who?

330
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,734
My mom.

331
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,166
Your mom?

332
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,934
I always knew it was a small world,
but now I really feel it.

333
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:33,934
Darn it.

334
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
You ready?

335
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,266
Let's go.

336
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,133
Going somewhere?

337
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:07,033
Chairwoman. Good day.

338
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Grandma, there you are.

339
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,567
Did you sleep well?

340
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,133
Yes.

341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,934
Are you going somewhere?

342
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:28,600
We're going to town with Mr. Jeong.

343
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,266
I haven't been out with him recently.
That's why.

344
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,433
Yes, of course.

345
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,767
You can go anywhere in South Korea.

346
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,667
Have a good time.

347
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:44,800
Yes, Grandma.

348
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
We'll be seeing you, Chairwoman.

349
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:54,467
Let's go.

350
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,633
So I hired these two

351
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,333
to perform this play for the chairwoman.

352
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:19,734
So Ri Moon-seong… isn't just fiction.

353
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,633
That's right.

354
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,700
But Jae-heon's Ri Moon-seong

355
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:28,867
and the real Ri Moon-seong

356
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,066
are completely different.

357
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,834
The real Moon-seong is much rougher,

358
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,900
and despite finding him,

359
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,767
I couldn't bring him to the chairwoman.

360
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,934
Where is this real Ri Moon-seong?

361
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, you see…

362
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,433
What is it?

363
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,133
Actually,

364
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,667
he's in South Korea.

365
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:00,800
What?

366
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,633
How?

367
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,400
I hired someone to find me
the real Moon-seong,

368
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,600
but he's now partnered up with Se-jun.

369
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,133
That's why he brought
the real Ri Moon-seong from China.

370
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So, Se-jun knows about everything too?

371
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, it certainly seems that way.

372
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,667
Why would he pretend not to know?

373
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,433
I mean, think about it.

374
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:42,700
If it were me, I would bring the real one
before the entire family to say,

375
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:46,166
"This is the real Moon-seong.
He's an impostor.

376
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:49,300
Let's check who's telling the truth.
How's that?"

377
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,100
It's making me more anxious
that he's quiet about it.

378
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,433
It makes sense,
considering his personality.

379
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:59,300
A reporter came to see me a while ago.

380
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,834
He wanted to speak…

381
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,033
to Moon-seong, meaning Jae-heon.

382
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,834
It was probably Se-jun's move.

383
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,834
He wanted to reveal Jae-heon's identity,

384
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,200
then bring out the real Moon-seong.

385
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,333
It all makes sense.

386
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,133
I think he means to lessen the shock
Grandma might have to deal with.

387
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:27,500
How much does Se-jun know?

388
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,567
He knows the real Moon-seong is here.

389
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,467
I don't think he knows that we know.

390
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,567
This is getting really complicated.

391
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,200
Let's act like we don't know anything.

392
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,066
What?

393
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,567
As long as we're in this situation,
we can't let Grandma know the whole truth.

394
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:58,667
Since the play has started,
let's finish it with a happy ending.

395
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:04,066
You two, keep up the act
as Grandma's grandson and his wife.

396
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,467
Mr. Jeong,
can you find out where Moon-seong is?

397
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,934
I don't know where he's disappeared to.

398
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:15,367
But I can still handle the man I hired.

399
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,567
I'll let you know if he gives me anything.

400
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:22,567
I'll keep acting like I don't know
and try to figure out

401
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,934
what Se-jun is planning.

402
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,967
So, the man who knows is acting
like he doesn't know

403
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:32,266
and those who know he knows
will act like they don't know he knows.

404
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,133
That's the game.

405
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,033
I guess I've joined the stage.

406
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,533
The play you've built--

407
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:48,533
I'll make sure he doesn't ruin it.

408
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,633
I'm going to protect everything.

409
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,700
Grandma's memories…

410
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,967
and our hotel.

411
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,133
Good.

412
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,900
Damn it.

413
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:15,967
Yes, sir.

414
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:17,967
Found Ri Moon-seong?

415
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,700
I can't figure out where he is.
I can't reach him either.

416
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:23,533
Tae-ju.

417
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:27,533
I'll let you know as soon as I find him.

418
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,133
What about Se-jun?

419
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,166
He hasn't contacted me yet.

420
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,867
Ri Moon-seong and Park Se-jun--

421
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:37,033
maybe they're in contact somehow?

422
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,967
If Se-jun calls you, stall him
by pretending you're with Ri Moon-seong.

423
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,867
And let me know immediately, okay?

424
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:44,166
Yes, sir.

425
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,600
Also, Tae-ju,

426
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
let's find him fast.

427
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,133
Yes, sir.

428
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,200
Damn it.

429
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,800
These are so good.

430
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,133
Do you like paintings?

431
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,367
I like looking at them.

432
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,900
I went to the Met whenever I was bored.

433
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:24,000
I went to eat in SoHo if I got hungry.

434
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,667
You lived in New York?

435
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:30,467
No, but I did live on the East Coast.

436
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,433
I went there during school breaks.

437
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,433
What is she?

438
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,767
Yeah, I'd like to find out.

439
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:46,400
Yo, Yoon-hee, who are you?

440
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,734
Seo Yoon-hee,
a member of the Friendship Theater Group,

441
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,900
playing the role of Jang Jin-suk.

442
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,066
Who is this handsome gentleman?

443
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,767
He's very handsome.

444
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,567
Who is this?

445
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:22,734
It's Mr. Jeong when he was younger.

446
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,667
-What?
-What?

447
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,567
This is Mr. Jeong?

448
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,467
Yeah.

449
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,734
Wow. No way.

450
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,900
He could be taken for a K-pop star.

451
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,633
Aging really did a number on him.

452
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,567
No, no. This isn't just an aging issue.

453
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,500
Time took him by the shins
and shook the life out of him.

454
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:46,367
Life must have given him a TKO.

455
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
-What happened?
-Talking about me?

456
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:57,233
You still have this picture?

457
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,667
It's hotel history. Of course I kept it.

458
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,567
If I think about it,

459
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,100
it's a peculiar relationship.

460
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:14,133
Nakwon Hotel… and I.

461
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,700
Mr. Jeong,
this is no time to get lost in memories.

462
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,367
Can you explain this picture?
Is this really you?

463
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,000
It is me.

464
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:26,800
Everyone is young at some point.
Filled with vigor and passion.

465
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,633
Feeling like you can do anything.

466
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,500
I was like that once.

467
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:37,100
1990, NAKWON HOTEL

468
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,133
Shall we kick him out?

469
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,700
-Hey, miss.
-Yes?

470
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,734
-Get me a cup of coffee.
-Yes, sir.

471
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:55,033
-Have they been harassing everyone?
-No.

472
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,967
Then they're our guests.

473
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:02,767
Not showing bias toward any guest--
that's our policy here at Nakwon.

474
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:06,333
Don't favor one guest over another.

475
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,133
A guest is a guest. Don't forget that.

476
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,367
Yes, Ms. Ja.

477
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,633
Hey!

478
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,433
What do you think you're doing?

479
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,266
Get out of my hotel this instant!

480
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,300
How dare you go berserk in here!

481
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,433
If you come as a guest,
you'll be treated like one.

482
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,433
But causing harm towards others
at my hotel,

483
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,066
that is unacceptable!

484
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,600
Get out!

485
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,867
Sir! Sir!

486
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:05,467
-The pigs are here! The pigs!
-Damn it.

487
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,100
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

488
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:14,800
Put that knife down.

489
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,300
I said, put it down!

490
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,934
Out of my way!

491
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm not letting you murder someone
in my hotel!

492
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,500
Don't move. Your wounds will open back up.

493
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,734
So you survived?

494
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,066
Come to your senses?

495
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,867
Why didn't you let me kill him?

496
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:31,033
Let me ask you something too.

497
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,767
If you kill that man,
do you get a medal for doing so?

498
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,333
You know what else?

499
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,500
Those thugs were all captured.
They'll be in the slammer.

500
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,266
I'm sure they'll be out in a few months.
But what about you?

501
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,500
What's next for you if you go there?

502
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:53,166
You may have gotten a life sentence.

503
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:08,233
So now you're indebted to me for life.

504
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:15,667
I won't let you go
until you have paid your debt.

505
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,834
You will work for me.

506
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:20,834
Some proper work.

507
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:29,667
She's some loony.

508
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,900
Don't talk about her like that.

509
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,166
It suits you.

510
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,400
-Yes, ma'am.
-Take a seat.

511
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,200
This is your salary.

512
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,367
TO: MR. JUNG SANG-CHEOL

513
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:46,133
You made proper money
by doing proper work.

514
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:48,133
How does that feel?

515
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,533
-Thank you.
-You've done well.

516
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,533
Let's work harder now, Mr. Jeong.

517
00:43:58,667 --> 00:43:59,867
Ma'am?

518
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:04,200
Ms. Ja, they're ready for you.

519
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,533
Oh, okay.

520
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Let's go.

521
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,133
EARNINGS STATEMENT
OCTOBER 1990

522
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,066
Ms. Ja is here now.

523
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:28,533
Hello, Ms. Ja.

524
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,433
Wow. You all look spiffy.

525
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:34,967
Mr. Jeong, come over here.

526
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,066
Get over here.

527
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,400
Okay, good. Okay, let's take it.

528
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,200
Okay, here we go.

529
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,200
One, two, three!

530
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:52,100
She saved my life,

531
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,533
and then she gave me a new life.

532
00:44:56,867 --> 00:45:01,100
That's the kind of person she is to me.

533
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,000
So, is this…

534
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,767
Ms. Yoon, the housemaid?

535
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,700
That's right.
She used to be the hotel manager.

536
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,734
When Grandma stopped working on the floor,

537
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,667
she also retired
and began working at our house.

538
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:29,867
She was beautiful, huh?

539
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:33,367
What do you mean, "was"?
She's still beautiful.

540
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:36,867
Can't you tell in one look?
She was prettier back then.

541
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:42,633
Hey, that's not what you said about me.

542
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,800
I can accept that that's Ms. Yoon,
but the guy next to her…

543
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:49,033
You can't accept that that's me?

544
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,367
-Well, what I mean is…
-You little…

545
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:53,567
How dare you?

546
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,834
No, I'm saying you look
a little different.

547
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,834
Just a little different.
That's all I'm saying.

548
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,934
Why do you sleep down here
when you have your own bed?

549
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,567
This sofa is more comfortable,

550
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,000
and it happens to be here.

551
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:32,266
You like it?

552
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,433
I like it.

553
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:40,166
This old sofa is still good, isn't it?

554
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:43,066
It's so comfy. It's perfect.

555
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,700
I love it as much as you.

556
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,934
Hey, after I die,

557
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,467
take this sofa for yourself.

558
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,734
Then write that in your will.

559
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,100
Silly boy. You're always trying
to get one up on me.

560
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,133
You started it.

561
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,333
It should be good until you get married.

562
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,266
Are you saying
I should use this sofa until I die?

563
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:12,133
What now?

564
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:15,667
Miss Ja Geum-sun.

565
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:20,000
Please stop talking about death so easily.

566
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,800
I can, but you can't.

567
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:28,233
Fine, you silly. Fine.

568
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,433
Fine.

569
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:32,433
Promise me.

570
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,600
Okay? Promise.

571
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:40,633
Why are you in such a good mood?

572
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,300
Oh, my boy.

573
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,467
Se-gyu.

574
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,000
Grandma loves you.

575
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,066
Are you going someplace nice?

576
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:17,166
Yeah. It's been a while since we went out.

577
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:18,533
Is that so?

578
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,467
What about you?

579
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,333
Did you all go somewhere?

580
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,667
Yeah. It's been a while, so Moon-seong
and Jin-suk, Mr. Jeong and I

581
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,300
all ate out together.

582
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,600
-Really?
-Yeah.

583
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,000
Who else will take care of our cousin
if I don't?

584
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:36,233
You're so busy with work.

585
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,967
Se-gyu basically doesn't care.

586
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
So it falls on me.

587
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,133
You should take care of him too,
and not just your wife.

588
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,967
-Come on, Se-yeon.
-You'd be okay with that, right?

589
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,233
No. Don't mind me.

590
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,166
She's right, honey.

591
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:56,800
Next time, let's all eat out with them.

592
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:58,467
All right.

593
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:01,433
Moon-seong.

594
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,033
I haven't checked up on you.
I've been so busy.

595
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,066
Let's eat out together soon. You too.

596
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Okay.

597
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,200
We'd love that.

598
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,800
-But it's still a relief.
-Huh? What do you mean?

599
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,066
At least you're taking care of him.

600
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:20,567
Of course. We're family.

601
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,734
That's what families do.

602
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,867
Yeah. We are family.

603
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,066
-Yeah.
-We'll get going.

604
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,133
Okay.

605
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,700
-Have a good time.
-See you.

606
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,367
See you, Jin-suk.

607
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:47,867
Why are you looking at me like that?

608
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,467
Se-yeon, you're quite the actress.

609
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:56,467
You were so thick-skinned.
It was so smooth and natural.

610
00:49:56,533 --> 00:49:58,533
Don't say she's thick-skinned.

611
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:01,467
Had I known you were so good at acting,

612
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,734
I would have consulted you
from the beginning.

613
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,033
Come on, Mr. Jeong.

614
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,467
Come on, sir.

615
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,433
Do you guys need something?

616
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,467
No. We're fine.

617
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,800
We're just here to get some coffee.

618
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:39,667
Let me make you some.

619
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:42,266
No, no. It's okay.

620
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,567
We'll make it.

621
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,300
It's no problem for me either.

622
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,467
Sit while you wait.

623
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,867
Is it okay for you two?

624
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:03,767
Drinking coffee so late?
You might have trouble sleeping.

625
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,333
That's true.

626
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,433
We just have a lot to talk about.

627
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,266
-We think it'll be a long night.
-Right.

628
00:51:16,066 --> 00:51:18,000
Sure. That happens.

629
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,367
Those times when you don't want
the night to pass.

630
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:24,767
Yes.

631
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,333
Oh, this is so good.

632
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Right?

633
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:33,300
So,

634
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,934
are you trying to make a baby?

635
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,767
My goodness.

636
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:44,967
Se-jun doesn't seem to want a child.

637
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:48,633
Se-gyu and Se-yeon are still unmarried.

638
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,367
I always wondered when the family
would see children.

639
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:56,500
Maybe you two will bring bundles of joy.

640
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:02,266
Well, Ms. Yoon.

641
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,066
It's just that, that's not what we meant.

642
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,333
Oh, silly me.
I'm taking too much of your time.

643
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,934
Oh, no. You're fine.

644
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'll get going.

645
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:14,433
No, Ms. Yoon.

646
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,567
-Oh, no.
-No, Ms. Yoon. It's not like that.

647
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:22,300
-No, really.
-Ms. Yoon.

648
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:26,200
Well, she made things a bit awkward.

649
00:52:29,734 --> 00:52:30,967
What?

650
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:32,033
What?

651
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,033
Hello?

652
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,066
Hey, it's me.

653
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:55,333
Who?

654
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,667
It's Jang Jin-suk.

655
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
What's going on?

656
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:05,934
I sent you an email. Could you check it?

ANALYSIS OF HOTEL NAKWON
STOCK PRICES

659
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,400
Hello.

660
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,400
Hello, Se-yeon.

661
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,300
What was that? What you sent me?

662
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,200
It's what you think.

663
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:16,867
How did you know?

664
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:20,767
Someone from a specific section
is purchasing shares regularly.

665
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,433
I don't think the person intends
to raise the stock price.

666
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,200
Who else would it be? It's Se-jun.

667
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,467
He's increasing his shares
with micro-purchases.

668
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,967
Did you figure that out
just by reading the charts?

669
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:38,367
It's the charts

670
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:40,900
and some psychology.

671
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,734
I know an attorney working for Se-jun
pretty well.

672
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:49,066
That person would do something like this.

673
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,100
She's a perfectionist.

674
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:55,834
She would choose 100% over 51%.

675
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:00,734
How do you know her?

676
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:03,867
She's my mom.

677
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,567
What?

678
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:10,467
Now that I think about it,
we're family against family.

679
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,433
You're against Se-jun. I'm against my mom.

680
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:15,767
This is fascinating.

681
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:22,133
You should still keep your hotel.

682
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,500
I will.

683
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,967
What's it to you, though?

684
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:33,033
I just…

685
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,533
wanted to help.

686
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,600
So, what should we do?

687
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:45,500
Ironically, the best method for you
is to raise the stock price.

688
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:49,600
No matter how rich you are,
you will have limits.

689
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:54,533
Once the price goes up,
the purchasing will also slow down.

690
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,433
Any favorable news at the hotel?

691
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,800
When did you set this up?

692
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:06,533
Well,

693
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:10,166
when Se-jun met with Bilton,
I caught on quickly.

694
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:12,967
So I made a company,

695
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:16,033
chose the board, and bought the shares.

696
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,967
The minimal requirement
for me to get my voting power.

697
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:24,834
So, do you need my shares?

698
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:30,667
I do.

699
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,800
For how much?

700
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:35,934
Name a price.

701
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,700
I will buy it at any price you want.

702
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,700
I have plenty of money.

703
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,133
I only want one thing.

704
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,934
You know what it is.

705
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:44,066
Grandma.

706
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,834
There you are.

707
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,266
Oh, child…

708
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:50,533
Grandma.

709
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,266
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

710
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:55,600
No, I…

711
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:57,734
I'm feeling fine.

712
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,734
How did you know I was here?

713
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,600
I'll take your word for it, then.

714
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,233
I had a feeling you'd be here,
so I came looking.

715
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,667
Goodness.

716
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:17,600
Are you slacking off
during your work hours?

717
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,533
Oh, Grandma.

718
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,433
Hotels don't work our socks off.

719
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,467
They give us lunch breaks and all.

720
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,300
This is my lunch break.

721
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:28,834
Are you allowed to be here?

722
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,934
Come on, Grandma.

723
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:35,100
Aren't you the queen of this hotel?

724
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,667
Nobody would dare say anything.

725
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,400
Grandma, I'm not slacking off.

726
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:47,567
Consider this as time for your welfare

727
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,100
and stay right where you are.

728
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:03,700
Grandma, does this feel relaxing?

729
00:59:04,266 --> 00:59:06,734
Indeed, it does feel relaxing.

730
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,867
Wow, Grandma. Your shoulders are so tight.

731
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,667
I had a fair taste of bitterness in life.
That's why.

732
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:22,667
They have been neglected for so long.

733
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:24,266
That's why.

734
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,467
Grandma, I'll make them all go away.

735
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:24,667
CURTAIN CALL

736
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:25,967
Did you see this?

737
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:29,133
What's up?

738
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,767
But you built some
shiny fortress for yourself, huh?

739
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:37,400
I thought I was waiting for you.

740
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,233
But I was wrong.

741
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,233
Keep going, Comrade Ri Moon-seong.

742
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,834
What are you trying to do?

743
01:00:46,233 --> 01:00:48,834
-Are you really going to?
-It's a done deal.

744
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,367
I have feelings for you.
