1
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,166
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,533
Yeong-hoon!

3
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,567
Yeong-hoon! Yeong-hoon!

4
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,066
Father!

5
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,967
Father!

6
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,300
Father!

7
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,200
What was that?

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Grandma.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Grandma.

10
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,567
Grandma.

11
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,700
Grandma.

12
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,834
Stop yelling my name.

13
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,767
My ears might just fall off.

14
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:13,834
Grandma.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,533
Oh, my goodness. Let me go.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,667
I can't breathe because of you.

17
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,767
At this rate,
I might die quicker than usual.

18
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,433
Stop fussing. I came out for a stroll
because I simply couldn't sleep.

19
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,233
-Grandma, I…
-What?

20
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,033
I just had a dream.

21
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Did I die in your dream?

22
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,734
Grandma.

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Sooner or later,
you might just wet your bed.

24
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,333
Grandma, come on.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,667
I think you were 12 back then.

26
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,600
I secretly washed your blanket for you.
Remember?

27
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,934
Why do you keep bringing that up?

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,266
Se-yeon, a dream is a dream.

29
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,800
Who stands before you now?

30
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,567
Who is speaking to you right now?

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,934
My grandma.

32
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,900
So stop worrying, and let's go back in.

33
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,033
You just had a nightmare.

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
-So, you're okay?
-Of course.

35
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,567
EPISODE 5

36
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,300
Grandma, we're back.

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,567
Is she in her room?

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,233
Se-jun.

39
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,233
We're back from our trip.

40
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,200
Where are you going?

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,467
I have an appointment to meet someone.

42
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,500
I see.

43
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:49,266
I heard you went on a trip.
Did you get to see a lot of South Korea?

44
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,233
-We saw a lot of flower fields.
-That's right.

45
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,600
That's good.

46
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,934
My wife seemed to miss you.
She kept asking for you.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,133
-Oh, really?
-You must be tired. Get some rest.

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Still, we should say hello to Grandma,
since we've had so much fun.

49
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,867
-She's in her room. You'll find her there.
-Okay.

50
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,533
See you later.

51
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,734
Something's changed.

52
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,000
Grandma.

53
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Who is it?

54
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,934
-Moon-seong, you're back.
-Grandma.

55
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,934
Welcome back home.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,200
-Grandma, take a seat.
-Okay.

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,333
Grandma, we brought you some gifts.

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,734
-Oh, you didn't have to.
-Here we go.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,333
I have everything.
I don't need these things.

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,533
Grandma.

61
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,900
You don't have this.

62
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,433
LIFE BEGINS AT 90

63
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,333
Oh, my.

64
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,300
You both look adorable.

65
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,967
-Isn't it great?
-Yes.

66
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,734
I did the writing.

67
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,734
Grandma, shall we take a picture?

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,033
Sure.

69
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,033
Come here.

70
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay. One, two, three.

71
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,967
How did you get all this information?

72
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,633
Mutually beneficial relationships
are always good to have.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,667
Thank you, Miss Hong.

74
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,967
Did she attend beauty pageants?
What a unique bow.

75
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,266
Hey, hurry up.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,133
Here's the data
on the chairwoman's relatives.

77
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,233
All right.

78
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,066
Good day.

79
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,066
-Did you find anything?
-Yes. Here you go.

80
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:24,033
RI MOON-SEONG'S
PERSONAL INFORMATION

81
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,467
JANG JIN-SUK'S
PERSONAL INFORMATION

82
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,200
You sure about this information?

83
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,767
We confirmed what we could
among our resources.

84
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,967
It's unlikely that Se-yeon
would work with Bae Dong-jae.

85
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,667
But that doesn't mean
Dong-jae will take my side.

86
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:47,900
-However--
-You're right.

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,900
If the chairwoman

88
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,100
decides to give a portion
of the inheritance to Ri Moon-seong,

89
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,300
and Se-yeon joins forces with him,
then she'll take the win.

90
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,900
RI MOON-SEONG -
PERSONAL INFORMATION

91
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,200
So, after Grandma passes,

92
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,934
I'll return to my old life.

93
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,266
So as long as I'm here,

94
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,967
you can make use of me however you want.

95
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,033
Wow. What is all that?

96
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,667
Grandma told me to get
anything I wanted to eat,

97
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,600
and she gave me a magic card.

98
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,033
She did?

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,834
-What did you buy so much of?
-You'll find out when we get home.

100
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,266
I don't believe it.

101
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:03,834
How impressive.
When did you learn how to make dumplings?

102
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,333
I assumed Grandma probably forgot
the taste of her hometown,

103
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,734
so I wanted to cook for her.

104
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,066
She's going to love it.

105
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,767
You think so?

106
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,166
I should help.
Should I help with the dumplings?

107
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,266
Oh, no. Not at all.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,133
You should just sit tight and wait.

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,734
I agree.

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,734
He doesn't like it
when others help him cook.

111
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,934
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,033
I never thought I'd see this day.
All right, then.

113
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,967
He certainly isn't like the men
in our family.

114
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,734
He isn't like anybody here.

115
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,834
Is that so?

116
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,166
Yeah. Neither my dad nor my grandpa
ever even cooked instant noodles.

117
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,133
You met your wife in China, right?

118
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,500
Se-jun, you're home early today.

119
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,500
My husband understands,
but he doesn't speak very well.

120
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,567
He fell for me
before he could learn Chinese.

121
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,533
He was busy chasing me.

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
After we began dating,
I was basically his interpreter.

123
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,367
Isn't that right?

124
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,333
That's right.

125
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,000
Jin-suk, your Chinese is so fluent.

126
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:37,900
Of course.

127
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,633
I was born and raised there.

128
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,633
Wow, this is really good.

129
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,333
You mean it?

130
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,533
When I say it's good, it's good.

131
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,967
Grandma, how is it?

132
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,567
Is it to your liking?

133
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,200
It's delicious.

134
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,867
I missed this taste.

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,867
Moon-seong.

136
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, Grandma.

137
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,500
Don't you think you should start working?

138
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,000
Work?

139
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,133
Did you expect to rely on my money

140
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,166
to just sit around like a couch potato?

141
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,967
Grandma, it's not like that.

142
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,367
How about you learn a thing or two
about running hotels?

143
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,467
Sorry?

144
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,967
The hotel?

145
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,667
Grandma, I think

146
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,200
it might be better to stay by your side
and spend more time with you.

147
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,867
Do you not like to work?

148
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,066
Oh, no. That's not it.

149
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,567
Chairwoman,

150
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,800
I believe the timing isn't ideal.

151
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:26,100
He just got here, and running hotels
is all about being serviceable.

152
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,400
He doesn't have our accent down either.

153
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,533
I share blood with him,

154
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,100
and I'm the chairwoman.

155
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,633
Timing is irrelevant.

156
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,800
He is here anyway.

157
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,667
He may be unprepared,
but it's better to take root earlier on.

158
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:47,633
That's how he can grow into a strong tree.

159
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:50,767
It's so unfair.

160
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,433
You never gave me such words before.

161
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:58,767
Why are you telling him to work
but not me?

162
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,934
This applies to you too.

163
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,200
I want all of you to live well

164
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,533
and be independent even after I die.

165
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:13,033
Having said that,
I'm most worried about you,

166
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,667
since you just got here.

167
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,667
I want to see you settled
before my time is up.

168
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,934
Okay. I'll do just that.

169
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,600
Good. So we have an understanding.

170
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Let's eat.

171
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,367
You want to teach Moon-seong
how to run a hotel?

172
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,667
You don't want him to return, do you?

173
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:24,000
Of course. Why should he go back there?

174
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:27,066
He'd need a job if he were to settle here.

175
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,400
Of course.

176
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,867
If he's family,
he needs to learn how to be a hotelier.

177
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:36,166
I don't think I can just take him
under my wing.

178
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,367
You asking him to work
will meet the least resistance

179
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,433
from either Mr. Kim or my brothers.

180
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,600
Though you won't get to see him as much.

181
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,233
That's no problem.
I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

182
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,066
My granddaughter sure is thoughtful.

183
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,000
Honey,

184
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,500
should I start working again?

185
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,800
Why would you?

186
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,266
The youngest of your family
will start working soon.

187
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,367
Don't call him the youngest.

188
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,333
We don't even know his origins.

189
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,433
What's this about?

190
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Once the chairwoman passes,

191
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,834
I wonder if we might have to
take care of ourselves.

192
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,900
Including you and me.

193
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,567
Turn off the light.

194
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Se-yeon,

195
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,500
it seems like the chairwoman
is getting a bit hasty.

196
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,600
-She was doing me a favor.
-What?

197
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:02,400
Moon-seong turned down my offer,
so I asked Grandma to ask for me.

198
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:07,300
-Why?
-What do you mean?

199
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,166
You heard Grandma.

200
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,433
Se-yeon,

201
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:16,500
your getting involved in these issues
may raise the issue of fairness.

202
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,367
I know why you're worried:

203
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,400
Moon-seong failing to adjust
and being scarred for life.

204
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:24,567
Isn't that right?

205
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,667
Mr. Jeong, trust me.

206
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,333
I'll take good care of him,
so don't worry.

207
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,467
All right.

208
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,300
No. No, no…

209
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,266
What are you doing?

210
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,233
What happened?

211
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,333
Well?

212
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Think positive.

213
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,667
It might be better to stay outside
than cross paths all the time.

214
00:15:57,734 --> 00:16:01,800
What kind of a plot twist is this?
A character career change?

215
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,533
A hotelier from the North? Say that again.

216
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,700
Hotels are about hospitality management.

217
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,867
You think Ri Moon-seong could work there?

218
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:14,166
Plus, Se-yeon works there,
and her jerk of an ex-fiancé is there too.

219
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,400
That doesn't sound good.

220
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,967
He could run into dangerous people
at the hotel.

221
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,233
-Dangerous people?
-The eldest son.

222
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,433
Jae-heon, the job is what's important.

224
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,000
The job?

225
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,033
You're the unfamiliar grandchild
of the Hotel Nakwon's chairwoman.

226
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,266
Yeah.

227
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,400
That means you'll be given
a very comfortable job.

228
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,467
Like an office job.

229
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,767
Yes. That could be better.

230
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,567
No.

231
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,033
What if he starts blabbering in meetings?

232
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,967
He'll run into family members every day.
If he makes a mistake, what then?

233
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,600
Jae-heon, get a physically demanding job.
Stay outside.

234
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,834
Deal with the hotel customers instead.
You should speak as little as possible.

235
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
You're right.

236
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,300
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:10,100
But that isn't up to me.

238
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,033
That's what I'm paying you to do.

239
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

240
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,133
-He's going to work at the hotel?
-Yes.

241
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,967
We'll have him wrapped around our finger.

242
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,533
We're doing no such thing.

243
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
You never know.

244
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,333
Let's say he inherits something…

245
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,667
Damn. You're strategical.

246
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,800
Well, that's not necessarily the reason.

247
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,667
Then what is it?

248
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,834
I don't know.

249
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,700
I just want to keep him close.

250
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,300
-You're being weird.
-Am I?

251
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,066
How long have I known you?

252
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,934
I just have to look at your face

253
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,700
to know what you want to eat
and what you desire,

254
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,967
but this… is some sisterly devotion.

255
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:04,200
I didn't know you badly wanted
a little brother.

256
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,700
Oh, stop it.

257
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,533
Where will you assign him?

258
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,166
-The planning office?
-That might be best, huh?

259
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:19,900
But one thing worries me:

260
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:24,367
that leech next to Se-jun.

261
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:26,867
Mr. Kim?

262
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:30,333
I think he'll object to this
with all his might.

263
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,066
Leave it to me. I'll make it happen.

264
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:39,700
Sir, the general manager
just brought me his résumé.

265
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:40,800
PART-TIME JOB APPLICATION

266
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,834
But this looks fairly awful.

267
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:47,367
Plus, the chairwoman phoned me herself.

268
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:51,166
When you get to the office tomorrow,
study it carefully.

269
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,667
Grandma.

270
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,934
Moon-seong, are you going to work?

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,633
Yes. Today is my first day.

272
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,800
I'll do my best.

273
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,233
Since it's your first day,

274
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,967
don't work too hard.

275
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,967
I'll be back, safe and sound.

276
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,266
Grandma, are you not feeling well?

277
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,266
I'm fine.

278
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,934
It's just that… those words--

279
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,600
"I'll be back safe and sound"--

280
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
those words scare me.

281
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,567
You'll be back, won't you?

282
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Come on, Grandma.

283
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:04,066
I'll clock out on time
and come home immediately.

284
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,233
All right.

285
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,567
Have a good day.

286
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:14,900
Se-gyu, good morning.

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Hello.

288
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,767
Going somewhere?

289
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,166
I'm going to work.

290
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,767
Oh, work?

291
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,100
Let's both have a great day!

292
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,367
Se-yeon.

293
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,767
It suits you.

294
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,567
Sorry?

295
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:47,767
Hang on.

296
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,734
I'm told that I look good
when I dress to the nines.

297
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,200
You know such expressions?

298
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:07,734
I'm watching lots of TV to practice.

299
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,000
You're right.
Your accent sounds softer now.

300
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,900
Yeah, I'm trying.

301
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,367
Oh, Se-yeon. Here.

302
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:22,633
Jeong-suk told me you skipped breakfast,
so I make some fruit juice for you.

303
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,734
-Thank you.
-Drink it when you have time.

304
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,367
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

305
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,667
This is where I work.

306
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,033
I'm Hong Ra-kyung.

307
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah, hi. Nice to meet you.

308
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,200
I've heard so much about you.

309
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,967
You're handsome.

310
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,834
Oh, no. Not really.

311
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,767
You can talk to me comfortably,
like you do with Se-yeon.

312
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:22,500
I don't know about that,
but I'll certainly try.

313
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,834
Wow. You're well-spoken.

314
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,600
Oh, no. Not really.

315
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,300
Se-yeon, where should I work?

316
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
Come on.

317
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,066
Gather around, everyone.

318
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:39,000
You'll work at the planning office.

319
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,567
-You mean here?
-Yes.

320
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:47,533
But really smart people work here.

321
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,166
You'll fit right in.

322
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,900
You have the tendency to overestimate me.

323
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:58,900
This is Mr. Ri Moon-seong.
Starting today, he'll be working with us.

324
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,200
Nice to meet you. I'm Ri Moon-seong.

325
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,934
What is this during work hours?

326
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,633
Mr. Ri Moon-seong?

327
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,400
That's me. And you are?

328
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm Kim Seung-do.

329
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:35,300
He's the senior managing director.

330
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,667
Which means?

331
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,600
Someone higher
than the general manager here.

332
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,967
What's this about?

333
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,633
Moon-seong's internship issue

334
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,367
has already been approved
by Chairwoman Ja.

335
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,633
I have no problem with that.

336
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,200
But why the planning office?

337
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,166
The planning office internship's
competition rate

338
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,867
surpasses the 100-to-1 mark.

339
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:06,633
So if someone gets the internship
by way of nepotism, what of fairness?

340
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,967
Mr. Kim, our internship hiring rules
have been annulled.

341
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,867
I think you're overreacting--

342
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:18,367
The owner's family should set an example,
as they should.

343
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:22,500
I doubt the chairwoman would advocate
such hiring processes.

344
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,367
Mr. Kim.

345
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,767
I agree with every word you said.

346
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,667
Those in higher positions surely think
in superior ways.

347
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:44,000
I am truly moved.

348
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,834
So, where should I go
instead of this office?

349
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Where?

350
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,867
We've already asked porter services.

351
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,900
How can you do this to us without a word?

352
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:58,133
How dare you!

353
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,500
I can't accept such unilateral decisions.

354
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,066
This will be reported to the chairwoman.

355
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,200
Wait, Se-yeon.

356
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,567
What's a porter service?

357
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,867
You've never heard of a porter?
You carry luggage.

358
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:13,934
Mr. Kim.

359
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
A luggage carrier?

360
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,700
Jae-heon, get a physically demanding job.

361
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,667
I'm the best luggage carrier there is.

362
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,934
Carrying them to and from the Tumen River.

363
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:33,734
I think that job would be perfect for me.
I'll do just that.

364
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,233
Moon-seong.

365
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,867
Se-yeon, I think Mr. Kim is 100% correct.

366
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,500
This office job seems a little extravagant
for a newbie like me.

367
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,867
I should start from the bottom

368
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:53,500
if I want my colleagues to acknowledge me.

369
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't worry.

370
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,767
I'll do my best and work hard.

371
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,834
Mr. Kim, here's your best porter.

372
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:05,734
All right.

373
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Let's go.

374
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,734
What the hell?

375
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:17,066
Se-yeon, don't worry.

376
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,500
I'm very strong.

377
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't-- Se-yeon.

378
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,266
Are you going out for a walk?

379
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,567
No, I need to get something.

380
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,500
Are you going to the market?
Getting groceries?

381
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,500
No, not groceries.

382
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,900
Shopping. You say "shopping" in the South.

383
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:53,967
Yeah, that's right.

384
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,834
I heard you on the phone a moment ago.

385
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,800
You said you had to wear retro clothes
for a meeting.

386
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,700
How did you understand the word "retro"?

387
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,834
I pick up words here and there.

388
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,900
I think I might be of some help.

389
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,467
Can I go with you?

390
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,867
Shall we, then?

391
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,066
What's this?

392
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,667
-Wow, this is so cute.
-That's not bad.

393
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:26,300
These are so classy. Oh, my goodness.

394
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:30,500
Let's get them all. All of them.

395
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,400
This is awesome.

396
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,233
What was it per night?

397
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,900
Twenty million? Thirty?

398
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:53,100
The owner shouldn't ask that to guests.

399
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,233
I am at the bottom of the pole
of the family ownership.

400
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,600
But I couldn't book this.

401
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:04,934
You can come as you please.
I only come during the day.

402
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,066
No need.

403
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,734
I'd be really lonely
if I woke up here alone.

404
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,266
You'd sleep alone in a place like this?

405
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,934
Now you're talking nonsense.

406
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,700
Am I?

407
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
I guess I am.

408
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,600
What is it? Is something the matter?

409
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,233
ILMIRI STEAMED CHICKEN

410
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,900
-Nice to meet you.
-It looks tasty.

411
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:32,734
I'm not a good public speaker.

412
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,533
Although our first meeting has become
our farewell meeting,

413
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:43,900
don't you get the feeling
we'll run into each other anyway?

414
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,633
Let's look forward to the day
we meet again.

415
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,433
Let's get ossified!

416
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,900
-Ossified?
-What's "ossified"?

417
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:57,400
I mean, let's get drunk.
Like, "drink it all."

418
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,266
"Bottoms up."

419
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,367
Oh, it's "bottoms up" in the South?

420
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,934
To the day we meet again!

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,734
To meeting again!

422
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,300
That looks good.

423
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,633
This goes so well with drinks.

424
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:27,667
Steamed chicken here is
very spicy and juicy.

425
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,600
Do you have stuff like this in the North?

426
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:36,500
I guess you wouldn't know,
but these days in the North,

427
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,500
we have fried food, chicken dishes
and steamed chicken as well.

428
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:42,934
We have everything.

429
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,433
This is your first time meeting us,
but you seem to fit right in.

430
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,700
Thank you.

431
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
You're a little…

432
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:59,967
-A little?
-A little?

433
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:04,133
A little all right! Let's drink up.

434
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,700
Shots! Shots!

435
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:11,200
Brüderschaft, brüderschaft.
Do they have these in the North?

436
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:12,533
Wait! No.

437
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,834
The cheese topping is a work of art.

438
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,500
Look at all this cheese.

439
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:23,934
Miss Hong?

440
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:34,100
Right. So let's welcome Mr. Ri Moon-seong.

441
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,567
Cheers!

442
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,200
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

443
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,867
Let's drink up! Shots! Shots!

444
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:45,433
Let's drink up!

445
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:49,266
You, me, and my siblings.

446
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:53,934
Jerks who grow up with plenty are selfish.

447
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,900
We're rational.

448
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,800
No, no. We're selfish.

449
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,133
Se-yeon is the most decent among us.

450
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,800
She grew up too fast
because of our older brother.

451
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:10,667
But you or my brother,
the firstborn of empires--

452
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,333
You're all self-centered.

453
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,300
So what?

454
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,667
But Moon-seong…

455
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,066
he's got nothing, but he keeps giving.

456
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,600
Like what?

457
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,033
I don't know.

458
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,700
He cooks meals, he gives gifts.

459
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,767
He just constantly gives.

460
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,133
It's because he has a motive.

461
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,667
We always have leeches around us.

462
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,667
Those who cater to us,
hoping to pick up our leftovers.

463
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:47,367
That's precisely my point.

464
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:51,300
He wants nothing,

465
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,867
but he keeps giving.

466
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,834
So he's never self-conscious,
but confident as ever.

467
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,033
Ever since…

468
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,166
he moved in,

469
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,433
the house feels like a home.

470
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,100
Se-yeon smiles a lot.

471
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,133
Se-yeon always smiles.

472
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,633
Nope.

473
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,667
Not her professional smile.
Her real smile is different.

474
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,200
I've seen it.

475
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,533
She's just never shown it to me.

476
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,033
You okay?

477
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,166
Se-yeon.

478
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,033
I… really like you.

479
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
What?

480
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,767
I like Grandma.

481
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,633
I like you.

482
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,500
I like this place.

483
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,066
I like everything.

484
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,066
I'm fine. I can walk. I can--

485
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,367
You drank too much.

486
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:37,500
I know the pass code. I know it.

487
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,967
Jin-suk, sorry. We had a get-together
at work. I think he drank too much.

488
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,834
What time is it?

489
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,567
I sent him off to work,
but he's returned an absolute mess.

490
00:33:55,633 --> 00:34:01,367
Se-yeon, I love everything here.

491
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,166
Please go easy on him next time.

492
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,100
Se-yeon.

493
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,100
Get it together.

494
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,667
I can walk.

495
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:10,667
Seo Yoon-hee…

496
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,300
why do you like this fool?

497
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:23,767
Se-yeon.

498
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,600
-I like you.
-You idiot.

499
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,400
Ms. Ja.

500
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,333
Oh, good morning.

501
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,934
What are you doing up?

502
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:55,033
Moon-seong came home wasted
after his first day at work.

503
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,333
Ri Moon-seong!

504
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:03,467
Good morning, sir.

505
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Oh, hi.

506
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Grandma.

507
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,500
Grandma, you're up early.

508
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:17,800
You said you'd be back
as soon as you clocked out.

509
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:21,066
You made me wait all night long.

510
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:24,900
Grandma, I'm sorry.

511
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,967
My co-workers kept insisting I go.

512
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,166
I couldn't get out of it.

513
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,934
Did you wait long?

514
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,667
I'm kidding.

515
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,400
I'm kidding, child.

516
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,867
I hear your first outing went quite well.

517
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:47,967
Apparently, you were quite popular
with everyone.

518
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,934
I'm so proud of you.

519
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,600
I didn't do very much,

520
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:58,100
but people just take a liking to me.

521
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,000
You must be hungry.
Why don't you drink this first?

522
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
What is this?

523
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,734
It's to calm your guts.

524
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,433
Grandma, thank you.

525
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:20,066
Moon-seong,

526
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:24,300
I love that I can wait for you

527
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,834
or worry about you

528
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,333
or yell at you
for coming home drunk and late.

529
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,834
You have no idea

530
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:41,133
how much joy these little things bring me.

531
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,033
My dear.

532
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:53,233
I'm sorry. I forget you're not a child.

533
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,500
Grandma,

534
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,166
it's fine.

535
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,834
Grandma, thanks to you,

536
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,867
I'm learning that it's a wonderful thing

537
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:14,133
to have someone wait for you
and worry about you.

538
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,133
Your wife won't be happy to hear that.

539
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,233
Of course, my wife does that too.

540
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
It's just not the same.
We're related by blood.

541
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,633
Yes, you're right.

542
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,467
Grandma, this is so good.

543
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,967
You're so handsome, my grandson.

544
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,633
I haven't even washed yet.

545
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,433
Ah, yes.

546
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,834
This is Ri Moon-seong.
He'll be working with you starting today.

547
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,633
I look forward to working with you.

548
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,233
Let's welcome him!

549
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:11,433
His name is Ri Moon-seong.
Currently living with the chairwoman.

550
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,834
He has a wife,
and Mr. Kim says he's in his early 30s.

551
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,600
He came to work with Miss Park,
and he'll start his first shift today.

552
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:24,600
Mr. Kim will inform us when he knows more.

553
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,166
A married cousin.

554
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:38,233
Even if they knew each other as kids,
they couldn't be close.

555
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:39,967
Sorry?

556
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:43,967
This is interesting. You may go.

557
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:57,333
RI MOON-SEONG'S
PERSONAL INFORMATION

558
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:02,533
It's been a while
since you seemed at peace.

559
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,600
Is that so?

560
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:11,066
My heart flutters,

561
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:12,934
my energy soars,

562
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,467
and I have reason to be excited.

563
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,000
It's all thanks to you.

564
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,400
It's nothing, ma'am.

565
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:25,934
My life has been full of tragedies,

566
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,266
and I was angry at the heavens for that.

567
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:32,300
If I think back now,

568
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,233
I'm thankful for everything.

569
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,300
I have nothing but thanks.

570
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:43,834
You'll continue to find greater happiness,
Chairwoman.

571
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,333
Chairwoman!

572
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,900
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

573
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,800
Let's go inside.

574
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:21,934
Hang on.

575
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,900
Come here. Yeah, over here.

576
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,133
Grab my luggage.

577
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,133
Take it to my room.

578
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:54,533
-Over there, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

579
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,000
Open that.

580
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:30,967
Try that on.

581
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,600
It's a casual fit,
so it should fit you okay.

582
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,066
Why are you giving me this?

583
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:43,734
It's a bribe.

584
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,266
Four million won should be enough, right?

585
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,633
You're bribing me?

586
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,233
We're going to be future in-laws.
I'm allowed to grease your palms.

587
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,367
-I don't think so.
-Fine, then.

588
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,333
Return it.

589
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:04,166
Rest well.

590
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,433
Is four million won not enough?

591
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,166
How about 40 million?

592
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
400 million?

593
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,300
Se-yeon wants to protect the hotel,

594
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,467
but you are a variable.

595
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,367
How am I a variable?

596
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:29,066
If the chairwoman decides
to add you as her heir--

597
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,300
I'm not interested in that.

598
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,200
That's great,
but the chairwoman may feel differently.

599
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:41,500
If you do get a share of the inheritance--

600
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:44,433
I should just hand it over to you?

601
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:47,934
You're clever. That was quick.

602
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,934
I could just give it to Se-yeon.

603
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,533
Why are you complicating things?

604
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,367
I want what she wants,

605
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,834
so I can give it to her myself.

606
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,367
I thought this was because you loved her,
but I guess you just have a wicked heart.

607
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:06,433
What?

608
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,900
Helping your beloved fulfill her dream,
while wanting to ruin it

609
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:13,667
if you're not the one to give it to her,
those two are incomparable.

610
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,233
-What's it to you?
-What?

611
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,967
You're leaving anyway.
You should bag what you can.

612
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,266
If you get your inheritance,
I'll pay what you're owed.

613
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:28,600
If you don't get the inheritance,
you still get to keep the money.

614
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,233
No loss on your part.

615
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,834
What do you mean, "no loss"?

616
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,000
My sister's going to have to listen
to despicable words.

617
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:39,266
I'd have to deal with your filthy face.

618
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:46,100
When did you two become so close?

619
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:50,166
I have nothing for someone
who can't let go of his ex-fiancée.

620
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,734
Watch what you say.

621
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,967
I don't have to watch my words
before someone

622
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:56,400
who has nothing but money
to offer a woman.

623
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,767
It's been a while
since I actually felt this bothered.

624
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,333
Son of a bitch.

625
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,000
He's pissing me off.

626
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,767
Stop!

627
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,400
I've been sitting here for 20 minutes.

628
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:40,066
I haven't seen your face once.

629
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:43,800
That means you've been gone
for 20 minutes.

630
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,133
Well, a guest--

631
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,233
A guest what?

632
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,767
A guest wanted to speak to me.

633
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:54,266
You were gone for 20 minutes
because a guest wanted to speak to you.

634
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,433
Yes.

635
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,734
So you'd be gone for an hour
if a guest offers to eat with you?

636
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,500
-Sorry. It'll never happen--
-Take off your uniform.

637
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:04,900
Sorry?

638
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,133
Take it off.

639
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,433
I'm sorry.

640
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,667
Go to the laundry room.

641
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:16,333
Stay there, run the washing machines,
and never show your face.

642
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:22,033
Sorry.

643
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,333
You wish to sell this hotel,

644
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:34,734
so I doubt you insulted him
for training purposes.

645
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,300
Look, Miss Park.

646
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:38,500
Yes, Mr. Kim.

647
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:44,767
What would happen
if my cousin gets his inheritance

648
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:47,800
and partners up with me?

649
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,600
Hey, everyone.

650
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:06,700
Hey, Ji-won.

651
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:10,066
Good to see you. How have you been?

652
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:12,700
I've been well.
Everything good with all of you?

653
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:13,834
Of course.

654
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,667
Wow. You really went all out
with today's theme.

655
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:22,200
I heard the party theme was retro.

656
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:23,567
-Yeah.
-What?

657
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,967
It's retro.

658
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:28,433
Oh, right? I thought I misunderstood.

659
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,166
I didn't know you'd try this hard.

660
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,934
You take things too seriously.

661
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,800
So, are you back for good?

662
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:41,066
Yeah. You know, living ten years abroad,

663
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,100
I really missed Korea,
and studying wasn't easy either.

664
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,700
Yeah. I mean, it's Harvard Law,
of all places.

665
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:52,767
But what can we do? People like us,
we have to try our best to make a living.

666
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,934
I so envy you, Ji-won.

667
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:59,567
Finding a good husband is
the best way to go.

668
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:01,333
So true.

669
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,266
Stop it.

670
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:07,033
Excuse me.

671
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:12,467
Oh, I should introduce you to her.
I told you about my new sister-in-law.

672
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:16,433
-From North Korea?
-Oh, okay.

673
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,533
Are none of you South Koreans?

674
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,266
Yeah. We are.

675
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:26,100
Ji-won, are they speaking English
because they can't speak Korean?

676
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,500
Oh, no. That's not why--

677
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:30,700
Wow, how annoying.

678
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:36,133
You're speaking Korean,
but they continue to reply in English.

679
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,867
Are their ears from Korea
and their mouths from America?

680
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:46,166
Is it because she's from North Korea?
She lacks decorum.

681
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:49,100
See? She speaks Korean fine!

682
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,467
Who lacks decorum here?

683
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:55,467
She hasn't been here for long.
She's never been out like this either.

684
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,266
Please try to understand.

685
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,700
What is there to understand?

686
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:02,433
We should be understanding them.

687
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,867
We're Koreans, and yet you speak English
just to embarrass people.

688
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,400
How uncivilized.

689
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:14,500
-What?
-Uncivilized?

690
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:15,834
Sorry. Sorry.

691
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,567
Ji-won, let's go.

692
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,333
Sorry. Sorry.

693
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:24,767
Did she call us uncivilized?

694
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,900
Who do they think they are?

695
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,900
Why should a classy woman like you
befriend such rude women?

696
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:36,433
Those people aren't your friends.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

697
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,734
They got on your nerves too, right?

698
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,667
You shouldn't bottle up your anger.

699
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:46,567
I'll listen, so say all you want to them.

700
00:49:48,533 --> 00:49:49,767
Try it. Hurry.

701
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:52,734
You rude bitches.

702
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,667
-More!
-More?

703
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,467
You're all hypocrites!

704
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,233
You think you're all that?

705
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,433
You suck!

706
00:50:09,066 --> 00:50:10,734
How's that? Isn't that better?

707
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,133
Yeah. So much better.
Let's hang out together today.

708
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:16,834
Okay, let's go.

709
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,667
Hey, guys. You look amazing.

710
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,834
Thank you.

711
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,934
-Amazing?
-Amazing.

712
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
There you are.

713
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:35,233
Chairwoman,

714
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,333
how about another visit to the hospital?

715
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:40,467
No.

716
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:43,734
Not right now.

717
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,867
If I go back now,

718
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:52,233
it'll be hard for me to leave.

719
00:50:56,133 --> 00:51:01,567
Please give me some time
to put my affairs in order.

720
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,133
There's something I'd like to do.

721
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,533
This is…

722
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,467
my last request of you.

723
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:19,967
Can I have your number?

724
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:24,266
When did you get this?

725
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,066
Mr. Jeong gave it to us.

726
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:29,867
This new phone model
is very popular in China.

727
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,900
Except it lacks your number.

728
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:36,333
Thank you.

729
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:41,133
Ji-won, what was that girl's name?

730
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:43,567
Who?

731
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,266
What was it?

732
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,467
Harvard? Harmard?

733
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,967
Harvard, yeah. It's Sang-ji.

734
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:52,800
Sang-ji. Her surname?

735
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:55,667
Gwak. Gwak Sang-ji.

736
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,767
Seo Yoon-hee, what's up? How are you?

737
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:13,166
I can't talk for long
because I'm working right now.

738
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,266
I have a question.

739
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,734
Yeah, shoot.

740
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,734
Do you know a Gwak Sang-ji
among the Koreans from our school?

741
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,233
Gwak Sang-ji? I don't think so.

742
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,233
I think she's pretending to attend
our law school.

743
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:29,333
Can you look into it, just in case? Okay?

744
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,700
Yeah.

745
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,233
Jin-suk, what are you doing?

746
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,133
-Yes?
-Come over here.

747
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,734
Yes, I'm coming.

748
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:42,533
Se-yeon!

749
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,667
Get in.

750
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,400
-Did you wait long?
-No.

751
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:56,467
-It was tough for your first day, huh?
-Oh, no. It wasn't very tough.

752
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,934
How was the laundry room?

753
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,700
Oh, I liked it there.

754
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:04,800
How can you be so amenable?

755
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:10,033
It's nice to work in a place
where it's not too hot or too cold.

756
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,133
I guess you could think of it like that.

757
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,867
Why were you gone for so long
during your shift?

758
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,367
Can I ask you something?

759
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,633
Why did I break up with him?

760
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,867
Dong-jae must've done
something wrong, right?

761
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:43,467
I had my reasons.

762
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:52,700
So, are you willing to get back together?

763
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Not at all.

764
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,033
Then it's fine.

765
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,200
What?

766
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Today…

767
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,433
I may have had a rough exchange with him.

768
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,266
Watch out!

769
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:20,066
Damn that idiot! You all right?

770
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:23,900
Are you okay?

771
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:28,934
Whoa. Shit.

772
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:31,233
Oh, yes.

773
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,734
I'm okay.

774
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,100
Are you okay?

775
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,834
Yeah.

776
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,934
These South Korean bastards
drive too recklessly.

777
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,333
Thank you.

778
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,834
There aren't many cars in the North,

779
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,734
so there aren't many people
who drive recklessly.

780
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:55,567
Gosh.

781
00:55:57,967 --> 00:55:59,233
That was scary.

782
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,266
Have a good day?

783
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:18,133
-Do I look like it?
-Yeah.

784
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,266
I went out with Jin-suk.

785
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,800
I think that made me feel better.

786
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,900
-Jin-suk?
-Yeah, our sister-in-law.

787
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:28,467
You seem to be getting closer.

788
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:32,033
The more time I spend with her,
the more I realize she's a good person.

789
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,934
She's such an open person.

790
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,700
She's my kind of girl.

791
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:38,400
Don't get too attached.

792
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,934
What do you mean?

793
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
He's getting all serious again.

794
00:56:57,233 --> 00:57:00,734
What kind of life did Moon-seong have?

795
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:04,867
He can do anything. He's so proper too.

796
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,133
How do I put this?

797
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,734
He seems to be just the man
Grandma and our family needs right now.

798
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:18,233
I wish he had appeared sooner.

799
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,333
Se-yeon.

800
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,200
They aren't here to stay.

801
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,033
If it weren't for Ms. Ja's condition,
they wouldn't be here.

802
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,567
Once the chairwoman passes,
they will leave.

803
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:37,700
They have their lives back home.

804
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:40,166
They can start over here.

805
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:42,266
Don't get too attached.

806
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,700
Don't rely on or trust him.

807
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:52,367
Is there something else
I should know about Moon-seong?

808
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:57,166
No. I'm not saying
you should be wary of him.

809
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:02,567
He's here as a guest,
so he'll leave as a guest.

810
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,066
I will find a way to make him stay.

811
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:22,934
Don't get too attached.

812
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,567
Don't rely on or trust him.

813
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:29,500
He came here as a guest,
so he'll leave as a guest.

814
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,700
A luggage carrier?

815
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:37,600
I'm the best luggage carrier there is.
Carrying them to and from the Tumen River.

816
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,400
Watch out!

817
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,433
Damn that idiot! You all right?

818
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,533
Miss Park?

819
00:58:58,467 --> 00:58:59,467
Miss Park?

820
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:04,166
Why the long face now?

821
00:59:05,734 --> 00:59:08,800
Is this about Bae Dong-jae…

822
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,867
I think not.

823
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:13,667
Is this about your cousin?

824
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,133
Oh, that laundry-room thing.

825
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,133
Why the hell is he working
in the laundry room?

826
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:26,867
What if this makes him hate the hotel?

827
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:29,800
Should I not have brought him here?

828
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,100
Our Prince Charming won't keep his shares

829
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,734
just to give them to Se-jun, right?

830
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,100
What if the hotel gets sold,
and you and I will have to

831
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:45,934
start our lives all over from scratch?

832
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,867
You're thinking too hard.

833
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:51,600
As the protagonist of this fight,
you have the final say.

834
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:56,633
The one with the final say
always has to be rational.

835
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,233
Damn, you're slick with words.

836
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,033
Hey, Yoo Jae-heon!

837
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:22,467
-Whoa! What the hell?
-Yoo Jae-heon?

838
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,467
Yoo Jae-heon.

839
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:11,500
CURTAIN CALL

840
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:14,967
I should stop coming here.

841
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,700
-Why?
-Because you're here.

842
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:21,767
With 250,000 yuan,
I can go to South Korea.

843
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,433
Don't overburden yourself.

844
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:30,667
Even if it makes my heart beat,
I can't possibly abandon our hotel.

845
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:31,734
Why not?

846
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,066
My grandmother used us all as tools.

847
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,400
We'll find out once we sell the hotel.

848
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,934
That idiot has no idea how I feel.

849
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,166
Park Se-yeon?

850
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,533
We are still like parallel lines.

851
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,800
Soon you'll want to cross that line.

852
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,133
Do you love him?
