1
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:31,133
CURTAIN CALL

2
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:41,967
This man.

3
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,600
He's a theater actor named Yoo Jae-heon.

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,567
No way.

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,700
THEATER ACTOR YOO JAE-HEON

6
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:12,000
A STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,300
What would you like?

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,266
Yes. Iced Americano.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
You have these in North Korea too?

10
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,567
Hey, don't underestimate us.

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,100
I guess you wouldn't know.

12
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,667
It's very popular
among the youngsters up north.

13
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,266
Iced Americano.

14
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,033
You think that's all we have?

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,266
We have double espresso chip
Frappuccinos too.

16
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,033
Watch out!

17
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,767
Damn that idiot! You all right?

18
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:01,867
After Grandma passes,

19
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,533
I'll return to my old life.

20
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,600
So as long as I'm here,

21
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,533
you can make use of me however you want.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,900
This makes no sense.

23
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,734
What time is it?

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,233
I sent him off to work,
but he's returned an absolute mess.

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,834
…and I have nothing to tell you.

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Moon-seong.

27
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,100
Oh, Se-yeon.

28
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,700
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Good day.

29
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:11,500
-Se-yeon.
-Yes?

30
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,633
Se-yeon, aren't you getting off work?

31
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,834
Moon-seong.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
I heard the news.

33
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,000
What news?

34
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,567
That…

35
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,266
Ra-kyung was transferred.

36
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,500
I hadn't known her long,

37
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,433
but she really was
a very accomplished worker.

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,734
It's really unfair, isn't it?

39
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,734
Yeah.

40
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,166
I heard you two were particularly close,

41
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,266
since long ago.

42
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,033
I wondered how you were feeling,

43
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,000
so I thought I'd stop by.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,834
Thank you for caring.

45
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,033
Anyhow, I heard you gave Se-jun
a hefty piece of your mind.

46
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,133
I knew you'd stand up for yourself.

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
I think you're awesome
in a revolutionary way!

48
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,667
Se-yeon, are you all right?

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,867
Yes, I'm fine. I just miss Ra-kyung.

50
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,567
Work is piling up.

51
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,867
I'll have to work late.

52
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
You can go first.

53
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,667
Okay.

54
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,066
EPISODE 9

55
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,166
Welcome to Korea.

56
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,567
Is there someplace you want to go?

57
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:10,500
It's your first time here,
so how about the amusement park?

58
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,100
-No, thank you.
-I'm joking, dude.

59
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,834
-Let's go.
-To where?

60
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
To your place. Get in.

61
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,834
TOWN SALES SHOP

62
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,266
All right.

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,767
Oh, this is nice and cozy.

64
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,533
Just stay here for a while.

65
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
What?

66
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:03,567
Listen, you stand out too much.
Your accent and all.

67
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,100
Nobody will question a thing
if you stay here.

68
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,700
So this is my place?

69
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,200
I need to see my grandmother right now.
Lead the way.

70
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,867
Be patient, boy.

71
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:21,400
Shoving your way in
will accomplish nothing.

72
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:24,667
There's already an impostor
pretending to be you.

73
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:28,066
Even if you just appeared and said,
"Hey, I'm the real grandson,"

74
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,734
nobody would believe you.

75
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:40,166
I am me, Ri Moon-seong.
What else do they need?

76
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,834
Listen to me.

77
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,867
I provided fake passports to the impostor.

78
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,767
Hey, hey, buddy.

79
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,333
Relax. Calm down, calm down.

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,567
Why are you so impatient?

81
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:56,166
It won't take long.

82
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,800
Hey, let's figure out the situation first.

83
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:01,900
Figure out who to contact
to get this ball rolling.

84
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,200
Hey, also,

85
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:09,233
if you need to make a call, use this.

86
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Here.

87
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,233
Use this if you need to buy something.

88
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,633
Oh, right.

89
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:19,967
You…

90
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,100
You know how to use this?

91
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,767
Also,
I really don't like asking for favors.

92
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,600
But let me ask this of you:

93
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,233
Please keep quiet and lay low.

94
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,834
Look at the big picture.

95
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,066
I'm trusting you.

96
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,300
Remember that, yeah?

97
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,500
See you.

98
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh, this?

99
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,867
It's no big deal.

100
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,834
Comrade Moon-seong.

101
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,600
I wish…

102
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,834
you would stop…

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,567
trying so hard.

104
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,734
What are you talking about?

105
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,066
They already said it's impossible

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,333
to keep my liver from failing.

107
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,467
Nonsense.
They said you just need a new liver.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,033
Which costs a fortune.

109
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,266
Comrade Jin-suk,

110
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,700
listen carefully.

111
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:27,867
I'll never hurt anyone again for money.

112
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,400
Comrade.

113
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,367
Saving you is my duty,

114
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,533
and recovering your health is yours.

115
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
You understand?

116
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,033
Miss Park.

117
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,166
You're here so early.

118
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:31,867
Or… did you not go home at all?

119
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,867
Can you cancel everything for today?

120
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,033
Yes, miss.

121
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,467
Good morning.

122
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,567
Oh, good morning!

123
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,166
Good day, Miss Park.

124
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,633
Why the formal greeting? It's awkward.

125
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,266
This is my workplace, after all.

126
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,967
I think everyone knows we're cousins, no?

127
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,934
Yes, of course. You're right indeed.

128
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,800
I just think it's necessary
to distinguish public and private matters.

129
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,433
But what brings you here?

130
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:01,367
-I thought I'd drop by this morning.
-I see.

131
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
You work so hard at everything.

132
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,133
Moon-seong is working really hard.

133
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,867
That's right.

134
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:21,967
I think working hard is
the only talent I have, really.

135
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:24,867
I disagree.

136
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I think you have many talents.

137
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah.

138
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,200
I guess I do have a few talents.

139
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,700
Keep up the good work. You too, everyone.

140
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,100
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

141
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,667
I know things haven't been easy.

142
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:24,500
Hang in there a while longer.

143
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,333
It'll all be over soon.

144
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,333
Over?

145
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,266
Why? Isn't that what you wanted?

146
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,266
When you say "over,"

147
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,467
you mean

148
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,333
when Grandma passes, right?

149
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,800
Mr. Jeong.

150
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:47,834
I…

151
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,834
don't want Grandma to die.

152
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,066
Me neither.

153
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,200
When I think about Se-yeon
and the whole family

154
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:03,033
finding out that this was all a lie,

155
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,600
I feel so scared.

156
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,233
We do want this to end quickly,

157
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,500
but we also don't,
if Grandma's death is at the end of this.

158
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,667
Sounds like you've grown fond of her.

159
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,100
The chairwoman seems so happy.

160
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,133
I owe it all to you two.

161
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,233
Still, we're reaching our limit
playing these roles.

162
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,967
I said three months from the get-go,

163
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:43,367
travel visas expire in three months.

164
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,834
Say you must return to China
due to visa issues.

165
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,467
Then nothing will seem strange.

166
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,967
Wait. So…

167
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:58,734
Right.

168
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,333
Regardless of the chairwoman's health,

169
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,233
you will leave.

170
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,667
Thank you.

171
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,266
Wow, that's amazing.
Look at the night lights.

172
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:42,066
What do you think?
This is the capital of South Korea.

173
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,500
What do we do now?

174
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:52,233
Before we do anything,
shouldn't we make you presentable?

175
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,200
Get you the South Korean vibe, you know?

176
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,533
No, wait. First, lose the death glare.

177
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Grandma.

178
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,367
Oh, Se-yeon.

179
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,967
Why are you looking for me so early?

180
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,934
What do you mean?
You're making it sound like we're distant.

181
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,967
Oh, my.

182
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,467
Grandma.

183
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,767
I was wondering--

184
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,834
Yeah?

185
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,333
If…

186
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,233
Moon-seong were…

187
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,700
Come on in.

188
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,133
Let's go. Take a seat.

189
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,400
How am I?

190
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,166
Aren't I better?

191
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm in such a good mood these days.

192
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,567
Maybe that's why,
but I feel light as a feather.

193
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,934
We'll need to do a thorough checkup
to know for sure, but…

194
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,700
-Okay, so?
-Basically, your mood is lifting you up.

195
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,600
-What?
-Nothing's changed.

196
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,734
Are you sure nothing has changed?

197
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,333
She seems the healthiest
I've seen her in weeks.

198
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,867
She's more active, and she laughs more.

199
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
She eats well and moves around well.

200
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,400
Ms. Ja, let's go to the hospital.
Let's get you a thorough checkup--

201
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,567
This doctor's always been this way.

202
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:53,200
Does it give you comfort
to speak so bluntly about everything?

203
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,900
You know your own condition
better than I do.

204
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,700
I do.

205
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Well, but Mr. Jeong is right.

206
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,233
I've been more vibrant--

207
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,166
laughing more, eating more

208
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,467
and moving around more.

209
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,066
I'm never returning to the hospital.

210
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,834
This is my choice.

211
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,734
I won't ever regret this.
That's what I'm saying.

212
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,700
You may go now.

213
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,600
Please take your medication.

214
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,233
All that nagging.

215
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,767
Grandma, you okay?

216
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,166
You're not concerned, are you?

217
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,667
I've always been concerned.

218
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,734
So I won't tell you not to worry.

219
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:25,567
Just don't let your concerns grow.

220
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:36,166
Se-yeon, you were saying something?

221
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,633
No, it's nothing.

222
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Is that so?

223
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,333
This man.

224
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,967
He's a theater actor named Yoo Jae-heon.

225
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,533
Se-yeon!

226
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,300
You scared me.

227
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:22,100
Did I scare you? Sorry.

228
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,734
So, you going to work?

229
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,133
Yes, yes.

230
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:29,400
Se-yeon, let's go.
I'll take you to work today.

231
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:32,133
Don't you have a night shift today?

232
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Yes, that's right.

233
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:37,066
Spare yourself the trouble, then.

234
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,600
It's fine.

235
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,400
Maybe it's because of my night shift,
but I'm free all morning.

236
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,567
Se-yeon, let's go.

237
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,233
I have a client meeting today.

238
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,633
I might have to stop by
before I go to work.

239
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,033
Is that right?

240
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,567
See you.

241
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,600
Why is he like that?

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,433
He's being too nice.

243
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,133
Act normal.

244
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,500
Act normal.

245
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,233
Se-gyu.

246
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Se-gyu.

247
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm not asleep.

248
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,033
Did you fall asleep here?

249
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,567
Aren't you going to work?

250
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,900
No, I have the night shift.

251
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,333
Oh, really?

252
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,934
Se-gyu, I have to ask.

253
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah?

254
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:44,066
Is something…

255
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,133
bothering Se-yeon these days?

256
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,600
I don't know. Why?

257
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,500
Se-gyu, you have a nice bed,
so why are you sleeping on the sofa?

258
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,800
You'd know if you tried it.

259
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:08,266
Sofas are much better than beds.
You get quality sleep here.

260
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,500
Is that right?

261
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:15,834
Well, then, you may continue.

262
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,633
Moon-seong.

263
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,433
Yes, Se-gyu.

264
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,700
Follow me.

265
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,667
What?

266
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,767
Follow me.

267
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Well, where are we going?

268
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,200
Let's go out to eat.

269
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,266
-You want to go out to eat?
-Yes. I'm hungry.

270
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,066
Well, the thing is…

271
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,467
I just don't want to eat alone.

272
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,400
I was actually hungry too.

273
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:03,166
Oh, you poor thing. Let's go.
What do you want to eat?

274
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,934
I'm fine with anything.

275
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,367
Okay, great. Let's eat what I fancy.
Let's go. It's on me.

276
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:14,734
-Going somewhere?
-We're going out to eat. Want to come?

277
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,200
-I must work.
-It was a rhetorical question.

278
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,700
Tell Grandma you're off to work. Let's go.

279
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,166
Wow. It's so nice outside.

280
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
-Feels like we're in Miami.
-Se-gyu.

281
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,300
Jin-suk, come in.

282
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,500
Ji-won, are you busy?

283
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,400
Why? What's going on?

284
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,500
I wanted to see more of Seoul,
but I don't know what to wear.

285
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,567
Huh?

286
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,400
What about this outfit?

287
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,667
-It's cute.
-Do I look like I'm from Seoul?

288
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:25,867
Totally.

289
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,734
Isn't that good?

290
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,500
I love this stretchy stuff, this thing--

291
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,066
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

292
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,633
This is pretty amazing.

293
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,133
This might be good for a detoxification.

294
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,033
-A detoxification?
-Since you drink every day.

295
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,867
Oh, that.

296
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:10,900
You drink so much of that poison
every day,

297
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,600
so a detoxification is crucial,
in my opinion.

298
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,567
Recently, alcohol isn't as tasty.

299
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,667
How is that possible?
Are you sick or something?

300
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,734
Hey, Moon-seong.

301
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:27,467
What's your perspective of me
in your head?

302
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,667
-Can I tell you?
-No, don't.

303
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,133
My mind is so complex these days.

304
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,533
I don't know what to do with my future.

305
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,400
I've been having serious thoughts
about my future.

306
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,533
Se-gyu, the hotel stuff is really--

307
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,767
Hey, I would've jumped right in
if it was my forte.

308
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,867
But, no, it isn't for me.

309
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:55,300
Hey, let's stop the complicated thoughts.
Let's just eat.

310
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,567
This girl, right?

311
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,767
She's pretty famous
among our mutual friends.

312
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,333
In what way?

313
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,300
She tends to exaggerate.

314
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,767
She took lifelong learning courses.

315
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,900
-The extension school?
-Yeah.

316
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,767
That isn't even funny.

317
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,500
Anyway, aren't you taking the bar exam?

318
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:24,100
-Isn't this your last semester?
-Yeah, I need to take it this year.

319
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:28,333
Why haven't you already?
Why drag this out for two years?

320
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,200
Some people can't pass even if they try.

321
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,266
You skipped a year, graduated early,

322
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,266
and you're a genius who bulldozed
through those courses.

323
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,600
Why on earth did you waste two years?

324
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,734
This is why I don't talk to normal people.

325
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
What?

326
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:46,533
Sometimes you need to slow down
if you've been going so fast.

327
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,700
I'm setting a pace
for the normies to catch up.

328
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,033
That's ridiculous.

329
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:55,400
Hey, you said you know someone
who knows this woman, right?

330
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,133
Yeah. Why?

331
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,333
Can you help me out?

332
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:10,633
Se-yeon?

333
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,600
TOWN SALES SHOP

334
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,600
Research tells me the family is in a bind
regarding the inheritance.

335
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,934
Which tells us we must approach

336
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,533
the eldest son.

337
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:57,667
Circumstances show he'll be most pleased
to learn of your existence.

338
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,633
He might even give you
a merry piggyback ride.

339
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,600
The Ri Moon-seong you know is a fake.

340
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,633
Aren't you curious about
who the real Ri Moon-seong is?

341
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,800
Look who we have here.

342
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:44,867
Did I tickle your fancy? Mr. Park Se-jun.

343
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,667
Not all unfamiliar numbers are
phishing scams, you know.

344
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:50,467
You almost missed this big fish.

345
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:54,400
If you're fishing for easy money
with some lousy information,

346
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,467
forget about it.

347
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:59,166
I don't know how you know us,
but we have the real deal.

348
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,533
What'd you say?

349
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,867
Don't ever call or message me again.

350
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:05,934
If you contact me one more time,

351
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,200
I'll take every legal action I can.

352
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,300
Got it?

353
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,600
He-- Hello?

354
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,800
What the…

355
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,867
Mr. Jeong, you old man.

356
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,900
What the hell did you do

357
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,767
to make them fall for a complete fake,
damn it?

358
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:35,867
Wow. Are you, like,
filming a suit commercial?

359
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,400
You've clocked out. What are
you doing out here? Still working?

360
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,433
You brought his hair sample
for the DNA test, right?

361
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:50,767
Oh, that.

362
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,900
Moon-seong's hair sample?
Yeah, I brought it.

363
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,166
Was it really his hair?

364
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,700
Oh, come on.

365
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:04,266
He plucked it from his head
before my very eyes.

366
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,834
Are you sure it was his?

367
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Are you not hearing me?

368
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:12,600
I saw it with my own eyes. Why do you ask?

369
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,233
It's nothing.

370
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,367
Geez.

371
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:21,400
You sat all fancy in your suit
just to ask that question?

372
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,300
Huh?

373
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,400
Hey, I bought some things you--

374
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Where has he gone now?

375
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:44,266
The toilet. Hey, you in the toilet?

376
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,133
Man, that little… Damn it.

377
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:52,467
Where did that little fucker go?

378
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,767
Ma'am, did you see a guy who looks like
a bumpkin around here?

379
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,033
What? You haven't?

380
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:21,500
The wind is chilly. Why are you out here?

381
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,633
You should go back in.

382
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:29,967
Moon-seong, I miss your grandma
a lot today for some reason.

383
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:34,133
Aren't we seeing her
at next year's event, though?

384
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,700
You should go back in now.

385
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,834
I brought you some porridge.

386
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,567
Since Grandma adores you,

387
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,333
she will take good care of you.

388
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,734
Isn't that right, Mother?

389
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,266
You know I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings, right?

390
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,000
You didn't even know about
Moon-seong's existence.

391
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,967
You didn't seem to care about
how Father died.

392
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:09,066
I felt like you only cared about
your family in the South.

393
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,300
So I was jealous.

394
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,133
Mother,

395
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,800
you were so pretty.

396
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:23,700
I was glad to see that you were
as pretty as I'd heard.

397
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,567
But it also made me angry.

398
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,600
The life I'd led with Father felt…

399
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,133
so unfair.

400
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,734
Father! Snap out of it!

401
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,467
Grandma isn't here.

402
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,467
Grandma is in the South, remember?

403
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,700
My Moon-seong is very agile,

404
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,300
so he can run fast too.

405
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:56,934
Just feed him well,
and he'll even enter the Olympics.

406
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,233
Mother, take care of him for me.

407
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,033
Father! Father!

408
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,667
Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

409
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,233
-Is this the Nakwon Hotel?
-Yes, sir. It is.

410
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,533
I'm here to see the chairwoman.
Lead the way.

411
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,433
I'm sorry, but she isn't here right now.

412
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,433
Then who's the most powerful comrade here?

413
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,333
-Sorry?
-Bring them to me.

414
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,233
Sir, our board members
and executives are--

415
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,033
Bring them here now!

416
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,433
Apologies, sir,
but we can't grant your request.

417
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,433
Sir, you're causing a scene.

418
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:01,266
Get lost!

419
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:12,867
Yes.

420
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,233
What?

421
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,100
-Sir, I'm sorry but--
-Stop!

422
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I'm not moving one step from here.

423
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,333
What's going on?

424
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,767
I told you to bring them to me!

425
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,100
Excuse me,

426
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,333
comrade.

427
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,900
Let's not do this here.

428
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,266
How about we talk outside?

429
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,233
You're from my hometown, huh?

430
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,266
Have we met?

431
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,266
Yes, in a way.

432
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,133
I've never seen someone
from my hometown here before.

433
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,567
It's been a while for me too.

434
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,233
So I'm excited too.

435
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:03,333
Now, can't we talk outside?

436
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,533
General manager.

437
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,000
-Is everything okay?
-We are handling it now.

438
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:13,300
You were surprised, huh?

439
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,800
Well done.

440
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:33,967
When did you come here?

441
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,900
It hasn't been long.

442
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,200
Comrade?

443
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:41,834
They've gone inside.

444
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,133
Is that right?

445
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,500
Comrade,
why did you come all the way here?

446
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,967
I have to meet someone.

447
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,166
You?

448
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,100
I have a promise to keep.

449
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,133
Everyone has an aspiration

450
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,800
when they decide to leave their home.

451
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,100
I agree.

452
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,533
So, do you prefer it here?

453
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:42,600
I thought I would…

454
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,934
but I don't.

455
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:50,900
I see.

456
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,867
We keep our homes in here.

457
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Anyhow,

458
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,567
people live all the same, right?

459
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,367
That too.

460
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,500
Comrade.

461
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,433
I'll see you around.

462
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:37,066
Yoon-hee, pick up--

463
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,133
Oh, boy.

464
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,133
Yoon-hee, Yoon-hee.

465
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,367
Hey, Yoon-hee!

466
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,300
Something's happened. It's real big.

467
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,200
Why? What's wrong?

468
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,834
Oh, my… Don't panic, okay?

469
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,533
Ri Moon-seong appeared.

470
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,800
You're there, so what's appeared?

471
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,800
No, you idiot.

472
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:05,667
Not me. I mean--

473
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:09,066
Not Yoo Jae-heon, but the Ri Moon-seong.

474
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,767
The one who should be
in the North is here.

475
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,433
What?

476
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,934
Bring them to me. Bring them here now!

477
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,367
Get lost!

478
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,567
-Miss Jeong.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:38,066
Have you heard anyone use
the North's accent, apart from Mr. Ri?

480
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:41,667
-No, I haven't.
-And in the hotel?

481
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,967
No.

482
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,433
That's right.

483
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,400
It's rare to meet someone from the North.

484
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,266
Do you need anything else?

485
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,066
No. You may leave.

486
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,200
Hey!

487
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,433
Didn't I tell you to lay low?

488
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:28,700
I tell you one thing,
but you don't listen.

489
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:32,200
Where were you?

490
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
The Nakwon Hotel.

491
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,700
Have you gone mad?

492
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,834
Are you sure you saw him?

493
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,533
My eyes are intact and working fine.

494
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,233
Of course I'm sure.

495
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,066
Ri Moon-seong is

496
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,567
in South Korea, but you say

497
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:54,433
he came to the Nakwon Hotel?

498
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Yes!

499
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,400
Man…

500
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,834
I'm sure about this.
Sir, don't you remember?

501
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,033
You gave me some files.

502
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,567
I read them multiple times
for my character analysis.

503
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,567
I can't be mistaken.
He was definitely… Ri Moon-seong.

504
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,867
But you don't think he recognized you?

505
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,800
I don't think he knows who I am.

506
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,400
Now that I think about it,
he didn't ask for my name.

507
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,367
Really?

508
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,734
Man! That means

509
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,100
he might already know.

510
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:31,734
No, I'm uncertain.

511
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,500
Wait, no. I'm not sure.

512
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:40,300
Wait. Nothing's for certain.
I mean, why? Why is he here?

513
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,834
Sir, why do you think he's here?
What does he know?

514
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,834
Why is he here? To do what?

515
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:48,233
Calm down first.

516
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,834
We have two possibilities.

517
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,400
He came here on his own.

518
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,667
-If not…
-Then what?

519
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,233
If not…

520
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,867
Wow! The broth tastes good.

521
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,533
At least you held back.

522
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:17,367
That comrade's accent was just like ours.

523
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,100
That South Korean bastard.

524
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:24,000
You were right.

525
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,800
I can't just reveal myself
and hope everything resolves itself.

526
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:32,433
Wow. You finally get what I'm saying.

527
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,266
But why did you act like you didn't know?

528
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,433
However I act, he'll know who I am.

529
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:47,967
The only ones who know my identity here,
excluding yourself, are those three.

530
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,133
That's right.

531
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,800
I let him know…

532
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,100
that Ri Moon-seong is here.

533
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:57,967
BROTHER SANG-CHEOL

534
00:44:58,033 --> 00:44:59,600
Oh, that startled me.

535
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:01,633
Man, he's got fine timing.

536
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,133
Is he watching? Damn it.

537
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,900
Moon-seong, my walking jackpot.

538
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,000
Hey, I have everything planned out,
so just trust me.

539
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Okay?

540
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,266
My goodness…

541
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:31,033
Oh, gosh.

542
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,133
Sir.

543
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,200
You scared me.

544
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,667
You should've told me you were coming.

545
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,433
-How did you get in here, though?
-Tae-ju.

546
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:48,266
Where have you been?

547
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,834
Huh? Oh, that?

548
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,033
There was a request,
something about a cheating husband.

549
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,834
I needed to collect proof,
so I've been undercover.

550
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:01,700
But, man, the dude was an active scumbag.

551
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,266
I've been on his tail all day.

552
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,133
Man, I'm beat.

553
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,533
Tae-ju.

554
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,133
Tae-ju!

555
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:13,166
Yes, sir.

556
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:18,066
While I was waiting,
I was reminded of the old days.

557
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,600
We didn't have phones and such before.

558
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:24,600
So we went to the teahouse
to make and receive calls, right?

559
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:28,533
Why are you suddenly talking of the past?

560
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:31,300
Yeah, it's all in the past, right?

561
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:35,367
But now, everyone has a phone, right?

562
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:38,100
Apart from when we sleep,

563
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,934
we have our phones in our hands, no?

564
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,100
That's right.

565
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,400
But then, why didn't you…

566
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,333
pick up my call?

567
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:54,100
I came to you directly
because you didn't pick up my call.

568
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:57,000
You don't like seeing me here.

569
00:46:58,266 --> 00:46:59,567
Do you?

570
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,767
That's why…

571
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,333
you should pick up the phone, you punk.

572
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:17,667
Yes, sir.

573
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
Good.

574
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,033
I'm leaving.

575
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,500
They aren't here to stay.

576
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,734
Once the chairwoman passes,
they will leave.

577
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,567
Don't get too attached.

578
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,600
Don't rely on or trust him.

579
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:58,800
He's here as a guest,
so he'll leave as a guest.

580
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,900
Miss Park, it's chilly out.

581
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,233
I want to stay out today.

582
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,567
I feel frustrated.

583
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:15,000
I don't think I can sleep either.

584
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,900
I guess I have too much on my mind.

585
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:21,367
So it seems.

586
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,734
Since it can't be helped, drink this.

587
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,333
Thank you. I was just thinking about it.

588
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:37,367
How did you know?

589
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:41,867
It's good to clear the mind,

590
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:45,967
but I'm worried you'll catch a cold.

591
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:50,400
All right, then. I'll go inside soon.

592
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:55,767
Ms. Yoon.

593
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,200
I have something to ask.

594
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,033
Someone told a big lie,
and I'm the only one…

595
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:10,867
who knows.

596
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,667
Oh, dear.

597
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:14,900
It must be hard on you.

598
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:19,700
But somehow, I understand…

599
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,033
why the person lied.

600
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:26,133
What should I do?

601
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,133
Should I tell the truth…

602
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,033
or should I turn a blind eye?

603
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:40,133
I don't think all lies are bad.

604
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:41,867
Sorry?

605
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:45,900
Is that lie tormenting
the person being lied to?

606
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:48,934
No.

607
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,867
It's actually making the person
rather happy.

608
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:58,600
That's the problem.

609
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,834
I don't know if my words will help…

610
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,533
but if the person believes it to be true,

611
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:11,433
then can you still call that a lie,
or is it the truth?

612
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:14,633
What?

613
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,233
If you don't get caught until the end,
the truth is in the eye of the beholder.

614
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:21,600
Don't you think?

615
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,266
Is that so?

616
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,800
That is, if you don't get caught.

617
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,367
But if you do,

618
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:35,467
it'll cause much more pain

619
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,400
than an honest confession,

620
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,600
because that's what lies do.

621
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,367
I hope I didn't make things
harder for you.

622
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Not at all.

623
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,533
Think carefully.

624
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,467
Everything is left for you to decide.

625
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:33,266
Jae-heon.

626
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:36,467
I'm scared.

627
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,734
As wonderful as all this has been,

628
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,734
if it gets exposed as a lie…

629
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,667
I'm scared it'll punish us
with great misfortune.

630
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:51,533
I'm…

631
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,200
scared of that too.

632
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,200
But, Yoon-hee,

633
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,500
think about why Mr. Jeong
entrusted us with this job.

634
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,300
Ri Moon-seong.

635
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,667
Meeting him helped me understand a little.

636
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,033
What do you mean?

637
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,066
We'll just have to brace ourselves,

638
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,066
so Grandma can be happy until the end.

639
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
I hope that's possible.

640
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,900
Mr. Park Se-jun.

641
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:01,800
What is this about?

642
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:04,934
If you want to set a meeting,
talk to my secretary.

643
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,600
We've talked on the phone already.

644
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,967
Guess I haven't introduced myself.

645
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:13,233
I'm not going to tolerate this.
I thought I clearly warned you.

646
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,600
I'll be calling the police
and taking legal action.

647
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:20,233
Man, you're impatient.

648
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,867
I made the fake passport
for the fake Ri Moon-seong.

649
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:44,467
How's that?

650
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:46,600
You curious?

651
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,433
Are you willing to talk now?

652
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:57,433
You're saying Mr. Jeong planned
the whole thing,

653
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,867
and that this fellow here
is my real family?

654
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,033
Now we're talking.

655
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,734
Where's the proof?

656
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,667
You saw it all.

657
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:12,200
My research and the passport photo.

658
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,066
These can be cooked up easily.
I want concrete proof.

659
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,967
Let me ask you one thing:

660
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:23,166
Why are you so certain
that the fake is the real deal?

661
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:25,300
We conducted a DNA test.

662
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,266
A paternity test?

663
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:39,400
The results were a match.

664
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:45,000
This is commendable.
How did they pull that off?

665
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:47,066
What proof can you give me?

666
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:51,967
What use is there for proof
when the real deal is sitting right here?

667
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:55,033
-This in itself is proof.
-Quit your bullshit.

668
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,133
That DNA test--
Did you conduct it yourself?

669
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:02,133
You probably didn't go with him,
all hand in hand.

670
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,800
He probably used
any hair or fingernail he found.

671
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:07,867
Right?

672
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,834
Now, then,

673
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,600
take him with you to the hospital.

674
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:32,667
Safe trip, my jackpot.

675
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,800
DNA TEST RESULT:
99.999% MATCH

676
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:19,567
I told you, didn't I?

677
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:23,133
You have concrete proof now.

678
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,233
A certificate that you are you.

679
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,967
How's that?

680
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,967
DNA TEST RESULT:
99.999% MATCH

681
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:48,433
Hey, why are you staring at that so much?

682
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,967
Now, let's get out of here.

683
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:07,567
Honey.

684
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,533
Honey.

685
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:16,233
-Yeah.
-Did something happen?

686
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,834
No, nothing happened.

687
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,100
Stop lying.
Your face is really scary right now.

688
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,233
It's nothing. Go to bed.

689
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,567
You always say that.

690
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,033
-Here.
-It looks tasty.

691
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:50,033
It's all done.

692
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,533
Okay, let's eat.

693
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,233
Did Se-gyu come home late
after drinking again?

694
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,400
My goodness.

695
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,533
Thank you for the meal.

696
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,300
This dish always tastes good,
don't you think?

697
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,200
Is that right?

698
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:20,033
As you know, I'm picky with my food.

699
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,266
But my dear cousin's dumpling soup
always tastes good.

700
00:58:26,867 --> 00:58:28,300
Right?

701
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,567
Yeah.

702
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,300
Yes, totally.

703
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,667
You're so lucky
to have a good cook for a husband.

704
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:42,333
He's got more tricks up his sleeve.

705
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,100
Oh, my. You must be happy. So happy.

706
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,233
That sounds like an indirect criticism.

707
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,934
It wasn't,
but a guilty conscience needs no accuser.

708
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,567
Let me get this clear:
I envy Jin-suk, just like you.

709
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:00,133
About what?

710
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,133
I always wonder when I'll get to taste
my wife's properly cooked meal.

711
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,834
-Will that day even come?
-Will you stop it?

712
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,467
How about you, Se-yeon?

713
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,900
Doesn't it taste good?

714
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,433
Yeah.

715
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,467
You grew up being the youngest,

716
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,834
but you must be delighted to have
a nice and great cook in the family now.

717
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Yeah.

718
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,467
Oh, dear. Is it not to your taste?

719
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,266
I guess it's a little bland.

720
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:56,967
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

721
00:59:57,033 --> 01:00:00,567
Really? Then eat up before it cools down.

722
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:10,467
This really tastes good.

723
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:12,233
Moon-seong,

724
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:16,867
may I ask for this dish
whenever I wish to eat it again?

725
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:18,967
Of course. It's no problem.

726
01:00:19,633 --> 01:00:23,300
You only need to call my name,
and I'll make it for you.

727
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:27,033
Oh, my sweet child.

728
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:22,900
CURTAIN CALL

729
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:25,967
Maybe we've been found out.

730
01:01:26,533 --> 01:01:29,867
Even if our play fails,
it'll all be my fault.

731
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:33,867
Do you think you won?
I have something you can't change.

732
01:01:33,934 --> 01:01:35,533
The truth is with me.

733
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,900
You know the terms better than me.

734
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:40,166
I'll think about our marriage.

735
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,900
I must meet my grandma.

736
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,800
May I take this seat?

737
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:50,266
I don't know for how long
I can continue to live as Ri Moon-seong.
