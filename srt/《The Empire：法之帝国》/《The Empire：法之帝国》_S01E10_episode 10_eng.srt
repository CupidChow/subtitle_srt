1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,421
- What's going on? 
 - What is that?

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,351
Ten.

3
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,490
Gosh. The degrees of decomposition are all different.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,461
I can see the recent ones rotting, and some of the old ones can't even be recognized.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,930
It means the culprit has been consistent.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,231
A habitual criminal.

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,800
Who did this?

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,260
Do you think it's relevant to our case?

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,870



10
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,110
We got the warrant for the security cameras.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,721
You don't have any security footage?

12
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,291
How is that possible?

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,390
We're truly sorry, but we really don't have it.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,291
The storage device was broken exactly three days ago,

15
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,500
so nothing was saved.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,961
The device broke down around the time of the incident?

17
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,071
Are you kidding me?

18
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,870
We're not here to fool around.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,171
That's destroying evidence in a homicide case.

20
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,141
We'll see you at the station soon.

21
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,980
Gosh. I'm really sorry.

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,180
We were going to get that fixed, but this happened...

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,220
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,480
We're just going to leave like this? 
    

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,820
They're destroying evidence!

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,021
I'm sure they're lying to us!

27
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:17,001
Right. Let's say that you're right.

28
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:20,060
Joong Jin, if you were the security guard,

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,060
would you be able to get rid of the security footage as you please?

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,031
Or would you be able to say no

31
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,640
when your boss told you to get rid of the security footage?

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,071
Someone else gave him the order!

33
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,271
If he gets arrested for this, he won't be able to work as a security guard.

34
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,740
How will he get a job?

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,180
That's his problem, not ours.

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,981
What about the victim? Don't you care about her?

37
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,720
How can we investigate without the security footage?

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,490
Let's proceed with the digital forensic analysis first.

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,990
We might be able to find some videos.

40
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,160
It's obvious that we can't restore any videos!

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,204
They already overwrote those files with other files!

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,421
I'll get going if we're not going to study today.

43
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,160
- Sit down. 
 - It's not like we'll study today.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,231
- The exam is around the corner. 
 - Hey!

45
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,751
Kang Baek is shocked right now.

46
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,340
You know that he must be shocked the most among us.

47
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,370
Why is that? It wasn't like they were dating.

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,240
I'm not shocked. I'm busy because I'm behind with my studies.

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,810
Don't you think you're being unreasonable?

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,951
I didn't know you were this awful.

51
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,280
Why are you criticizing me when I haven't done a thing?

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,220
How is this criticizing you?

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,120
How could you be this heartless toward Nan Hee?

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,691
It isn't like we are indebted to her.

55
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,331
How are we supposed to behave then?

56
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:03,601
She's right. What are we supposed to do?

57
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,530
Should we go over to the morgue at the NFS and cry our eyes out?

58
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,310
Will our tears make Nan Hee come back from the dead?

59
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,411
What should we do?

60
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,941
Right. What do you expect us to do?

61
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,641
She was murdered.

62
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,650
Nan Hee was murdered!

63
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,680
So what? Are you asking us to catch the culprit?

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,420
This isn't the police university.

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,360
Kang Baek, you're acting really weird.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,460
You should watch what you say. You're getting on my nerves,

67
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,261
and I can finally say this to you.

68
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,960
You were never good enough to join our study group,

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,590
so I would like to ask you to leave our study group.

70
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,171
You're not even on our level.

71
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,900
How dare you lecture me?

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,570
What did you say?

73
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,441
I said you aren't on my level.

74
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,180
- Hey, Jang Ji Yi. 
 - You know I'm right.

75
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,410
This is why I wanted the girls to leave our study group.

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,280
This happened because they joined us when they weren't on our level.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,651
Only people like her would face such an awful death.

78
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,720
- I'm about to be talked about too. 
 - That's enough!

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,020
You crazy wench! Hey!

80
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,490
- Ji Yi! 
 - Have you gone mad?

81
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,261
- Hey! Say that again! 
 - Hey, get off me!

82
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,491
- What did you just say? 
 - Get off me!

83
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,561
- You don't want to be a prosecutor? 
 - Have you gone mad?

84
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:14,567
Hey! How could you say that?

85
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,970
- Let go of me! That lunatic. 
 - Hey!

86
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,270
- What's wrong with her? 
 - How could you say that?

87
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,093
Kang Baek!

88
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,935
Hey, Kang Baek!

89
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:37,190
Let's talk.

90
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,661
About what?

91
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:40,561
Why aren't you answering my calls?

92
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,601
Are you all right?

93
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,130
I'm fine.

94
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,831
What? I shouldn't be okay?

95
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,041
That's not what I meant.

96
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,501
- I think that's what Ah Jeong was alluding to. 
 - Kang Baek.

97
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:54,790
Why did you run after me? What do you want to talk about?

98
00:04:57,241 --> 00:05:01,950
I just wanted... to make sure that you are okay.

99
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,990
I was worried if you have been sleeping and eating well.

100
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,661
I'm fine.

101
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,521
That's why I'm coming to school and studying for my exams.

102
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:13,430
I have a whole group of people at home, worrying about me

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,107
when I skip a meal, so don't be one of them.

104
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,901
I'll get going if that's all.

105
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,601
Kang Baek.

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,289
The culprit...

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,550
Wouldn't that person be the culprit?

108
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,981
What?

109
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:38,620
I think you and I might be the only ones who know.

110
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,821
Should we tell the police?

111
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:45,060
Oh, that.

112
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,760
What do you think? No?

113
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,971
Gosh, right. We might be wrong.

114
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,800
This is driving me crazy.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,901
What do we do?

116
00:05:56,901 --> 00:06:00,741
Someone else might be the culprit, not the person we have in mind.

117
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,781
Who? Who are you talking about?

118
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,885
Me.

119
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,255
What?

120
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,910
I also wished that she was dead too.

121
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,200
   

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,380
   

123
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,930
 Are you happy that I'm gone? 

124
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,430
 Are you happy that I'm dead? 

125
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,225
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

126
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,321
"The law is harsh, but it is the law."

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,980
Who here still thinks this was said by Socrates?

128
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,240
I hope none of you here thinks that.

129
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,221
All right. I'll cut some slack for you.

130
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:06,861
Only recently this was removed from our textbooks.

131
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:09,830
In 2004, the Constitutional Court stated

132
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,800
that abiding by the law was based on

133
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,370
the just law and proper execution of the law.

134
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,710
Afterward, this saying was removed from our textbooks.

135
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,640
Just like someone once said,

136
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,511
"Being just means knowing whom to criticize."

137
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:31,121
I'll quote a line from a book, "A Good Discriminator."

138
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,651
"The world is still..."

139
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,597
- No way. 
 - What?

140
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
What's this about?

141
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,831
We're in the middle of class.

142
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:27,891
This... Which one of the two is it?

143
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,700
   

144
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,754
   

145
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,631
Won Kyung, it's me, Moo Ryul.

146
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:59,171
The man in Hong Nan Hee's photo on the Internet.

147
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,680
Isn't that Kang Baek?

148
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,153
What are you talking about? Kang Baek?

149
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,245
Look at this, Older Mi Ja.

150
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,471
- What do you think? 
 - Who is that?

151
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,141
You remember her, right?

152
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,740
The girl Kang Baek brought home the other day.

153
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,381
- She's dead. 
 - What?

154
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,701
She must have been too arrogant.

155
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,843
What do you think?

156
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:46,043
Will the guys be sad or scared now?

157
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,040
   

158
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,814
Goodness! Hello.

159
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,181
What do you think you're doing here?

160
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:13,580
Get out.

161
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,980
Ma'am.

162
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,521
I'm in charge of the recent case.

163
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,251
I'm Detective Ji Gu Won of the Regional Investigation Unit.

164
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,220
So what?

165
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,391
A detective must stay within the scene of the crime.

166
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:27,060
This isn't the scene of the crime. This is my office.

167
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,901
If you want to interview me, set up an appointment.

168
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,730
If I did, I wouldn't be able to see this.

169
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,271
Gosh, hold on.

170
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:37,285
Wait. These are completely new!

171
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:41,475
I'm still using my old computer that barely turns on.

172
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,778
Can I ask you why you're throwing them out?

173
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,620
Watch what you say. You're in my office.

174
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,661
Is your office considered sacred or something?

175
00:12:55,661 --> 00:13:00,490
The storage device broke down on the day of the incident,

176
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,761
so there's no security footage.

177
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:06,171
I was so frustrated. That's why I came here to see you,

178
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:10,240
and of all times, you're throwing out your computer.

179
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,370
And the director of the university is busy trying to kick me out

180
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,263
instead of welcoming me.

181
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,550
Gosh. You're hurting my feelings.

182
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm not in charge of the security footage.

183
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,151
If you need my help, go through the proper channels,

184
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:27,475
and proceed with the written request.

185
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:30,090
This is my place of work.

186
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,960
This isn't some reception area where I listen to your frustration.

187
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,060
I can't afford to get wrapped up in this distraction.

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,769
I have way too much work.

189
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
How odd.

190
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,271
People show a sense of desperation

191
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:47,737
when they lose even minor items like a bicycle,

192
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:51,480
but you don't seem desperate to solve this case at all.

193
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,850
You look like you don't want to catch the culprit

194
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,191
when one of your students was murdered.

195
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,767
   

196
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,655
What are you talking about?

197
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,671
The culprit must be arrested. You must catch the culprit.

198
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,835
That's your job, isn't it?

199
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,080
Of course, it is.

200
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,385
It's my duty to find out the culprit.

201
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,565
Were you busy yesterday?

202
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,580
Yes, my mother wanted to see me.

203
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,750
Didn't you say she lived in Gangwon Province?

204
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,655
In Yangyang.

205
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,325
I see.

206
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,392
You went to Yangyang?

207
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,161
I just told you.

208
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:20,301
My mother wanted to see me.

209
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:23,479
That's what I told you clearly.

210
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:27,979
Right. You went to Yangyang out of the blue.

211
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,300
How did the meeting with her go?

212
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,179
- Pardon? 
 - How did it go?

213
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:44,740
I don't understand what you're asking me now.

214
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,101
- Are you recording this? 
 - Maybe you're recording it.

215
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,560
I didn't know there was no trust between you and me.

216
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,100
I learned from the best.

217
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,970
So you have nothing on you?

218
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,131
Am I supposed to have something?

219
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:02,421
Attorney Nam, you sound like a different person.

220
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,650
Did you resolve the issue without a problem?

221
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,890
What do you mean?

222
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,011
What issue must I resolve?

223
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,791
Senior Prosecutor Han's suspension.

224
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,387
Oh, that.

225
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,414
I guess you had another problem to solve.

226
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:35,047
A girl is dead, and the murderer is nearby,

227
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,410
but I'm surrounded by people who will pin the murder on me if they get a chance.

228
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,680
So I'm trying to stay focused and keep myself safe.

229
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,920
Gosh, I must be careful around everyone.

230
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,256
Hey.

231
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:53,315
Is the present all you care about? What about your future?

232
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,701
I'll consider that once it's confirmed you're not the killer.

233
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,801
You crazy jerk!

234
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,338
- Exactly. 
 - Right. I did this.

235
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,161
You don't have to make it look so obvious. I know.

236
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:39,909
I don't want to see you either, so I'll keep it short.

237
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,870
The murder case in the law school at Minguk University.

238
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,270
Is it true that she was dating Kang Baek?

239
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,521
Who said it was a murder case?

240
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,380
The autopsy report hasn't come out yet.

241
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,100
You're not denying that she was his girlfriend.

242
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,190
- That's... 
 - I heard it from your sister.

243
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,290
It was more like blackmailing than talking. So she came over to your house.

244
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,891
We got a divorce years ago. Why do you still talk to her?

245
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:09,901
Besides, you still don't know the legal condition for blackmail?

246
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,731
Should I give you a law book as a present?

247
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:14,200
Why are you here? Did you expect me to be nice to you?

248
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,508
- If you're angry, leave. 
 - You know what?

249
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,711
I know you.

250
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,981
You may be able to fool the others but not me.

251
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:24,380
There's something going on. I'm sure of it

252
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,965
but I don't care. I don't want to either.

253
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,451
I won't even be curious about what's going on with you,

254
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,217
but...

255
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,541
Kang Baek.

256
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,541
Our son.

257
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,560
If anything bad happens to Kang Baek...

258
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,061
Don't be ridiculous.

259
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:50,370
- What? 
 - It's too late to act like you are something to him. It's not even funny.

260
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,255
One more thing.

261
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,870
Nothing bad's going to happen to Kang Baek,

262
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,510
and I won't let anything happen to him.

263
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,081
- He's under my protection, so... 
 - I can't trust you.

264
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,829
Han Hye Ryul,

265
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,281
you're swayed.

266
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:09,261
I know you're trying to conceal the real problem

267
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:12,761
by getting on my nerves on purpose.

268
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,724
Although I hate to admit it, you are spiteful and gutsy.

269
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:20,715
But not now,

270
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:24,608
so I will get involved.

271
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,270
I have the right to do so when it comes to Kang Baek.

272
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,950
Submit to it this time. You must.

273
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,085
   

274
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:10,081
 You should've asked your driver to carry it! 

275
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:11,521
It was a hassle.

276
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,321
Did you have dinner?

277
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,421
It's past dinnertime, you see.

278
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:17,391
It feels like you didn't.

279
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,561
You look so frail,

280
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,775
like those dancing balloons.

281
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,130
I'll make myself some ramyeon later.

282
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,215
That will upset Kang Baek.

283
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:33,033
Did he have dinner?

284
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,710
Younger Mi Ja is making

285
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,340
his favorite mozzarella sandwiches right now.

286
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,481
I like sandwiches too.

287
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:44,007
Then take some from your son.

288
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,011
I'll take care of this.

289
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:47,950
Thank you.

290
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,801
If the sandwiches feel too heavy, just have the juice.

291
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:00,071
I added some aloe to help your digestion.

292
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:01,331
Should I bring the food for you?

293
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,981
- No, I've got this. 
 - Okay.

294
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:05,971
Thank you.

295
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,819
Kang Baek.

296
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,106
Kang Baek, are you asleep?

297
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:52,899
Kang Baek.

298
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,255
Kang Baek!

299
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,673
Kang Baek!

300
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:01,305
Kang Baek, open the doors!

301
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:03,215
Kang Baek!

302
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,151
Kang Baek!

303
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,230
Kang Baek!

304
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,987
Kang Baek?

305
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:13,585
Kang Baek!

306
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:17,050
Kang Baek!

307
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,765
What is going on?

308
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,005
Kang Baek.

309
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,221
What's making you so scared and afraid?

310
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,519
I'm sorry, Mom.

311
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,987
What is wrong with me?

312
00:23:48,987 --> 00:23:50,640
I understand.

313
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,768
This can happen.

314
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:55,159
It's okay.

315
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,409
I think I'm going crazy.

316
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:01,291
Let's go.

317
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
Are you feeling better now?

318
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,180
I'm all right now, Mom.

319
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,052
Thanks.

320
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,885
Look.

321
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,601
Kang Baek...

322
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:36,171
can take some time off from school, right?

323
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,430
- Take some time off from school? 
 - Yes.

324
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,571
I'm going to let him write all he wants.

325
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:47,484
If he writes until he's sick of it,

326
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:51,382
he might be able to get back on track.

327
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,089
Your grandpa

328
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:01,171
never condones such weakness.

329
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:05,151
Still, he's struggling too much.

330
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,451
He'll get over it in time,

331
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:12,190
and the girl is dead. It's even more unnecessary.

332
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,590
Mom.

333
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,607
Hye Ryul, snap out of it.

334
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:21,771
You knew he was suffering.

335
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,140
Even I was aware of it.

336
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,445
I bet you knew.

337
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:28,891
You just feigned ignorance.

338
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,865
It was for his sake,

339
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,357
but...

340
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:39,307
- But this is... 
 - I'm doing this for his sake too.

341
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:41,153
If he gives up now,

342
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:44,180
it will only do good for whom we already know.

343
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,055
Hye Ryul.

344
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,446
Look.

345
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,860
Unless we can leave this wealth,

346
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,231
it will all be meaningless.

347
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,747
Our dying effort to protect this

348
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:16,609
will all be meaningless.

349
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:26,315
Let's go upstairs.

350
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:30,173
Today, take some pills and sleep tight.

351
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:41,171
I'm okay now. Thank you, Mom.

352
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:44,480
The pills will work soon, so lie down at ease.

353
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,332
Okay, I will.

354
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,812
Are you okay?

355
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:16,923
Are you worried about me?

356
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,653
Filthy scum.

357
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:25,490
When were you going to tell me?

358
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,518
How were you going to explain?

359
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,361
Did you not even care to think?

360
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,267
Were you just busy satisfying your desire?

361
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,301
Don't look away.

362
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:40,047
Look straight at me.

363
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,180
It must've been fun.

364
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,581
It must've been thrilling and exciting.

365
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,960
That secret affair must've pleased you even more.

366
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,169
I bet you enjoyed it so much.

367
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,720
Honey.

368
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,615
Shut your mouth!

369
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,022
Did you think I was unaware?

370
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:06,027
Did you really think I wouldn't know?

371
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,447
I could smell it so easily.

372
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:12,440
Your lust shouting for joy!

373
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,811
That filthy smell disgusted me.

374
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,881
I felt like throwing up. How was I not supposed to know?

375
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,397
Look at me!

376
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,250
Why did you do it when you can't even look at me?

377
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,091
What were you going to say after all this?

378
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,229
That it was a mistake?

379
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:33,260
This is different from dropping a cup.

380
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,960
Or what? Did love run you over like a car accident?

381
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,820
Was it inevitable?

382
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,631
She was your student.

383
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:45,097
Professor Na, she was your student!

384
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,265
Now how dare you

385
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:49,711
try to run your mouth?

386
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,970
You're despicable.

387
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:55,751
You are a hypocrite.

388
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:58,351
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:01,590
You're sorry for what? Tell me!

390
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,591
Give me an excuse. Explain it!

391
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,690
Persuade me!

392
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,455
I need to understand you to soothe this anger.

393
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:12,831
Why? Did you struggle?

394
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:16,319
Because of me, my mom, or this family?

395
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,700
Did I ignore what you were going through?

396
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,065
Were you the only one suffering? No, you weren't!

397
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:25,361
What about me?

398
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,933
In case you'd suffer...

399
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,567
In case you'd be in too much pain,

400
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:35,337
I anxiously tiptoed around you.

401
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:37,595
I felt sorry.

402
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,031
I struggled in pain with you, you piece of trash!

403
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:49,411
It was hard...

404
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:52,064
and painful for me too.

405
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:58,095
I felt the happiest when you consoled me.

406
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,081
But did you need someone else to console you?

407
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:07,271
That was just lust! Do you hear me?

408
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:11,461
I like what thrills me too, you son of a gun!

409
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,465
I just hold it back!

410
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:18,199
I know what's exciting and fun!

411
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,729
Have you ever

412
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:28,770
imagined me in another man's arms, screaming for joy and satisfaction?

413
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,419
I...

414
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:35,029
I was always in that nightmare.

415
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,543
It wasn't a mistake.

416
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,773
It was...

417
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,508
all my fault.

418
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,684
I couldn't hold myself back.

419
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,305
I was...

420
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:01,227
no better than this.

421
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,480
I'm truly sorry.

422
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,630
I'm expecting to face turmoil

423
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:17,591
regarding the investigation against Jusung.

424
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:19,831
This is really important.

425
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:21,960
If it falls through, I will be doomed.

426
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,650
But...

427
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,924
my Kang Baek...

428
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:32,547
I'm so concerned about him.

429
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,180
I'm scared.

430
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,528
It's driving me crazy.

431
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,438
Don't ever let him find out about this,

432
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,741
and no matter what happens,

433
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,215
protect him.

434
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,530
Promise me.

435
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:11,305
Protect him no matter what.

436
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,237
I will.

437
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,233
I'm busy tomorrow. I need to sleep early.

438
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,350
From now on,

439
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,141
sleep in the reception room.

440
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,327
It's me.

441
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,770
I think the time that you mentioned has come.

442
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:22,080
It's time for us to take what we deserve and pay them back.

443
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
Just as much as they did to us.

444
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,571
I brought the newspaper.

445
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,867
Thank you.

446
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,326
   

447
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:33,789
 I brought the newspaper! 

448
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,475
Yes, come in.

449
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:44,901
Did you sleep well?

450
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,301
Yes, I took some pills last night.

451
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,471
I shouldn't make a habit of this.

452
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:53,071
It's okay, as long as you don't develop a tolerance.

453
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:56,351
This evening, I'll get you some tea that helps sleep.

454
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:58,541
I'd appreciate that.

455
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,181
   

456
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,281
Did Kang Baek read today's newspaper?

457
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:09,991
He hasn't come out of his room yet, so he didn't read the newspaper,

458
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:13,271
but people read articles online these days.

459
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,341
   

460
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,511
They're coming at the case like hyenas.

461
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,210
Look at these titles.

462
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,250
They're fighting to get more views.

463
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,180
They copy and paste the article with a few different words

464
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,120
without checking whether it's true or not,

465
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,690
so they lure people with provocative titles.

466
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,950
They're more like fisherpeople, not reporters.

467
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,360
Are you going somewhere?

468
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,789
I'm going to do what you said no one's interested in.

469
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:55,940
I'm going to bring down those morons.

470
00:35:56,546 --> 00:36:00,051
But you'll be at the team dinner, right?

471
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,281
All right, here.

472
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,015
- Gosh. 
 - Thanks.

473
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:07,711
You must be so blessed, sir.

474
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:10,681
It started raining right when we finished playing!

475
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,181
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

476
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,420
- Nice. 
 - Goodness.

477
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,031
I've been to a lot of renowned golf ranges,

478
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:24,431
but no place is as good as Jusung's.

479
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:25,431
Paegol Beach?

480
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:28,670
It's known to have a nice landscape

481
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,341
but the course itself can't be compared to Jusung's.

482
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:36,810
Maintenance comes first when it comes to golf clubs.

483
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,551
This is all thanks to you two.

484
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,951
Who knew there would be something stronger than Dolphin and Jusung?

485
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,321
Other issues have gone out of the window.

486
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:55,560
With this murder case, the whole country is busy looking for the culprit.

487
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,531
It's not just a murder case.

488
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,471
A beautiful law school student

489
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,971
who looked glamorous, unlike her poor background.

490
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:06,770
Regardless of how it's titled, people will find it sensational.

491
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,410
Come to think of it, she was your student.

492
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,781
Didn't she have any man problems?

493
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:15,881
People are talking about it everywhere, including the Internet.

494
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:20,491
Murder is often caused by money, grudges, or love affairs.

495
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:24,690
She used to be so conceited and proud.

496
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,960
Hardly anything worked on her.

497
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,497
Oh, really?

498
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,831
I guess she rejected him.

499
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:36,201
Oh, please. She was a student. How inappropriate of you, sir.

500
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:38,924
- Goodness. 
 - Come on.

501
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,210
Oh, really.

502
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,675
Nan Hee was...

503
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:50,188
I mean, the dead student.

504
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:52,389
She was probably going out with Kang Baek,

505
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:55,091
Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul's son.

506
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,969
The body shows lacerations, a skull fracture,

507
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:05,268
hypodermic bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and others.

508
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:07,998
The back of her right head was stricken hard with a weapon,

509
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:10,038
which caused arteriorrhexis.

510
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,909
Did you find her bloodstains near the lake?

511
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:12,580
That must be

512
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,270
where she was attacked.

513
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,348
As for the weapon,

514
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:19,918
could it be the iron pipe that we sent you last time?

515
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,889
Oh, the one you found in the lake?

516
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:25,158
Yes, he dived in himself to find it.

517
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:27,518
Considering the shapes of her lacerations and fracture,

518
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:31,929
it's highly likely that a similar iron pipe was used.

519
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,998
Because it was submerged,

520
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:36,868
you wouldn't be able to find any of her bloodstains on it,

521
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:38,538
not to mention her fingerprints.

522
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:43,668
It's an ordinary iron pipe, so it may be irrelevant to the case.

523
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:49,309
In any case, the victim was killed with an iron pipe. Is that correct?

524
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,309
It's true she was attacked with an iron pipe,

525
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:55,272
but the direct cause was drowning.

526
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,149
During the autopsy, I saw her lungs swollen with water,

527
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,989
and planktons were found in the tissues of her body.

528
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,589
But because of the arteriorrhexis,

529
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:07,209
the victim would've died even if she had been left alone.

530
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,139
But this is such a strange case.

531
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,961
In what way?

532
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:24,779
Considering the bleeding amount and bloodstains, I can't be so sure,

533
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,779
but it seems like she was drowned a while after the attack.

534
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:30,149
Let alone that,

535
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,358
do you see this scar on her forehead?

536
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,939
A piece of wood was found in it.

537
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,659
What? A piece of wood? I don't understand.

538
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,299
If a piece of wood is found in a straight laceration like this,

539
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,969
it means bumping against furniture.

540
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:46,069
So I can assume she got this wound by bumping against furniture,

541
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,887
and that the piece of wood got stuck in it.

542
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:54,691
But there were no wooden structures near the scene, right?

543
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:55,879
Yes, that's correct.

544
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,409
Then I guess she got the wound

545
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:00,748
by something that happened indoors, where there were furniture pieces.

546
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:04,759
So you believe that this wound has nothing to do with the murder?

547
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:09,259
That's right, but it doesn't look like it was treated at all.

548
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,798
I mean, she didn't have to go into the ER to get it stitched,

549
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:15,728
but she should've disinfected it and put a bandage on it at least.

550
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:18,968
Other than that, there aren't many clues left.

551
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,299
Most evidence was damaged or washed away by the water.

552
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:23,109
Also,

553
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:28,609
no foreign DNA was found under the fingernails or inside the body.

554
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:33,399
Doctor, if she drowned,

555
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:38,022
do you think the victim suffered a lot of pain?

556
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:40,918
 The bereaved often ask me about that. 

557
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:43,129
 However, the arteriorrhexis was quite severe, 

558
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:46,058
 so it's highly likely that she was unconscious at the time. 

559
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:49,998
 If she was indeed unconscious, she probably didn't feel any pain, 

560
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:52,820
 but I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. 

561
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,609
She was going to die anyway,

562
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,223
so why was she thrown into the lake?

563
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:03,779
And on top of that, what's with the time gap?

564
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:06,230
Is that what you're most curious about?

565
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:10,478
I want to know where she got the wound on her forehead.

566
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:11,490
Her forehead?

567
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,489
She was hit with a blunt weapon and was thrown into the lake,

568
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:17,229
but hurt her forehead somewhere indoors. Her movements don't make sense.

569
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:18,958
Movements?

570
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,359
She was supposed to meet with the reporter at 11p.m.,

571
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,998
but left her dorm room way before that, at 9:30 p.m.

572
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:28,239
They were supposed to meet on campus. It takes less than 20 minutes to get there.

573
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,179
It means she had something else to do before meeting the reporter.

574
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,148
And she hurt her forehead while taking care of that?

575
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:37,588
That is the only plausible explanation,

576
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:41,489
and the location where she was found too.

577
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,907
What about it?

578
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:48,228
She was supposed to meet with the reporter over there,

579
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:51,121
and the dormitory is over there.

580
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:53,408
She didn't have to pass the lake.

581
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:55,406
Then where did she go?

582
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:56,969
We combed through all the security footage,

583
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:00,639
and confirmed that the victim did not leave the campus that night.

584
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,535
So whatever happened must've taken place inside the campus.

585
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:08,978
Oh, hello. We just got here too.

586
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,448
It was her, right?

587
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:13,772
- What? 
 - Hong Nan Hee was the informant.

588
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,018
Yes, that's right.

589
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:16,688
Why are you still here?

590
00:42:16,688 --> 00:42:18,558
She was killed trying to tip off.

591
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:21,688
You must find out who wanted to silence her and why!

592
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:23,389
Reporter Yoon, please calm down.

593
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,659
If you have time for this, go investigate Ham &amp; Lee and Jusung.

594
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:29,228
You're leaking information about the investigation. What is this?

595
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,569
Hey, Yoon Eun Mi!

596
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:36,790
Everyone is busy running their mouth when they know nothing.

597
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:42,208
She was not that kind of person. I assure you!

598
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,148
You see, this could get you into trouble.

599
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:46,018
It is fishy. I know that too,

600
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:49,818
but there's nothing I can do based on my speculation alone!

601
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,559
If you keep this up, the real culprit will hide,

602
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,699
and an innocent person will fall under suspicion.

603
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,498
You know, everyone has a secret.

604
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:02,258
Not everyone with a hammer is looking for a nail to hit.

605
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:06,269
We're going to interview the victim's friends later today.

606
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:10,798
They're well-versed in the law and will take a strong stance against the media,

607
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:13,149
so don't worry too much.

608
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:14,579
You'll tell me whatever you find out, right?

609
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,948
Yes, as long as I don't overstep my bounds.

610
00:43:16,948 --> 00:43:19,248
Don't worry too much.

611
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:26,059
My gosh. Someone killed her and dumped her body in the lake.

612
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:27,488
It's so scary.

613
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:30,059
Whoever did it must be a psychopath.

614
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:35,198
I mean, why else would someone want to kill a person and advertise it?

615
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:40,598
Guys, maybe the killer is watching us, getting a kick out of our reaction.

616
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,838
It was likely done on the spur of the moment or caused by negligence.

617
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,709
Premeditated murders aren't common.

618
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:48,849
Hey, no.

619
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:52,148
The lake is far from here, but we can see it when the sun comes up.

620
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:54,148
It was clearly premeditated.

621
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,849
Maybe the killer wanted to show someone... No.

622
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:59,858
Did the killer want to send some kind of message to the whole nation?

623
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:02,659
Hey, what if this is a serial murder case?

624
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:06,029
Hey, stop watching YouTube videos about bizarre conspiracy theories.

625
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:09,398
Well, psychopaths aren't the only ones that commit murders.

626
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,758
It could've been a crime of passion.

627
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:14,199
- You know, Nan Hee was... 
 - What?

628
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,969
Well, wasn't it obvious to everyone?

629
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:18,709
What was obvious?

630
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:21,438
Nan Hee and Kang Baek were seeing each other.

631
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,830
Why are you bringing up Kang Baek now?

632
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,809
Watch what you say!

633
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:29,918
Your statement is false, so this is considered slander.

634
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:33,118
You all want to take the bar exam, don't you?

635
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:35,364
Hey, aren't you embarrassed?

636
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:39,825
Do you really want to speak of your dead classmate in that manner?

637
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:44,832
Gosh, I only stated a fact. Look at you ganging up on me.

638
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:48,839
Kang Baek kept visiting Nan Hee's dorm room!

639
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,063
So what?

640
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,809
What's the big deal about it?

641
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:56,309
Just so you know, I use that room too.

642
00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:00,219
It's my room too. Nan Hee wasn't the only one who used that room.

643
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:01,991
Hold on.

644
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:07,689
Did anyone here not know that something was going on between Kang Baek and Nan Hee?

645
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:10,819
Answer my question! Did anyone here not know?

646
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:12,371
Hey, you.

647
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:15,469
You also thought something was definitely going on. Say something.

648
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:18,979
- Hey, stop. 
 - What a moron.

649
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:23,813
- What did you say? 
 - I said, "What a moron."

650
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:25,409
I know Kang Baek better than anybody else does.

651
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:27,509
Who are you to run your mouth like that?

652
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:29,009
Moron?

653
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:32,668
Who am I to run my mouth like this?

654
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:36,318
Hey, Jang Ji Yi.

655
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,088
I'm four years older than you. Have you forgotten?

656
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:41,059
Then act your age.

657
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:43,459
I got into law school as soon as I graduated,

658
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:45,699
yet you took four years just to get in.

659
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:48,929
Why talk such nonsense about Kang Baek and Nan Hee

660
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,969
and get bashed by someone who is four years younger than you?

661
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:53,183
You little...

662
00:45:58,368 --> 00:46:00,477
Please!

663
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:12,619
Let me study.

664
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,367
Will you?

665
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:26,283
She is causing trouble even after she died.

666
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,911
Hello, excuse me.

667
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:43,748
We're here to investigate the Hong Nan Hee case.

668
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:46,741
You all have a moment to spare, right?

669
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:51,889
I'm sorry, but the exams are just around the corner and we don't really know anything.

670
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,863
But your friend died...

671
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:57,628
She was our classmate. It doesn't mean we were friends.

672
00:46:57,628 --> 00:47:00,338
I'm not sure if I can be of any help but you can ask me,

673
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:03,139
although I already told you everything I know.

674
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:06,700
Yesterday, I asked you about...

675
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,500
There's...

676
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:21,688
There's someone I'm suspecting.

677
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:38,243
Well... That day, I...

678
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,519
Don't worry. He won't say anything about you.

679
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,631
Still...

680
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:01,353
Kyung Yoon can't really say anything about that day.

681
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:07,924
We were...

682
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:17,248
 I told you to keep a close watch on the whistleblower. 

683
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:19,679
What will you do if we can't get the statement?

684
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,749
They were sure about it up until last week, but they suddenly—

685
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,357
Last week?

686
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:27,129
Then you should've wrapped it up last week!

687
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:31,648
I'm sorry. It was— 
 - Don't even try to list excuses.

688
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:35,329
Hey, just quit being a prosecutor if you're going to keep this up.

689
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,128
I'll try to persuade them again.

690
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:39,039
That's not good enough!

691
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,419
Persuade them no matter what and get their statement!

692
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,175
Yes, ma'am.

693
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:48,838
Get out. Why are you standing there?

694
00:48:49,478 --> 00:48:51,363
Senior.

695
00:48:52,518 --> 00:48:56,530
You know, you let me borrow this thing the other day.

696
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,619
 I transferred all the files to the USB flash drive, just in case, 

697
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:03,399
 to be prepared for anything. 

698
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,359
   

699
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:08,163
 Ms. Han, CEO Hong Tae Hoon of Hongyeon Engineering. 

700
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:10,759
 You still don't get it, do you? 

701
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,199
You can keep it.

702
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,481
No, it's not that.

703
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,414
It had less storage space than I'd thought.

704
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,865
I thought it was odd, so I looked into it.

705
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:27,115
Turns out, there's a hacking program installed on this thing.

706
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:29,889
What?

707
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:33,805
You said you got this from the student who interned here.

708
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:38,920
The one who died, Hong Nan Hee. Right?

709
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:55,336
   

710
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:01,616
   

711
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:18,437
- Did you have fun? 
 - Of course.

712
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:34,598
Jang Il.

713
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:37,418
What brings you here at this hour?

714
00:50:37,418 --> 00:50:40,122
Because I couldn't reach you.

715
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,019
Let's grab a drink.

716
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:51,058
How's Ji Yi?

717
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:54,364
She must be busy studying.

718
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:55,809
Don't get me started.

719
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,779
She says she's studying and comes home late every night.

720
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:01,555
I feel bad for her.

721
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:07,249
It feels like just yesterday when she called me "Unkle" because she couldn't say "Uncle" properly.

722
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:09,787
Time flies.

723
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:13,788
Are you really going to make her a prosecutor?

724
00:51:13,788 --> 00:51:15,744
Who knows?

725
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:20,961
She wants to be but she's too tender-hearted,

726
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:25,911
but I'm sure you're not here to ask that.

727
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:27,268
What is it?

728
00:51:27,268 --> 00:51:32,196
Why did you come to see me when we meet every day?

729
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:39,297
Can I say we share a common destiny?

730
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,875
- What? 
 - I heard you're getting nominated.

731
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,948
Whether it's the Parliament or the Blue House, you said you'd take me with you.

732
00:51:46,948 --> 00:51:49,289
I lost Han Hye Ryul's favor because I got involved with you.

733
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,309
I'm labeled as the government-patronized prosecutor.

734
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:58,929
When I look at the situation, I'll end up in prison before I get the gold badge.

735
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:02,998
Weren't you ready for it before you jumped into politics?

736
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:06,779
It's do-or-die.

737
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:11,773
Every moment is sink or swim.

738
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,427
Jang Il,

739
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:18,689
even if you go down,

740
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:23,767
a reliable fence will make you feel secure.

741
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,011
I think now is the time.

742
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,905
It's the right time.

743
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:34,801
Let's get Ji Yi married.

744
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:47,152
You should leave. It's late.

745
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:51,603
Besides Ji Yi is crazy about Kang Baek.

746
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:55,010
I'll talk sense into her.

747
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,458
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

748
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:00,431
It was what you wanted.

749
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,118
What about you?

750
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:04,728
Why are you pushing it?

751
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:05,699
What about me?

752
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:10,409
Kang Baek and Hong Nan Hee were in a relationship.

753
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,708
The country is investigating her murder.

754
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:21,580
Whose name do you think will be mentioned?

755
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:26,489
Jang Il.

756
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:29,685
How can you say that?

757
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:33,458
I heard that rumor too, that they dated,

758
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,302
but that's not confirmed.

759
00:53:36,302 --> 00:53:40,001
Besides, do you really think Kang Baek did that?

760
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:41,911
Is that it?

761
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:44,068
It's Kang Baek!

762
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:47,701
You're a prosecutor. You know it.

763
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:51,949
How women normally get killed.

764
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,349
How can you say that?

765
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:54,478
And you?

766
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,982
How can you say that?

767
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,128
Since when did you like my Ji Yi so much?

768
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:07,445
The right time? Timing?

769
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:10,582
Do I look like a joke to you, you prick?

770
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:12,975
Do I?

771
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:15,533
What do you take my daughter for?

772
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:19,180
Get out. Get out of my house.

773
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,631
Never show your face to me again,

774
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,053
or I'm going to kill you.

775
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:29,931
Jang Il,

776
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:33,187
Kang Baek didn't do it,

777
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:36,305
but what about Ji Yi?

778
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:39,673
Ji Yi did it.

779
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:45,332
I haven't told anyone yet,

780
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:48,744
not even to Han Hye Ryul or Kang Baek.

781
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,597
But now you're talking like Kang Baek has a flaw.

782
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,795
That upsets me.

783
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:12,493
- Won Kyung. That's— 
 - Jang Il.

784
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:14,958
Right now is the right time.

785
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,223
After this,

786
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:24,338
not only just Ham &amp; Lee, but she won't be able to marry anyone.

787
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:29,062
Think about what's best for Ji Yi.

788
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,739
Even if her father is a chief prosecutor,

789
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:37,719
who would want a drug addict as their daughter-in-law?

790
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:20,858
Thank you for your work. You may go home.

791
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:23,667
Yes. Have a good night.

792
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:48,889
 You know, you let me borrow this thing the other day. 

793
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:52,375
 I thought it was odd, so I looked into it. 

794
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:56,943
 Turns out, there's a hacking program installed on this thing. 

795
00:56:56,943 --> 00:57:00,781
 You said you got this from Hong Nan Hee, didn't you? 

796
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:04,941
What do you know?

797
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:08,418
What do you have?

798
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:12,708
I don't know what you're saying.

799
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:19,942
How about this?

800
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:22,613
Were you on her side?

801
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:28,159
What were you two after?

802
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:31,041
You even hurt Kang Baek.

803
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,359
You jerk.

804
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:47,060
 This isn't what you wanted? 

805
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,519
 What's that supposed to mean? 

806
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:54,520
 No. Whatever. 

807
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,983
 You don't need to answer me. 

808
00:57:57,629 --> 00:58:02,063
 Can you just stop it now? 

809
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,869
 Please. 

810
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:07,103
 Please! 

811
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:17,067
 If I stop here, I'll die. 

812
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,289
 Then die. 

813
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:25,608
 Die! 

814
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,450



815
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,490
♫  Take off the mask  ♫

816

817
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:58,600
♫  Why are you trying to hide it?  ♫

818
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,650
♫  Sing out your voice as sharp as an awl  ♫

819
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:09,970
♫  Reveal yourself  ♫

820
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:16,720
♫  Get out into the world  ♫

821
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:23,490
♫  Why do you want to hide?  ♫

822
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,540
♫  Tell me why  ♫

823
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,088
 Kang Baek is a murderer? 

824
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:33,018
 Anyone can be a murderer. 

825
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:35,458
 Whose name did you give the detective as a culprit? 

826
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,759
 It's not you? Where were you that night? 

827
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:40,159
 After today, don't bring up Kang Baek's name. 

828
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,628
 I'm marrying him! 

829
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:43,969
 Protecting Kang Baek is our highest priority. 

830
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:46,969
 Is it you? The person who killed Hong Nan Hee? 

831
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:48,168
 Isn't the answer obvious? 

832
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:53,029
 Hire someone who can even kill people on my behalf. 

833
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:55,710
 Please... Don't kill me. 

834
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,540
 I killed Nan Hee! 

835
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,400
♫   Sometimes beyond my control   ♫
