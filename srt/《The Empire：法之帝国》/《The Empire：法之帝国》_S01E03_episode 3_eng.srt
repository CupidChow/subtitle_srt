1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,780



2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,321
   

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,671
Don't answer it.

4
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,211
Sorry, it's an internal phone call.

5
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,971
I'm telling you to not answer it.

6
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:41,981
People might show up at my office if I don't answer.

7
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,136
Let them.

8
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,300
Give me a second.

9
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,342
Yes, this is Na Geun Woo.

10
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,305
 Yes, I know. 

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,481
Yes, Mother. I mean, Director Ham.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,601
Are you alone?

13
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,720
Yes, I'm alone.

14
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,670
I have new guidelines for your lectures.

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,890
 Since I'm on my way out, I'll bring them to you now. 

16
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,810
Right now?

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,710
 Why are you so surprised? 

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,951
 Is there a reason I shouldn't be at your office? 

19
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,581
No. I'm not surprised.

20
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:25,590
I can go to your office, but you offered to come here.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,851
Okay.

22
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:44,314
   

23
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,780
Hey, you have to leave right now.

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,392
What do we do with this?

25
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:51,850
Do you want to stop here?

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,481
Nan Hee, let's talk later. We can talk about this another time.

27
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,051
What should we do with your clothes?

28
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:57,851
Get a hotel room tonight.

29
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,899
Nan Hee.

30
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,851
I won't leave unless you answer me.

31
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,970
Please, stop goofing around!

32
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:22,364
Nan Hee, please do something about your clothes first!

33
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,640
Get a hotel room.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,340
Okay.

35
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,525
See you later.

36
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,220
You're here.

37
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,180
   

38
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,941
You've been coming home late quite often these days.

39
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,194
Am I giving you too much work?

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:00,658
No. It's just that I've been falling behind on work these days.

41
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,410
Is that so?

42
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,491
You should call it a day. Let's go home together.

43
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,400
I have some work left. I'll be home after I finish.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,821
How much time will it take?

45
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:28,149
It will take some time. I'll be working until dawn.

46
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,747
I see.

47
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:36,580
Goodnight.

48
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,731
But make sure to finish it before coming home.

49
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:51,345
Don't drag it into our house and make a mess.

50
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:15,950
   

51
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,410
Come on. What is this?

52
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,910
Oh my.

53
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,679
How could anyone park like that? Come on.

54
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,011
What... Oh goodness!

55
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,180
Gosh. Hello, there.

56
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,464
What?

57
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,920
Darn it, you scared me! Goodness.

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,761
Gosh. You've been pushing papers at the Intelligence Division.

59
00:05:56,761 --> 00:06:00,921
Look at you. You turned into a coward.

60
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,282
Hey, what are you doing?

61
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:06,001
I hear you guys spy on each other at the Intelligence Division.

62
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:09,771
That's because people are trying to dig out information from us,

63
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,040
so they are watching us.

64
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,670
I'm one of them.

65
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,390
I'm here to dig out information.

66
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,081
What?

67
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,817
Han Hye Ryul.

68
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:23,091
Senior Prosecutor at Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

69
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,240
You've been digging into her, right?

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,620
Why do you want information on her?

71
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,585
Give me something good about her.

72
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,367
So you can investigate Christmas Fund?

73
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:39,080
How do you know about that?

74
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,670
How do I know?

75
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,835
Because Han Hye Ryul has been investigating VIP's circle.

76
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:49,507
People connected to Christmas Fund.

77
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,990
I'll take responsibility for it. Push the Christmas Fund case.

78
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,620
No one is above the law.

79
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,089
Investigate everyone, even the VIPs.

80
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,361
So you have an exclusive report to give to us today.

81
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,561
You had reliable information. Correct?

82
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,901
Yes, that's right.

83
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,930
A board member of Christmas Fund

84
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,271
instructed someone to talk to the press and the prosecution

85
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,927
in the recording file I obtained.

86
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,240
The board member bribed someone from the Blue House

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,681
and asked to favor Jusung according to the recording file.

88
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,450
The recording file confirmed that the board member had received

89
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,821
a huge sum of money from Jusung and banks.

90
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,280
 The public believed it was a good investment 

91
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,381
 and put their precious savings in this fund, 

92
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,350
 so they're facing a lot of damage. 

93
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,521
 What on earth have the FSS and the prosecution been doing all this time? 

94
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,661
-  That's the biggest problem.  
 - Hey.

95
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:42,429
Were you behind this?

96
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,493
Was it you again?

97
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,601
You must have lost your mind.

98
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,341
Are you handing over your case files to the press now?

99
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,870
Why don't you set up a camera for a live broadcast in your office?

100
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,410
No. You know what? You're better off live-streaming.

101
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,640
"This is what I did today, and I'm doing this today."

102
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,100
"Here's what I'll do tomorrow."

103
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,396
Hey, get this. The tip came from the Special Department.

104
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,281
When did you have the time to investigate  Christmas Fund?

105
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:14,121
You're challenging me, aren't you?

106
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,100
This is a targeted investigation.

107
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,140
I should report you for violating the guidelines.

108
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,000
How dare you conduct an investigation with a target?

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,920
You're a mere senior prosecutor!

110
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm investigating Christmas Fund because it's connected to Jusung,

111
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,481
and I didn't leak it to the press.

112
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,951
Are you telling me I did it?

113
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,951
I'm certain that the board member in question is Dolphin for sure,

114
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:38,291
but I haven't even listened to that recording yet!

115
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,091
You treated him to some Chinese liquor in your office,

116
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,791
but you failed to get some intel. You shouldn't say that out so loud.

117
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,539
What?

118
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,091
Are you seriously provoking me right now?

119
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,575
Darn it!

120
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:53,385
Do I have to watch a divorced couple argue now?

121
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:58,251
Han Hye Ryul, I'll make you pay for this.

122
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,860
Do you think you have the world at your feet?

123
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,324
You just watch.

124
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,370
Was it you?

125
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,441
Pardon?

126
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:33,041
That did come from our case file. Did you leak it?

127
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,510
No.

128
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,395
Prosecutor Oh,

129
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:40,985
I can't go out on a limb for you if I can't trust you.

130
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,998
Well,

131
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,735
the thing is,

132
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,220
I heard that the Intelligence Division of the Police Agency was doing an internal investigation on you.

133
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,331
I didn't want anything to happen to you.

134
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:59,051
I had to tell them something to get information.

135
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,569
I'm really sorry.

136
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:09,241
Hey, are you my brother or dad?

137
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,951
Even if you were my brother or dad, you shouldn't have done that.

138
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,050
Even if you were my husband, you had no right.

139
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,991
Everyone has their own part to play.

140
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:20,321
There are things you can't do for other people.

141
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,790
When I decided to follow your lead,

142
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,630
I was determined to risk everything I had.

143
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,931
Right. We might lose everything we have.

144
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,360
I appreciate that like crazy,

145
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,900
but only you can walk that path.

146
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,980
Do you know what that means?

147
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,671
I may be so grateful that you jumped in

148
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,441
but I can't walk that path for your sake, which I feel really awful about.

149
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:43,738
So leave it to me to walk my path.

150
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:46,851
But Hye Ryul, it's easier said than done.

151
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:49,507
Nothing is easy in life.

152
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:53,364
Let's be more careful, so this doesn't happen again.

153
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,431
And...

154
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:02,330
it's a bit uncomfortable for me to bring this up

155
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,100
because it feels like I'm intervening in your personal life.

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,956
That reporter. She's charming.

157
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:12,611
She's cute, smart, and passionate about her work.

158
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,731
She's an ambitious one too,

159
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:18,532
so she gets on my nerves a lot.

160
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:22,751
Prosecutor Oh, I trust that you can separate pleasure from work.

161
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,408
 Seong Hyun, I'm so disappointed. 

162
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,700
 It's been a month. 

163
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,941
 How is this possible? 

164
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:43,700
 Are you the only prosecutor at your branch? 

165
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,229
 I'm a busy woman too, you know? 

166
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:50,071
 Gosh. I know that you're busy, Eun Mi. 

167
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,311
 I'm sorry. 

168
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,919
 Is it because of Christmas Fund? 

169
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,921
 - What are you talking about? 
 - You heard me. 

170
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:01,681
 Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul is digging Christmas Fund. 

171
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,480
 Who told you that? 

172
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,631
 There's a detective going after Christmas Fund with laser focus. 

173
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,151
 A mere detective is digging the Christmas Fund case? 

174
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,460
 I thought even a mere prosecutor couldn't get to the bottom of it. 

175
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,141
 She's not just a mere prosecutor. 

176
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,201
 So she's different? 

177
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,051
 Hey, I'm sorry. 

178
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:28,951
 I have a report I haven't submitted yet. 

179
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,250
 I have to go. 

180
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,770
 There's an internal investigation 

181
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,911
 on Senior Prosecutor Han. It's from the Intelligence Division. 

182
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,185
 They're digging into her. 

183
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,375
 They must want to nip her in the bud. 

184
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,700
 Are you sure? 

185
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,100
 They are the most concerned that she's being discussed as a presidential candidate. 

186
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,980
 She's not like Na Geun Woo. 

187
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,950
 She's still a prosecutor. She has got the authority. 

188
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,220
 She's even willing to prosecute her in-laws. 

189
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,520
 It wouldn't stop her from going after politicians. 

190
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,291
 They can try all they want, but they won't find anything on her. 

191
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,494
 I know that for sure. 

192
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,230
 She's the cleanest prosecutor. 

193
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,150
 Do you really believe that? 

194
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,730
 Then what about Ham &amp; Lee law corporation? 

195
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,901
 They've got more problems than they can handle. 

196
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:23,240
 Being surrounded by minefields means she's standing on one. 

197
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,571
 Why are you following her lead? There's so much that can blow up in her face. 

198
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,581
 Seong Hyun. 

199
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,124
 I'm worried about you. 

200
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:36,875
 I'm happy that you want to follow a great prosecutor, 

201
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:42,249
 but things have changed. It's a different ball game now. 

202
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,880
 Don't you know how scary those politicians are? 

203
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,211
 This will only end when one of them is done for. 

204
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,031
 Let's be honest. She's got everything she needs, 

205
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,560
 but... 

206
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,430
 what about you? 

207
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,641
 Prosecutor Oh, 

208
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,981
 I trust that you can separate pleasure from work. 

209
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,254
Gosh. It's so dry.

210
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,021
Seriously. We should have gotten cup noodles.

211
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:21,161
The hot broth will steam up the glass.

212
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,161
Are you trying to tell the world that we're on a stakeout here?

213
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:28,349
Having brothy food on a stakeout is a bit iffy,

214
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:31,341
or you should go out and have decent food. We'll wait here.

215
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:34,011
"Go out and have decent food. We'll wait here."

216
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:36,210
Do you think we're tour guides?

217
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,911
Why did you let her tag along, to begin with?

218
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,620
I can't let her wait outside on this cold day. She goes on TV.

219
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,213
I don't want you to catch a cold.

220
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:47,144
Fine. I don't want cup noodles. Okay?

221
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,894
I'm good.

222
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,458
I have a missed call.

223
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,274
Don't talk. I have to make this call.

224
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,804
Sweetie!

225
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,894
I didn't know you called.

226
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,710
You didn't tell me you would put it on the news like that.

227
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,340
No, I'm not in trouble.

228
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,311
She's in a tight spot now.

229
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,811
We have no definitive proof or any confessions yet.

230
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,151
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

231
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,280
there will be roadblocks for us.

232
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
 Sweetie, 

233
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,711
do you know how hard I thought about this?

234
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:26,191
This was the best scenario for you and Senior Prosecutor Han.

235
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,490
She needs to show people what she can do. That way, they can't come after her.

236
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,431
You guys are already going for it.

237
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,131
If you guys don't show it, people can come after you.

238
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,571
Sweetie,

239
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:39,310
did you think I would do something that could hurt your career?

240
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,847
Did you?

241
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,011
I'll keep checking on this.

242
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,511
Just give me information on Dolphin.

243
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,821
If you decide to go with Senior Prosecutor Han,

244
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:54,220
I'll root for you. That's a no-brainer.

245
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,691
Don't think about anything else. Just go home and get some sleep.

246
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,615
I'll call you again.

247
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:00,530
Okay.

248
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,791
I love you!

249
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,431
Senior, you've never seen a girl in a relationship before?

250
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:10,240
Relationship, my foot! You're totally using him.

251
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,441
Hold on a second, I should check your record.

252
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,741
This isn't your first time. You've done this before.

253
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,941
So what? Should I give up on getting intel on Dolphin?

254
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,700
Now, you're threatening me.

255
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,904
Your rap sheet seems to be quite complicated.

256
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,603
Aren't you hungry?

257
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,961
You must have been shaken up.

258
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,845
Did you watch the news?

259
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,664
Things are pretty bad, right?

260
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:10,731
The information leak was quite sloppy.

261
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:15,771
Now that the Blue House is mentioned, those in the power circle must have been shocked.

262
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,421
They will counteract now that they've seen your hand.

263
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,540
I wonder what they'll do.

264
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,411
They won't have a lot of options,

265
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,415
but among them,

266
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:30,049
they will find an option that can hurt us both.

267
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,690
Us both...

268
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:36,905
We're getting on their nerves.

269
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,691
We're too perfect.

270
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,730
Don't you agree?

271
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,310
   

272
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,881
All right. We're at your favorite tteokbokki  (spicey stir-fried rice cakes)  restaurant.

273
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,050
Let's think after we have had some food.

274
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,259
Let's get fritters and sundae. My treat!

275
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,160
What? Do you need more food?

276
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,017
Fishcakes too?

277
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,460
Honey, what about desserts?

278
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,670
Of course, we must have ice cream after tteokbokki.

279
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,827
Gosh. You're going to empty my wallet today.

280
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,200
All right.

281
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,121
   

282
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,927
Thank you.

283
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:46,691
Professor Na, I'm a huge fan! Can I get a photo with you?

284
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:47,891
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

285
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,271
Can you take a photo for me?

286
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,231
Okay.

287
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,350
Isn't it good?

288
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,380
It hasn't changed.

289
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,359
It's tasty.

290
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,290
Na Geun Woo.

291
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,880
No way!

292
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,161
   

293
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,780
   

294
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,480
   

295
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,821
   

296
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,481
What are you reading?

297
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,705
I really don't think this is right.

298
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,464
Nan Hee,

299
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,343
this is wrong.

300
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,021
Na Geun Woo?

301
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:21,921
He may look cool, but you can't do that to Kang Baek.

302
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,425
Not to a friend.

303
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,781
Maybe I shouldn't have told you this.

304
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,661
Forget what I showed you before.

305
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,549
How can I?

306
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,101
What you're doing is wrecking a family,

307
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,601
and what if the rumor spreads?

308
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:41,170
You'll suffer the most. You know that.

309
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,411
Na Geun Woo is a man,

310
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,881
so people might say he mistakenly got tempted by a female student,

311
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:46,864
but what about you?

312
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:48,901
What will you do?

313
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:52,431
Don't you want to become a prosecutor?

314
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,821
Ah Jeong.

315
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,964
You can easily find a decent guy.

316
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,331
Oh Seok Hoon, the hospital director's son.

317
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:02,630
I heard he had a crush on you.

318
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:03,800
Ji Eui Seong too.

319
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,070
The son of Law Firm Seungri's CEO. You know him, right?

320
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,543
I mean,

321
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,354
whoever you date,

322
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,925
it's better than dating your college friend's dad.

323
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,340
Ah Jeong,

324
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,281
you see,

325
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,213
I need Professor Na.

326
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,421
You need him?

327
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,320
Nan Hee, you...

328
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,701
Are you receiving

329
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,535
money from him or something?

330
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,755
Well...

331
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,141
Look. If it's urgent,

332
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,841
I'll get a credit line if I must lend you the money.

333
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:53,625
So stop this

334
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,450
before you get into serious trouble.

335
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,680
Or will you ruin your life for a few bucks even before you got to spread your wings?

336
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,390
It's not just about a few bucks.

337
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,847
Then just how much is it?

338
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,151
It's not about money.

339
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,050
I was keeping it from you in case you'd face harm for nothing,

340
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,150
but I guess I should explain.

341
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,910
Instead, don't get involved no matter what happens.

342
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,247
I'll take care of it all.

343
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,009
Pretend you don't know anything.

344
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,024
Okay?

345
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:29,080
Hey.

346
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,821
You're scaring me.

347
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:32,857
Promise me.

348
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,257
Okay.

349
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,221
It's a long story to tell.

350
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,805
 If you look over there... Let me show you around. 

351
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,091
 Hello. 

352
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:14,165
 Why I need Na Geun Woo. 

353
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,805
 Why I must jump into that pit of fire. 

354
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:26,550
 Why I can never forgive. 

355
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:40,464
Gosh, it doesn't taste good.

356
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:48,060
Ms. Yang, please take the dishes away.

357
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,540
 Are you done eating already? 

358
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,240
You heard me.

359
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,171
 Yes, ma'am. 

360
00:23:56,301 --> 00:24:00,408
I ended up eating more because of them.

361
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:03,854
I already had 1,100 calories today!

362
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:06,206
Oh, my!

363
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:10,527
What... Come in!

364
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,960
Hey, hurry! Clean this up

365
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,653
and change the bedding.

366
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,831
I suddenly craved tteokbokki because of these kids,

367
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,971
but it wasn't as good when I actually had it.

368
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:31,631
By the way, if they put up a show with such an article in mind,

369
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:34,171
I must say they're impressive.

370
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:38,061
They're like celebrities being followed by the paparazzi.

371
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,531
Why won't you answer me?

372
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,780
You must find me easy to deal with.

373
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,920
Yes, that's right.

374
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,021
The others tiptoe around me and fake how they treat me

375
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,821
because my husband and their interests are on the line,

376
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:54,460
but you look down on me out in the face.

377
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,831
That's why I find you easy.

378
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:57,831
I don't have to fake my behavior either.

379
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,398
I'm trying my best,

380
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:03,341
but I guess it shows.

381
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,541
It shows so much that it's very offensive.

382
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,041
I'm worried you might end up feeling attached to me

383
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:11,148
while treating me at ease.

384
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:13,650
Go ahead and act up as much as you want.

385
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,880
Let's wait and see how long it will last.

386
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,604
Older Mi Ja and Younger Mi Ja will have to come up for the bedding.

387
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,679
Tidy yourself to act a bit coy.

388
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,231
You're so annoying!

389
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,335
Hello?

390
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,771
It's me. Just when will you come?

391
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,600
I know I shouldn't call you, but you have to understand me.

392
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:08,300
I can't stand it anymore.

393
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,471
It feels like a prison. No, even worse than that.

394
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:14,451
I know how it is to be in prison, and this is definitely worse.

395
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,510
I understand.

396
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:26,121
Okay.

397
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,950
Yes.

398
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,375
Hurry here.

399
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:15,716
Well...

400
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,610
Hello?

401
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,018
Oh, hello. How have you been?

402
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,795
It's always the same for me.

403
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:36,190
I'm sorry that I call you only when I need your help.

404
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,721
This time, I'm calling to inquire

405
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,930
about the Sentencing Commission's revision plan

406
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,631
to extend the limit and increase the sentence

407
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,671
regarding the industrial safety and health act's violation.

408
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:48,301
Excuse me. Someone's here.

409
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,684
Come in!

410
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,610
Sorry about that.

411
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,520
The Serious Disaster Punishment Act is to be enforced soon,

412
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,321
and I'd like to compare the sentencing.

413
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:10,021
It'd be of great help if I could have the organized minutes

414
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,505
of the General Conference.

415
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,131
Yes.

416
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:17,701
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

417
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:18,600
   

418
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,917
Moo Ryul, what brought you here unnoticed?

419
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:26,071
You're even going to meddle with the Serious Disaster Punishment Act?

420
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,951
What? Do companies seem to have things easy now?

421
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,565
Two laborers died again while working yesterday,

422
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:40,623
but the companies won't be punished as they have less than 50 workers.

423
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,000
The problem is, such companies

424
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,191
are the affiliates of big companies,

425
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,431
and plutocrats own 100 percent of their shares.

426
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:51,666
The law is too loose.

427
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:56,240
If executives receive a criminal punishment for a simple accident,

428
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,260
no one will be willing to run a business.

429
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,341
Moo Ryul, I believe you're saying this

430
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,165
as a member of the Jusung family,

431
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:12,262
but it sounds very dangerous for a judge's remark.

432
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:20,752
Look, Professor Na Geun Woo,

433
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:24,901
I'm saying this because I find it ridiculous to hear you

434
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:27,131
criticize businesspeople's sense of shame and responsibility

435
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:30,271
by mentioning this Serious Accidents Punishment Act.

436
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:34,491
You are not in a place to question if I'm qualified to be a judge.

437
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:38,811
It's not like we've been close in-laws,

438
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,510
and my sister is trying to trample on me for her intentions.

439
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,981
I doubt we need to keep manners,

440
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,620
so let me just stick to the point.

441
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,921
Your wife, Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul,

442
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,021
stop her.

443
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:55,758
You better not even try to decline.

444
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:00,304
Stop her no matter what.

445
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,241
Since you're a former judge, you must know from experience.

446
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:08,841
A conclusion comes first, and then you come up with grounds.

447
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,569
Tell her to stop investigating Jusung,

448
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:15,880
and use your skilled tongue to persuade her.

449
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,189
If she doesn't stop,

450
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:34,020
you'll be sharing this picture with the entire country.

451
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:43,240
Don't be too shocked.

452
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,181
A scandal like this tends to go rampant

453
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:48,004
behind the back of those involved.

454
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,638
I used to be quite close to Prosecutor Ko.

455
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:02,191
He didn't get paid much for his job, but he was nice enough

456
00:31:02,191 --> 00:31:04,460
to give his sister-in-law allowances.

457
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,001
So when they wanted to get divorced, I came up to stop them.

458
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,700
Things were handled without much trouble,

459
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,240
so I didn't get why they still wanted a divorce.

460
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,304
Guess what Hye Ryul told me.

461
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:21,235
"Now isn't the problem."

462
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:24,290
"I don't want to have any future problems."

463
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,865
That's what she is like.

464
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:31,761
She never hesitates to cut off possible problems.

465
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,804
If this becomes an issue, you will get cut off right away.

466
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,001
Moo Ryul.

467
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,765
A professor's affair with his student?

468
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:47,870
You are not in the place to talk about ethics to others.

469
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,178
That's ridiculous!

470
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,375
- Honey. 
 - What is it?

471
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,960
- I'm sad. 
 - Why?

472
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,793
- You see... 
 - Hold on.

473
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,145
It's me.

474
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
I told you not to call me unless it was urgent.

475
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,485
What?

476
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,391
What are you talking about?

477
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,981
They are...

478
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,141
going after where?

479
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,550
Those people are unbelievable.

480
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,421
Prosecutor Ko, have you been planning this search and seizure?

481
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:14,860
Will you be searching and seizing through Mr. Han Gun Do's office too?

482
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,730
Aren't you burdened to go against your ex-wife's family?

483
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,561
- Please say a word about it. 
 - Let us through.

484
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,600
- Sir! 
 - Wait a minute!

485
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,040
- Please say a word! 
 - Tell us what you think!

486
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,170
- Mr. Ko! 
 - Prosecutor Ko!

487
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,141
   

488
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,024
What?

489
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,235
What did you just say?

490
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,911
How dare they try to raid here

491
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,281
when I'm right here?

492
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,580
Where is Gun Do? How dare these people...

493
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,161
Let me grasp the situation first. We're a little flustered too.

494
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:46,630
This means the court issued a warrant against us,

495
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,980
then the detailed charge or suspicion...

496
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,260
No one saw this coming?

497
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:54,831
Throughout the process of the prosecution's request and the court granting the warrant,

498
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,540
how could we have no idea?

499
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,810
I think they deliberately kept it from us.

500
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,710
Find out what happened and how.

501
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,627
Where is Gun Do, that punk?

502
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:12,282
Look. What are you doing in an empty office?

503
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,851
Please cooperate.

504
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:18,321
Look who this is.

505
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,730
He's my ex-son-in-law.

506
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,060
You shouldn't be this disrespectful in your ex-father-in-law's office.

507
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,270
The prosecution is not as powerful these days.

508
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,531
We only follow orders.

509
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:34,571
This is all thanks to your overly know-it-all eldest daughter.

510
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,281
No way.

511
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:40,781
She only acts up, thinking she knows it all. You know her very well.

512
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:44,020
No, I absolutely don't.

513
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,781
We'll take that desktop.

514
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,551
The desktop itself?

515
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,891
Are you sure you aren't unfairly targeting us to take revenge?

516
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,830
That's what the prosecution does.

517
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,643
This isn't even new.

518
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:57,931
- That's how you make money. 
 - Darn, that's not true.

519
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,071
I just slack off these days.

520
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:03,501
What happened has happened, so we'll stick to the standard tactics.

521
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,511
Do whatever it takes to arrest those runaway executives related to Christmas Fund,

522
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,210
and interrogate Dolphin to make a statement

523
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,810
about those mentioned in the recording.

524
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,480
I doubt we will even get to see Dolphin.

525
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,121
Mr. Ko is practically keeping him in his office.

526
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:22,745
I'll try talking to Mr. Ko.

527
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,731
Ms. Han, we have a big problem!

528
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,546
Take a look at this.

529
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:38,201
 Today, the prosecution pushed ahead with their sudden search and seizure against Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, 

530
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:39,741
 the country's biggest law firm. 

531
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,841
 Being safe and unharmed under every former regime, 

532
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:47,110
 Ham &amp; Lee law corporation is said to be more powerful than the Blue House. 

533
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:53,380
 A lot of attorneys in Ham &amp; Lee law corporation are former prosecutors and high government officials, 

534
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,221
 and a lot of their former attorneys are high government officials. 

535
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:01,931
 Thus, it has helped them create a tight cartel with the government parties, prosecution, and legal circles. 

536
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:05,560
 That's why this search and seizure is considered an unprecedented act. 

537
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,701
 But behind the search and seizure, the eldest daughter of Han Gun Do, the current CEO of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation... 

538
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:15,241
 Most assume that this is intended to suppress Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul of the Seoul Prosecutors' Office. 

539
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,310
 Also, her husband, Professor Na Geun Woo of Minguk University Law School, 

540
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,210
 is still an associate attorney of Ham &amp; Lee. 

541
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,221
 As this couple is being mentioned as presidential candidates, we can predict that this incident is a  signal 

542
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:29,571
 to go against both of them. 

543
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:34,978
A card to go against both of us.

544
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,160
Pardon?

545
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,971
No, I'm just getting curious

546
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:43,906
about what they have found.

547
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:47,392
I'm just as clueless.

548
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,241
 Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul's husband, Professor Na Geun Woo, 

549
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,080
 is still a part of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation. 

550
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,749
 It's assumed to be outside pressure against Prosecutor Han. 

551
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:21,210
Honey, what is... What is going on?

552
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,210
I'm so astonished.

553
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:28,411
Honey, are you all right?

554
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:31,780
Don't be on edge. It's not good for your health.

555
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,791
How could they do this to Ham &amp; Lee? Is this possible?

556
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,830
Honey, I'm so scared.

557
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,830
Hurry home.

558
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,795
I need you by my side.

559
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,379
Yes.

560
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:49,971
Yes.

561
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,671
Okay.

562
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,688
This is amusing.

563
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,121
Did they leave?

564
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,650
Did you defend yourselves with what the warrant stated?

565
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,891
They just left. Don't get me started.

566
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:14,031
As if they had installed cameras in my office,

567
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,860
they took everything that seemed necessary.

568
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,500
 They came determined. 

569
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,831
According to the warrant, there are suspicious circumstances in which the law firm takes on cases

570
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:27,071
within restrictive periods of former prosecutor lawyers, and that you handle such cases privately.

571
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,171
Do you perhaps have slush funds?

572
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,210
As if.

573
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,710
Your grandpa purposely opened an office to have influence over me.

574
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,221
He would never let me do such a thing. You know what he's like.

575
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,420
You idiot! You knew it, didn't you?

576
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,790
It was you, wasn't it?

577
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,860
Father, what are you talking about?

578
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,130
I'm their target. I didn't do anything!

579
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,860
How dare you let them in here?

580
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,801
They are giving me shudders too!

581
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,500
After what I did to the prosecution,

582
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,301
I had no idea they'd stab me in the back like this!

583
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,341
I don't know what you have up your sleeve,

584
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:04,281
but if it harms Hye Ryul even a slight bit, I will make you pay the price!

585
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:07,080
I will never let someone like you mess with Hye Ryul!

586
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,840
 Hye Ryul is my daughter, Father! 

587
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,650
Hye Ryul is my daughter!

588
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,591
If you think you can do something, you're deluding yourself.

589
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:19,195
Who are you to take care of her?

590
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,130
I meant that I wouldn't cause her any harm.

591
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,431
That's a given.

592
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,500
If they find anything about you during this search and seizure,

593
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,241
that will just be your problem. Got it?

594
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:34,270
Yes.

595
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:39,480
How dare you even speak of taking care of her, you stupid fool?

596
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,585
The problem is that you seduced my daughter into marrying you.

597
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,851
Mother,

598
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,860
this incident has nothing to do with our marriage—

599
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,750
Yes, it does!

600
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,352
It does.

601
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,101
I know exactly what you're like.

602
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:01,565
You're the cause of all problems in this family.

603
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,373
   

604
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,841
Order in some food.

605
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:11,980
We'll get started as soon as we finish eating.

606
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,460
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

607
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:25,360
I'm sorry, but have dinner at the cafeteria.

608
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,400
I'll skip it.

609
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,031
Didn't you see what was written outside the office?

610
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:38,140
Only those involved are allowed in for security reasons.

611
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,085
I think I'm directly involved.

612
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,851
You're right about that.

613
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:46,080
You're way too directly involved

614
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,281
that coming into this office itself is worth a punishment.

615
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:49,650
What are you trying to pull?

616
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,774
That's my question for you.

617
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:56,821
Are you intending to violate every rule of investigation?

618
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,120
I thought you loved following rules.

619
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,930
Investigations take place closed-door. That's the rule.

620
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,230
If an investigation's security is intervened,

621
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,761
even before the indictment,

622
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:07,901
it could mean the suspect is trying to tamper with the evidence.

623
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:09,520
You know that.

624
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:13,710
Are you patronizing me about criminal law?

625
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,241
No way.

626
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:19,740
I could never dare to lecture you.

627
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,810
You are always placed first in everything.

628
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,420
I know how competent you are.

629
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,620
Stop with the gibberish.

630
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,170
Are you going to be unfair like this?

631
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,525
   

632
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,641
You talk about being unfair?

633
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,800
Then, were you fair yourself?

634
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,571
Are you saying that you were being fair and I wasn't?

635
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:49,809
Is that why you direct the investigation to beat up, knock up,

636
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,381
and batter based on facts of suspected crime?

637
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,441
Is that fair?

638
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:55,310
That's exactly why the prosecution goes through a reformation.

639
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,110
Hey, Han Hye Ryul.

640
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,721
You think you're the only fair one

641
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:02,451
since the world runs according to your thoughts and will, right?

642
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,761
What did you tell me when we got divorced?

643
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:07,890
Are you acting this way out of spite of our divorce?

644
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,601
Holding a grudge like this?

645
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,031
Do I look like a child to you?

646
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,330
Do you think I'd stick my neck out of spite?

647
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,374
You know, I put my neck on the line for this.

648
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:19,370
You and I have different paths,

649
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,140
but we have the same goal!

650
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,410
But if we have different paths, one of us has to fall out.

651
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,881
So, I'm trying my best not to fall.

652
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,611
What did I say during our divorce for you to act this way?

653
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,631
You don't even remember, do you?

654
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,591
Do you think I was entertained because I couldn't pay for my drinks?

655
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:37,160
I was there inevitably since those people gathered up like that.

656
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,591
What did you say when disciplinary action was being discussed?

657
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,791
I said I'd try to take care of it no matter what,

658
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,960
and you said you didn't want it to become a problem later,

659
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,401
so you wanted me to submit to the disciplinary measure

660
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:49,801
or quit myself, didn't you?

661
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,941
I mean, there would be no problem if you followed the rules.

662
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:54,971
So that you can succeed and I give up my job?

663
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:57,111
Well, you didn't do as I told you and idled your way until now.

664
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,640
You got what you wanted then, didn't you?

665
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,309
Sure.

666
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:02,011
That's why we got divorced.

667
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:05,363
Right. So, you're telling me

668
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,791
that divorcing me is what you didn't want.

669
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,814
Because you regret it?

670
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,311
Stop playing games with me.

671
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:15,986
Don't delude yourself.

672
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:19,999
You think you're so charming that men are helpless around you.

673
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,701
It's just that they don't want to fight a person with a bad temper,

674
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,571
and they are shaking over your background.

675
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:27,511
They just want to leech off on the amazing background of your family.

676
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:29,083
That's why I

677
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,381
became a fool trying to leech off on you.

678
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:32,781
Do you know that?

679
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:36,381
That tag is still dangling on me, darn it!

680
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,521
So you're acting this way to get rid of that tag?

681
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,620
This is disclosing the facts of a suspected crime

682
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,840
and leaking of investigation secrets,

683
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,243
but I'll tell you especially because you're my ex-wife.

684
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,971
You got rid of me, the father of your child,

685
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:56,201
shaking and worrying that the smallest things would go wrong.

686
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:59,084
How clean do you think

687
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:01,400
Na Geun Woo, the face of your family, is?

688
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,050
We'll find out.

689
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:15,080
Was the goal of your actions

690
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,721
him all along?

691
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:23,559
Then, do you think I went all the way there myself

692
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
just to lure out some old men?

693
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:29,631
Sounds like a good target.

694
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:31,801
Now, you look like a real prosecutor.

695
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:35,310
Yes, an investigation should be sexy like this.

696
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,695
That's how you get people's attention.

697
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:45,127
He is a bit sexy, isn't he?

698
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:50,620
And let me straighten this up.

699
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,860
I didn't divorce you because there could be a problem.

700
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,660
You were so unattractive as a person

701
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,529
that I couldn't live with you anymore.

702
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,334
You're so foolish.

703
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,050
But I must talk business before I leave.

704
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,691
I will leak how frequently Dolphin came to the prosecution service.

705
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:25,400
You won't be able to have Dolphin around anymore.

706
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,379
Now, it's under my jurisdiction.

707
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,260
   

708
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,490
What brings you here?

709
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:57,799
I was worried.

710
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,390
Are you all right?

711
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,738
It's embarrassing.

712
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,600
   

713
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Is there a need to provoke him like that in this situation?

714
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,901
He will gradually be more offended.

715
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:18,379
I want him to be offended.

716
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:19,710
Excuse me?

717
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:24,381
He needs to lose his reasoning so that his judgment is blurred,

718
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:28,170
and his judgment needs to be blurred so that he will overdo himself.

719
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:33,985
And he needs to overdo himself so that there will be a weakness.

720
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,600
   

721
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,705
Even if I became an old man standing aside,

722
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:15,201
you got rid of my stay area without a word when I'm well and alive.

723
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:18,081
We don't have to work alongside together,

724
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:20,971
but it is a courtesy to give a word about these things.

725
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,810
This old man has become so useless.

726
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:28,150
Gosh. How could you say such a thing, Mr. Ham?

727
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,221
I came here straight away at your word

728
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:34,290
and am sitting here under your hands

729
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,466
like a puppy.

730
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:41,640
So, please do not be so upset,

731
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,538
and...

732
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:46,364
I have never forgotten being polite

733
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,031
in any situation in my life, so far.

734
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:51,023
How dare I

735
00:47:51,023 --> 00:47:53,870
get rid of the stay area of the former Supreme Court Justice,

736
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,440
who had a leading role in the Korean Judicature?

737
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,912
I mean, how could I step foot without your approval?

738
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,733
Are you trying to drive a wedge between your family members?

739
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:15,440
Well, I'm not sure... where I saw it at the moment.

740
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,401
Maybe it was Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," or...

741
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:20,471
Sima Qian's "Record of the Grand Historian."

742
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:22,726
"Counter measures."

743
00:48:22,726 --> 00:48:25,760
This is a great strategy

744
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,097
to destroy the enemy with no energy.

745
00:48:29,097 --> 00:48:33,426
So, you're saying it's that jerk who brought you in?

746
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,171
 Attack me. 

747
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:42,051
 Why are you all thinking of this in a difficult and complicated way? 

748
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:44,675
 Just attack me! 

749
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:49,161
 I think you need to say that more simply for us to understand. 

750
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:52,081
 Attack me. What's so difficult about that? 

751
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:54,131
 When you prepare for the news, 

752
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,171
 you pick up the most attractive one, don't you? 

753
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:59,471
 Ham Min Heon's son-in-law, Han Hye Ryul's father, 

754
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:01,640
 and Na Geun Woo's father-in-law. What better picture do you need? 

755
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,910
 Hey, Mr. Jang, work me up. 

756
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,710
 If you work me up, everything will be revealed! 

757
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,781
 When that jerk Na Geun Woo was a judge, 

758
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,111
 we brought him and used him as a butler and an attorney 

759
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:13,651
 when he cried over his father's debt. He used to clear up the dirt. 

760
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:15,520
 That dirt is still there. 

761
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,120
 I'll package that up on paper and hand it over. Take it all. 

762
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,730
 Who is he to nitpick about the illegal succession of Jusung? 

763
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,761
 If you want to be precise, he's the one who planned it. 

764
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:29,329
 That dirt probably is decayed and has maggots all over. 

765
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:33,810
 I'll organize it all on the computer and give it to you. Take it. 

766
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,370
 Search warrants exist to be used in these moments. 

767
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,718
 Gosh, how can I repay you for this? 

768
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,943
 He thinks the winning odds are with us. 

769
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:46,650
 Don't you think so? 

770
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,150
 Winning odds or what-not, I just don't like him. 

771
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,620
 Those nothing guys talk of culture and justice, my foot. 

772
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,009
 Who are they to discuss justice? 

773
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:58,201
 They must experience anxiety to know where they stand. 

774
00:49:58,201 --> 00:50:02,360
 Bravo! Gosh, that's great! 

775
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,860
Are you claiming that you didn't go there that day?

776
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:28,246
Prosecutor, it's not a claim. I really didn't go.

777
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:31,000
There are people who saw you that day.

778
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,100
Do you think that makes sense?

779
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,401
Somebody saw me?

780
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:39,000
Who are they? Bring them over right now.

781
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,241
I'm saying that I didn't go.

782
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:42,841
Who's saying that they saw me there?

783
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:45,483
Yes, Senior Prosecutor.

784
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,663
That's a bit difficult for me.

785
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:52,470
I just know how to handle computers a bit, that's all.

786
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,660
How can a virus spread all of a sudden?

787
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,533
Prosecutor.

788
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,197
Just a moment.

789
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:06,034
I know how to handle computers.

790
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,071
Yes, she's right.

791
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:10,901
If she digressed, she would have been a scary criminal.

792
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,701
- Hey. 
 - I'm right, though.

793
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:15,749
Yes.

794
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:17,176
Yes.

795
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,150
Let's eat.

796
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,451
I might sound a bit old-fashioned,

797
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:32,375
but my heart flutters and I feel nervous sitting here.

798
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,964
Actually, I feel the same way.

799
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:38,430
Kyung Yoon, have you changed your mind to become a prosecutor?

800
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,401
What about the law firm?

801
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:42,620
Well, I'm still thinking about it.

802
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,770
Why isn't Nan Hee coming down?

803
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,071
She hasn't answered the text either.

804
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,611
She's working right now.

805
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:49,571
What work?

806
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:52,210
Well, there is a virus on my mom's computer suddenly.

807
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,681
She went to check on that.

808
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,301
Your mother?

809
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,051
How is your mother? Is she all right?

810
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:02,750
She first told me it was nothing and I shouldn't be surprised.

811
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,070
She called me to say it's no big deal,

812
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,960
though it sounds like a big deal.

813
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,430
She's amazing.

814
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,123
I was surprised to see the news.

815
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:14,617
I would've been scared to death.

816
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:17,741
You need guts to be a prosecutor.

817
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,652
I have my dad.

818
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,341
There he is.

819
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,641
Where's my princess?

820
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,389
Dad!

821
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:28,959
Hi!

822
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,762
- Let's go say hello. 
 - Okay.

823
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,366
There she is.

824
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,578
My princess.

825
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:45,301
I should think about working as a prosecutor.

826
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:48,701
I have no guts or a dad like hers.

827
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,178
Hey.

828
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:28,310
   

829
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,062
   

830
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,590
   

831
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,751
   

832
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,071
   

833
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,898
   

834
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,210
Professor Hwang!

835
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,910
Professor Hwang, do you need help?

836
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,551
No! I'm okay.

837
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:46,471
No. I happen to

838
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,750
have a class. I can help you.

839
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,898
Seriously. I said, no!

840
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:09,611
I just called you for some tea.

841
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:11,494
Relax and enjoy it.

842
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,910
And what happened today is up to the grown-ups to deal with.

843
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,920
You don't need to worry about it.

844
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,290
Still, you shouldn't have done that.

845
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,361
You should've told us. You knew it all along.

846
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:26,593
Why are you blaming me?

847
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:30,830
Prosecutor Ko was in charge of Ham &amp; Lee's search and seizure.

848
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:31,930
Uncle Won Kyung?

849
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,330
Yes. The chief prosecutor doesn't investigate himself.

850
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:38,230
The chief prosecutor only gets reported in his office,

851
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:41,710
and things like this must not be leaked

852
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,834
no matter how close we are or even if we were once a family.

853
00:55:46,881 --> 00:55:51,920
You'll eventually become a prosecutor, so keep that in mind.

854
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:55,125
I can't believe Uncle Won Kyung.

855
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,460
Kang Baek, are you okay?

856
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,797
Yes.

857
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,910
What did Senior Prosecutor Han say?

858
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,350
- Did she tell you not to worry? 
 - Yes.

859
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,647
Right.

860
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:23,960
I know her from experience.

861
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,152
She's probably busy working

862
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,831
as if nothing ever happened.

863
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,108
You majored in computer engineering.

864
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,835
How did you come to law school?

865
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:47,754
There are people who deserve to die.

866
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:52,598
Becoming a prosecutor was the only way to beat them up legally.

867
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,260
I wonder how you're going to beat them up.

868
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,337
Are you like Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul?

869
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:06,070
I'm going to finish them off.

870
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,464
I'm not sure what Senior Prosecutor Han is like.

871
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,005
You're more aggressive than you look.

872
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:21,809
Prosecutor Han may look tough outside, but is soft at heart.

873
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:25,167
- She's soft? 
 - Totally.

874
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,177
The juniors love her.

875
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,651
She's reliable and warm.

876
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:35,159
She's like a sweet big sister.

877
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:39,779
She looks different from how she actually appears.

878
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,710
Prosecutors are different from judges.

879
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,310
We don't just share joy and sorrow.

880
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,411
We literally live together.

881
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:06,020
Besides, an investigation shows who you are.

882
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,120
It shows your belief, perspective, and temper.

883
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,781
Senior Prosecutor Han is full of charms.

884
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:19,985
Professor Na Geun Woo must be very happy.

885
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:34,221
   

886
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:40,775
   

887
00:58:56,731 --> 00:58:58,215
Prosecutor Han!

888
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,981
 Yes, come in. 

889
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:38,741
   

890
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,704
   

891
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,680
 There's one student who didn't come back to the dorm last night, 

892
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,040
 and no one has heard from her since. 

893
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,239
 She goes to law school. A female student. 

894
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:52,991
 Collect the fingerprints. 

895
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:57,115
 When you identify the body, check if she's a student here. 

896
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,454
   

897
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:37,430



898
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,540
♫  Take off the mask  ♫

899
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:55,075
   

900
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:02,210
♫  Why are you trying to hide it?  ♫

901
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:11,890
♫  Sing out your voice as sharp as an awl  ♫

902
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:17,090
♫  Reveal yourself  ♫

903
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:24,320
♫  Get out into the world  ♫

904
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,870
♫  Why do you want to hide?  ♫

905
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,560
♫  Tell me why  ♫

906
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,500
 I can't let these jokers bring down Jusung or Ham &amp; Lee law corporation. 

907
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,330
 Go down alone. 

908
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,201
 I can't go down alone. 

909
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,841
 If we miss them this time, there won't be another chance. 

910
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:50,410
 Do you think it's prudent of us to go after Christmas Fund too? 

911
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,881
 Who are the higher-ups you're suspecting to be guilty? 

912
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:56,611
 Did you give her any advice on the Blue House search and seizure? 

913
01:01:56,611 --> 01:02:00,915
 You are the only one who's there to comfort and care for me. 

914
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:03,920
 Reveal how many times Dolphin visited the prosecution service. 

915
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,460
 What do you think they found on the computer? 

916
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,821
 What if we don't disclose it and keep it to ourselves? 

917
01:02:06,821 --> 01:02:09,625
 Should I hand it over to that crazy woman? 

918
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,770
 That won't work on the crazy woman.
