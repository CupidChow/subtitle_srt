1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,855
   

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:06,298
What do you know?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,584
What do you have?

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,825
I don't know what you're saying.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,054
How about this?

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,881
Were you on her side?

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,341
What were you two after?

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,157
You even hurt Kang Baek.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,571
You jerk.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,676
Answer me.

11
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:39,770
Just spill it!

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,230
From the get-go, you two...

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,740
 Hye Ryul! 

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,680
People can easily hear you guys. What on earth is this?

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,849
Let's go inside.

16
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:05,320
No one can be trusted right now, even if they're family.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,330



18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,339
A hacking program was installed in the USB flash drive from Hong Nan Hee.

19
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm sure he knows what she was after and what she had.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,804
I know nothing about this.

21
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:29,149
This is my first time hearing you got a USB flash drive from her.

22
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,420
You really don't know anything about this?

23
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,900
And she didn't give you anything?

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,360
   

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,329
   

26
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,479
   

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,559
   

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,188
   

29
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,350
   

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,809
No, she didn't.

31
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,719
Stop lying to me.

32
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,919
There was no way you didn't know.

33
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,603
That's enough.

34
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,290
She's dead anyway.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,174
Mom.

36
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,519
He was...

37
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,259
She and he...

38
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,245
I know.

39
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,719
He was having an affair with Hong Nan Hee.

40
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,814
Mom, you knew?

41
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,270
Since when?

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,570
Protecting Kang Baek is our highest priority.

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,309
How long have you known?

44
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:29,879
Why didn't you tell me?

45
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,880
Is that important?

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,364
Yes, it's important to me!

47
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,369
I've known for about a year.

48
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,730
At first, I thought he would lose interest after a while.

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,086
Later on, I didn't tell you because I thought

50
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:50,599
you wanted to hide it when you knew what was going on.

51
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,899
How...

52
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:55,599
How could you keep it from me for a year?

53
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,380
How could you let me live with a cheater for a year?

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,683
- How... 
 - Hye Ryul,

55
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:08,091
I can't stand that jerk more than you

56
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,969
because I know men like him too well.

57
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,851
They approach you with a goal, and once you give them what they want,

58
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:19,733
they look elsewhere right away.

59
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,830
"It's suffocating. I need to be comforted."

60
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,150
They come up with absurd excuses to justify their action.

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,570
As time passes by,

62
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,493
they lose any sense of shame, humiliation, or gratitude,

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,338
but this isn't the time to expose our family problem.

64
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:47,293
No. We can't show our flaws, even to our own family.

65
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,229
You two should share the bedroom again.

66
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,129
- Mom. 
 - I still

67
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,990
go to bed and wake up in the same room with a man worse than him.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,860
Why do you think I do that?

69
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,749
Protect your son.

70
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:08,108
You'll live only then.

71
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,769
I know that times have changed,

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,000
but this hasn't changed for moms.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,010
When something goes wrong for your child, it will kill you.

74
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,290
The same goes for you too.

75
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,119
If something happens to Kang Baek or Hye Ryul,

76
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:34,137
I won't have a reason to spare you.

77
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:54,240
   

78
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,330
   

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,129
Gosh! Why is there so much to write?

80
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,930
Will we be able to write everything during the exam?

81
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,693
Interestingly, you somehow find a way when it's time.

82
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,899
This is a patent of legal nature, right?

83
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,509
Well, according to the law, it says it's a license,

84
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,840
but in real cases, it's considered a patent.

85
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,409
According to the Public Waters Reclamation Law, the precedent says

86
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,919
- it's a patent of legal nature. 
 - Ji Yi.

87
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,120
- That's what it says. 
 - Yes?

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,290
- So in principle... 
 - Today's question was really hard.

89
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,320
So it's helpful to memorize cases

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,189
where the legal expressions and the true nature of the law

91
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:02,530
don't match.

92
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,189
Some of the patents might be binding acts,

93
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:07,109
so we might be confused between patents and permits.

94
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,742
Look at you, all dressed up.

95
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,570
Are you seeing your girlfriend?

96
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,339
Who is she? Can't you tell me?

97
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,209
I don't think he's coming back tonight.

98
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,939
Right. Don't wait up for me. Just go to sleep.

99
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,779
Can't you stay out for a week?

100
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,610
You wake up at the crack of dawn. It always bothers me.

101
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,749
Hey, 6 a.m. isn't the crack of dawn.

102
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,280
You just wake up late.

103
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,949
I think it is the crack of dawn.

104
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,959
How can a law student wake up at 6 a.m.?

105
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,090
Right? Gosh, I got the wrong roommate.

106
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,558
What? The wrong roommate?

107
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,530
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,739
Let's go and eat.

109
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,937
Sure. Let's go.

110
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,993
See you.

111
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,145
I'm leaving too.

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,760
Jang Il!

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,967
What is this? Ji Yi...

114
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:20,469
 A kid got caught smuggling Adderall, and Ji Yi's name came up!  
  (T/N: A synthetic drug used as a stimulant) 

115
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,275
 Ji Yi was the client! 

116
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,127
Gosh. Hello.

117
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,004
This way, sir.

118
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,351
   

119
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,549
Tell them you brought that in for your use.

120
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,250
Don't drag Ji Yi into this.

121
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,520
They're just leftover pills from your prescription.

122
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,455
Tell them you didn't know Adderall was illegal in Korea.

123
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:20,167
That way, you'll get off with a stay of prosecution,

124
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,823
and I'll try to get you that.

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,940
I heard an arrest could be dropped too.

126
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,176
What?

127
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,079
I heard that was a better deal.

128
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,917
Can't you pull that off given your position?

129
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,170
Why did you do it?

130
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,558
I told you to just focus on your studies. Why did you do that?

131
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,700
Is that girl even your friend?

132
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,119
She used you to blackmail me.

133
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,289
She told me to get her arrest dropped.

134
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,895
Stop crying, and say something.

135
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:10,291
I wanted to get good grades and lose weight too,

136
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,845
but I couldn't stay awake or focused,

137
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,090
and I gained weight too.

138
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,220
But that's not a bad drug.

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,090
It treats ADHD. 
  (T/N: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) 

140
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,490
Kids in the US take Adderall when they study for their exams.

141
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,193
Hey! How could you...

142
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:31,350
I thought if I took it again, I would be able to focus better.

143
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,600
So are you telling me you started taking it when you were in the US?

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,709
Everyone was taking it.

145
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,610
I was worried that I might fall behind without it.

146
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,150
Are you seriously using that as your excuse?

147
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,519
Even so, how could you take drugs? How could you be so reckless?

148
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,289
This is why I told you I didn't want her to go abroad.

149
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,720
Studying abroad ruins kids' lives.

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,360
You don't know anything.

151
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,851
If we didn't send her abroad, with her grades,

152
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:57,830
she couldn't have even dreamed of going to Minguk University.

153
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,310
Good grief!

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,899
What did Won Kyung say?

155
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,039
He went to the same school as the prosecutor in charge,

156
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,070
and they were both members of the same research society.

157
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,569
He'll talk to his friend.

158
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:15,075
Uncle Won Kyung won't say anything to Kang Baek, right?

159
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:18,163
Are you seriously worried about that now?

160
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,139
- Jang Il. 
 - You punk.

161
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,389
Kang Baek didn't do it,

162
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,604
but what about Ji Yi?

163
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,755
Ji Yi did it.

164
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,978
Won Kyung. That's—

165
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:48,920
Jang Il, after this, not only just Ham &amp; Lee,

166
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,220
but she won't be able to marry anyone.

167
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,520
Even if her father is a chief prosecutor, who would want a drug addict as their daughter-in-law?

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,160
Ji Yi.

169
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,333
Dad!

170
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,603
Dad.

171
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,149
No, Ji Yi.

172
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,879
 There's someone I'm suspecting. 

173
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,206
You're late.

174
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,735
Yes.

175
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,889
So who are you suspecting? Whose name did you give the detective as a culprit?

176
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:16,225
I'm not certain yet. It was just my own speculation.

177
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,920
I'll tell you once the investigation moves forward a bit more.

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,264
It's not you?

179
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,365
What?

180
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:35,743
The culprit. You're not the culprit?

181
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,433
Where were you that night?

182
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,201
If you can't even answer that,

183
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,973
you should just keep your mouth shut.

184
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:50,713
Murder isn't the only secret in the world.

185
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:15,567
   

186
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,122
 You're leaving at this hour? 

187
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,843
 Do I look pretty? 

188
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,129
 You're going to see Na Geun Woo, right? 

189
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:24,470
 Do I look pretty? 

190
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,390
 Yes, you look pretty. You do, 

191
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,970
 but where are you going this late? 

192
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,210
 There's someone I have to meet this late without anyone knowing. 

193
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,050
 Exactly. It must be Na Geun Woo. 

194
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,279
 You still didn't end it with him? 

195
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,749
 What? Do you think he's the only one I make plans with? 

196
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:45,271
 Nan Hee, what's wrong with you? 

197
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,889
 End it. 

198
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,029
 If you don't, I won't be your friend either. 

199
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,185
 I'll end it. 

200
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,430
 Really? 

201
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,278
 Yes. 

202
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,309
 So where are you going? Are you going to be late? 

203
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,101
 - Ah Jeong. 
 - Yes? 

204
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,879
 There's a letter I didn't get to send yet. 

205
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,701
 A letter? 

206
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,069
 The recipient won't take it if it's from me, 

207
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,990
 so I want you to send it for me. 

208
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,554
   

209
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,960
"The data will be wiped permanently

210
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,716
after three incorrect attempts."

211
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,769
   

212
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,749
   

213
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:19,677
   

214
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,635
Gu Won.

215
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,120
Gu Won.

216
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,029
Hey, you're here.

217
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,229
Why do you look so serious?

218
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,771
Isn't the answer obvious?

219
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,230
 You're taking it from the bottom.  
    

220
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,200
 - You should hold it up. 
 - Let me take it. 

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,399
 I'll take the photo. 

222
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,810
 - All right. One... 
 - Okay. 

223
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,540
 - In one, two, three. 
 - In one, two, three! 

224
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,590
 In two, three. 

225
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,940
 I think I blinked. 

226
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,210
 - Did you blink? 
 - Can you give it back? 

227
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,211
 - Wait. 
 - Did you blink? 

228
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:52,320
 - Did I blink? 
 - Give it back. 

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,656
 We can take it again. 

230
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,149
 - What's wrong? 
 - What is it? 

231
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,190
 What's this? 

232
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,740
 He secretly took photos and stalked her. 

233
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,540
 His album was full of the victim's photos. 

234
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,770
 - The witness saw them himself. 
 - What is this, you jerk? 

235
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,739
 If the victim reported him, and he served time in prison, 

236
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,379
 he wouldn't be able to take the bar exam, 

237
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,519
 so he does have a strong motive to kill her. 

238
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,750
The victim is really frustrating too.

239
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,050
She should have just reported him.

240
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,989
Why did she worry about that pervert's future?

241
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,150
Seriously. Look what happened.

242
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,598
Joong Jin.

243
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:32,989
Gosh, I know.

244
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,993
I know I shouldn't blame the girl.

245
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,929
If she reported him when she found out,

246
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,729
she would have still been here.

247
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:40,929
If she reported him,

248
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:43,699
you think he wouldn't have been able to get close to her?

249
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,139
They would have started taking different classes.

250
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,540
The school would have suspended the stalker right away.

251
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,169
The victim would have gotten a restraining order,

252
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,810
and the stalker would have been arrested.

253
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,739
Then the stalker wouldn't have pestered the victim to settle.

254
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:59,280
The victim and the stalker both wanted the same thing.

255
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,520
An act of justice they could understand,

256
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,290
and going back to their day-to-day life.

257
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,229
That's all.

258
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:06,720
Ms. Hong just thought

259
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,929
not reporting him would've been better for the time being.

260
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,047
We can't criticize her for that.

261
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,012
I won't do that.

262
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,500
Did you request a warrant?

263
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,860
I already filed it,

264
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,499
but we only have a statement from the victim's friend, not her.

265
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,505
- You don't think we'll get it? 
 - Right,

266
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:28,610
but we should still keep trying to the end.

267
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,109
Gosh.

268
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,279
Issue us the warrant!

269
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,727
Let us do our job!

270
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,089
I have my cell phone here. Okay.

271
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,811
Dad!

272
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,084
I want to marry him.

273
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,951
I always wanted to marry Kang Baek.

274
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,010
You said you would be okay with me marrying before I graduate.

275
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,139
Ji Yi, that was before.

276
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,680
Don't you know things have changed now?

277
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,849
Why didn't you tell me he was dating another girl?

278
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,265
They weren't dating.

279
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,490
He was just nice to her because he felt bad.

280
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,220
They weren't dating.

281
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,020
It doesn't matter what the truth is now.

282
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,759
The girl's body was floating on the lake.

283
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,759
What else must we discuss?

284
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,529
If you were engaged, we would've broken it off. There's no way you'll marry him!

285
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:22,770
I don't care anymore.

286
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,549
After today, don't bring up Kang Baek's name

287
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,310
ever again.

288
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,288
I'll marry him!

289
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,210
Why would you?

290
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,679
You don't deserve to be forced into marriage!

291
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,010
You deserve better!

292
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,318
It makes me sad.

293
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,134
I can't live without Kang Baek.

294
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:46,760
Besides, after this, Uncle Won Kyung

295
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,029
won't be able to say anything about that.

296
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,390
I know it always bothered you, Dad.

297
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,899
Jang Ji Yi.

298
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,033
I want to protect Kang Baek.

299
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,581
He is having a really hard time.

300
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,713
I...

301
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,965
need to stay by his side.

302
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:37,969
Why won't you answer my calls?

303
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,250
Well, I've been busy.

304
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,529
Besides, I don't check my phone often.

305
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,334
Why did you want to reach me?

306
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,860
What happened at Minguk University that night?

307
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,355
Why are you asking me?

308
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:57,311
The detectives in charge must have the answer.

309
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,960
Those people weren't there that night.

310
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,875
I wasn't there either.

311
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,223
But I saw you that night.

312
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,410
You weren't in your usual clothes, but it sure was you.

313
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,449
You got the wrong person.

314
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:21,913
I was at home.

315
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,957
Do you really

316
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,713
not know anything at all?

317
00:20:27,713 --> 00:20:29,590
I would appreciate even a small clue.

318
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,721
The culprit must be caught.

319
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,830
But...

320
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,361
why are you so into this case?

321
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,395
It was my turn.

322
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,540
Hong Nan Hee

323
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,724
knew something huge about Jusung and Ham &amp; Lee.

324
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:55,705
She made a final warning to your father,

325
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:59,290
and promised to give me the info in case he didn't admit it.

326
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,259
Your father didn't admit it, and she turned to me.

327
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,819
The night we agreed to meet up,

328
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,762
she died.

329
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,480
This can't be a coincidence.

330
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:17,117
I'm sorry. I don't know anything,

331
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:19,145
nor am I interested.

332
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,910
Is it you? The person who killed Hong Nan Hee?

333
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,130
Eun Mi.

334
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,577
Eun Mi.

335
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:49,855
If you didn't, make a choice

336
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:54,167
whether to help the murderer or me.

337
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:26,409
Ms. Han is going through a lot already.

338
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,809
Why would you add more to such ridiculous rumors?

339
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,259
Let me ask you one thing.

340
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,050
If I stab her in the back,

341
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,570
will you be put in a tight spot?

342
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,649
Then will you break up with me?

343
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,969
Guys, I'm currently at Minguk University.

344
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,879
Hong Nan Hee, a law school student here,

345
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,110
 was murdered brutally not long ago. 

346
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,080
 It breaks my heart the more I think about it, 

347
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,620
 so I've decided to... What? 

348
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,949
 Han Kang Baek's behind me? 

349
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:10,657
 Oh, it's him! 

350
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,860
I can't believe he came to school

351
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,189
after what happened to his girlfriend.

352
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:19,500
That's right, guys. Look. This man is Han Kang Baek.

353
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,200
What? Handsome? Who, me?

354
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,530
   

355
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,499
I know. Yes, I admit it,

356
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:29,539
but his handsome face isn't the matter here.

357
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,679
As you already know, he's from a prestigious family.

358
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,250
His dad is Na Geun Woo, and his mom is Han Hye Ryul.

359
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,550
Yes, that Han Hye Ryul!

360
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,226
The prosecutor, who is willing to take down even Jusung,

361
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:46,117
she is the daughter of the biggest law firm in Korea.

362
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:49,851
Her mom is the dean of the law school here,

363
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,500
and she had Han Kang Baek with her ex-husband.

364
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,570
She got divorced and remarried to Na Geun Woo.

365
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,000
 Aren't you getting a feeling? 

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,209
The police and prosecution must be investigating him first,

367
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:09,010
but look. Do you see it?

368
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,249
No one can dare mess with him. That's why he has the leisure to come to school.

369
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,420
I mean, how can we call this a normal reaction?

370
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,220
His girlfriend was murdered brutally.

371
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,024
Maybe he really killed her.

372
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:22,930
Guys, I'll try to sound him out. Check his facial expression.

373
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,760
His face will show, okay? Here I go.

374
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,739
Hey, tell me.

375
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:30,000
You killed her, didn't you?

376
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,270
Look at this poker face.

377
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,766
Be honest with me. You killed her, right?

378
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,270
How shameless of this jerk.

379
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,490
I hear you were two-timing.

380
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,850
Did you kill her because she clung to you?

381
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,830
Have you heard people call her promiscuous?

382
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,819
- My gosh! 
 - He punched him!

383
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,520
He punched me!

384
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,290
I'm dying here, darn it!

385
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,890
- Did you see? 
 - This is enough.

386
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,389
- Everyone, stop. 
 - Did you see it?

387
00:24:58,389 --> 00:24:59,930
- Stop filming! 
 - This is actually happening.

388
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,769
You son of a gun! Did you kill Hong Nan Hee like this?

389
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,269
Hey, you...

390
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,439
- Stop! 
 - Oh, my goodness!

391
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,040
- You can't do this. 
 - Unbelievable!

392
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,910
He punched me for real!

393
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,709
- Stop filming! 
 - I almost got killed.

394
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,140
This is an actual situation. It's no joke.

395
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,750
Gosh, this is for real.

396
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,570
Hye Ryul, calm down!

397
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,220
Na Geun Woo is with him.

398
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,540
You shouldn't go there, especially during work hours!

399
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,130
If you go there, it'll work against Kang Baek. Don't you get it?

400
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,495
Hye Ryul,

401
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,629
you must be cool-headed at times like this

402
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:38,713
for Kang Baek's sake.

403
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,995
Okay, Mom,

404
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:45,383
but do tell me if you hear anything.

405
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
This makes no sense!

406
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,909
Kang Baek is such a tender-hearted boy!

407
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,319
How did he end up hitting someone?

408
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,489
Arrest Han Kang Baek, the murderer!

409
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,420
- Arrest him! 
 - Arrest him!

410
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,630
Reveal the truth behind the murder case!

411
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,690
- Reveal the truth! 
 - Reveal the truth!

412
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,759
Save Hong Nan Hee's soul!

413
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,029
- Save her! 
 - Save her!

414
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,339
I simply asked him questions, and he suddenly came at me!

415
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,570
Do you see my split lips here?

416
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,139
My teeth are feeling loose too.

417
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,979
Anyway, I want him to be punished severely!

418
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,490
Will you be quiet?

419
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,020
What?

420
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,818
I'm the victim...

421
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:29,619
Are you using your authority to silence me?

422
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,360
Justice no longer exists in this country!

423
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,256
Calm down already.

424
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:38,929
Your words against him and the victim caused this assault.

425
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:43,399
Still, he admits to his action and reflects on it,

426
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,899
- so let's come to a settlement. 
 - A settlement?

427
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:46,939
I refuse to do that,

428
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,510
and what about my words?

429
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,939
You somewhat speak in an annoying way.

430
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,079
I'm the one who got punched.

431
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,350
I'll sue him for spreading false information and defamation.

432
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,550
It was broadcasted in real-time, so the Information Network Act can be applied for a higher penalty,

433
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,350
and it's a piece of cake to gather evidence.

434
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,560
- Kang Baek. 
 - Did you hear this jerk?

435
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,030
Does this make sense?

436
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,121
Yes, it does,

437
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:14,329
and your penalty will be higher.

438
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,080
About the girl who was found dead in the lake of Minguk University,

439
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,149
you know she was going out with Han Hye Ryul's son, right?

440
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,385
It's impossible not to know.

441
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,011
Everyone here gossips about it all day.

442
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,402
She was very pretty.

443
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:45,291
Well, that's probably why Han Hye Ryul's son hit on her.

444
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,630
Then...

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,848
What about this?

446
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,900
Give it to me.

447
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,920
   

448
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,317
What on earth?

449
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,719
Is this true?

450
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:13,041
Darn, this is crazy!

451
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,173
What...

452
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,129
Educated people are worse, indeed.

453
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,200
Is it because they keep things bottled up inside?

454
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,399
They turn out to be perverts in various ways.

455
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,175
How nasty of them.

456
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,925
So what?

457
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,939
Did Na Geun Woo kill her?

458
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:35,419
We can cook it up that way if needed,

459
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:37,263
but...

460
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:40,589
your target is Han Hye Ryul.

461
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,410
She needs to go down

462
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,901
for you to put a neat end to your situation here.

463
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,651
By going down, you mean...

464
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:53,409
I'll strip her prosecutor title off of her.

465
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,172
What do you say?

466
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:04,097
Goodness, Mr. Nam.

467
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:07,540
That wench was practically born with that title.

468
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,952
It's like the title is branded on her body.

469
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:15,179
That picture is something, but it's not enough.

470
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,159
I mean, Na Geun Woo got laid with Hong Nan Hee. It wasn't her.

471
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,389
Especially given the situation, she will never resign.

472
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,731
No way. She knows what she will face then.

473
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:31,530
Even the slightest speck of dust can make you cry so much.

474
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,381
It depends on how this is used. Leave it to me.

475
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:39,043
All right, good.

476
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,061
I like that attitude.

477
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,259
So...

478
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:49,325
what is it that this outstanding attorney

479
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:52,254
wants from me in return?

480
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,459
Hire someone for me.

481
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,436
Someone who can

482
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,800
even kill people on my behalf.

483
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:27,120
My goodness.

484
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,659
This boy is crazy.

485
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,529
Individual streamers are the most frightening these days,

486
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,575
and he dared punch one of them.

487
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,699
This is not like his docile and kind-hearted appearance.

488
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:40,887
I guess appearances can't be trusted.

489
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:44,019
This is just crazy! Don't you think?

490
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,446
Gosh.

491
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,850
Sometimes, things work out in such an unexpected way.

492
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,120
I can hardly read any articles about you, let alone Jusung.

493
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,290
Imprisonment is not even an issue.

494
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,420
No one cares to know anything other than the Minguk University case.

495
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,423
Han Hye Ryul might behave for the time being unless she is insane.

496
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm not sure.

497
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,420
She is a special being, you know.

498
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,759
I can't guarantee,

499
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,639
but that family needs to hide their claws right now.

500
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,379
At first, the people believed

501
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,719
that the family would protect them with the power they had,

502
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,950
but now, they're suspicious if they're using the same power

503
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,659
to cover for their son, a murderer.

504
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,981
I guess.

505
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:37,360
Regarding Jusung's succession issue,

506
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,329
it became a big deal because Han Hye Ryul

507
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,500
wielded her authority with the desire to become a star prosecutor.

508
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,220
It was not even worth the indictment.

509
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,997
Oh, excuse me.

510
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:54,490
Hi.

511
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,010
What?

512
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,150
What? Han Kang Baek was released?

513
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,219
Arrest Han Kang Baek, the murderer!

514
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:06,019
- Arrest him! 
 - Arrest him!

515
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:07,860
- He's coming outside! 
 - There he is!

516
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,660
- Let's go. 
 - Stop them!

517
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,229
   

518
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,800
Han Kang Baek is not the one?

519
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,429
This is ridiculous, guys.

520
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:16,600
The police must investigate him!

521
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,730
Han Kang Baek, did you use your dad's power to be released?

522
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,769
- This is systematic concealment! 
 - Professor Na!

523
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:22,600
You shouldn't be part of it!

524
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,909
Han Kang Baek, tell us the truth!

525
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,640
- This is not right! 
 - Arrest him again!

526
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,309
- Where are you going? 
 - Arrest him!

527
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:29,910
Professor Na!

528
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,879
The parties didn't want a penalty, so the police couldn't keep them anymore.

529
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:35,932
He threw a punch in front of so many people,

530
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:37,750
but he was released only after a few hours!

531
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,960
So what if his family is influential?

532
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,630
His quick release is actually better for us.

533
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,229
The assault case was only going to charge him a fine.

534
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:47,959
It was not the problem.

535
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,899
The problem is that his release will make them

536
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:56,307
look more like the murderer and his accomplices.

537
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,680
Why didn't I know when it was right in front of me?

538
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,625
What?

539
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,934
Nan Hee's hairpin.

540
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,556
It's the same one as Kang Ye's.

541
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:21,930
There are only 300 pieces in the world.

542
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,429
I saw it all the time, but I didn't know it was the same.

543
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,839
I just thought that design was in trend.

544
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,297
Did you know?

545
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,751
Well...

546
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,097
No.

547
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:44,362
I couldn't possibly know what hairpin she wore.

548
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,440
Right.

549
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,110
   

550
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,459
Hi, Kyung Yoon.

551
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,616
It just ended.

552
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:12,475
It's all over now.

553
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,520
Aren't you going to leave work?

554
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,183
- What about you? 
 - I should.

555
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:25,085
Me too.

556
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:36,610
Investigations need confidentiality and time.

557
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,409
But because people swarmed in,

558
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,009
the crime scene was disclosed and damaged.

559
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,250
So many complaints are coming in.

560
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,410
Information is leaking from somewhere unknown.

561
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,901
Now even the false news reports...

562
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,460
I want to catch the culprit.

563
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,890
I'm dying to catch them!

564
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,859
I even dreamed about it last night.

565
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,029
I caught the culprit with a mask on like this.

566
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,400
And?

567
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,930
I woke up the moment I unmasked them,

568
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,259
so I couldn't see the face.

569
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:04,451
Wasn't it Yoon Gu Ryeong?

570
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:06,601
It seemed like him,

571
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,066
but in my dream...

572
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,939
It's no use talking about it.

573
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:13,609
An arrest warrant won't be issued anyway.

574
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,850
There's something we can do even if we have no arrest warrant.

575
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,689
Our specialty.

576
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:21,580
After all, is that the only way?

577
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,104
What is that?

578
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,854
What are you doing here?

579
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:29,027
Gosh.

580
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,759
- Thank you. I was feeling peckish. 
 - That's good.

581
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:38,100
Thanks for bringing us the food, but you look so haggard.

582
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,640
Do you have trouble sleeping? Do you eat properly?

583
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,069
I know. Are you okay?

584
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:45,040
Yes, I'm all right. Everything's all right.

585
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,000
What is that you mentioned?

586
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,295
There's not much to it.

587
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,919
I don't think I did.

588
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,220
- I see. 
 - Okay.

589
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,090
- Ask her some more. 
 - Okay.

590
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,720
 We'll ask questions. 

591
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,290
Hello. I'm from the police.

592
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,330
Are you perhaps a law student?

593
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,450
- Gosh. 
  - We'll search... 

594
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,793
Search properly!

595
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,679
 ...and we'll wait. 

596
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,663
I crave warm soup.

597
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:27,429
You once said we shouldn't eat anything hot while staking out.

598
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,084
Where are you going?

599
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,277
 Where on earth is the rendezvous? 

600
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:32,813
 There are no people to ask around. 

601
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,351
 Han Hye Ryul? 

602
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,094
I'm sure it was Han Hye Ryul.

603
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,290
   

604
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,314
Dad.

605
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,100
Kang Baek is a murderer?

606
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,700
That makes no sense.

607
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,839
A judge shouldn't jump to conclusions like that.

608
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,833
You haven't seen Kang Baek these days, have you?

609
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:36,579
He even assaulted someone today. He's going out of control.

610
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,255
Anyone can be a murderer.

611
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,150
Do you seriously mean that?

612
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,290
It is Kang Baek you're talking about.

613
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,149
Your grandson.

614
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,420
He's the last person who would kill somebody.

615
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,807
Your reaction surprises me more.

616
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,790
Isn't this a nice chance for you?

617
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,029
Dad.

618
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,695
Don't be a softie.

619
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:58,900
Hye Ryul doesn't care for your kids.

620
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,969
When she was after you, she was after your kids.

621
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,451
This is why you can never beat her.

622
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:10,933
Stay alert from now on.

623
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,880
Shouldn't you take after me a little?

624
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,420
I have my own problems to solve.

625
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,150
I can't look after you.

626
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,794
What problems do you have?

627
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,560
Moo Ryul.

628
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,160
Do you see me as a jerk too?

629
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,100
What?

630
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,999
For the past 50 years,

631
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:35,983
I sacrificed myself for the family.

632
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:39,639
Your grandpa founded Ham &amp; Lee, but I grew it big,

633
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,309
so how can they do this to me?

634
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:46,849
My father-in-law, wife, and daughters can't do this to me.

635
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,087
- Dad. 
 - Tell me.

636
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,813
I did what I needed to do as a father.

637
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:55,020
I could say you did what you needed to do as a father,

638
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,489
but you also did things you shouldn't do as a father.

639
00:39:57,489 --> 00:39:59,475
What?

640
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:01,480
What are you talking about?

641
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,696
Hong Nan Hee was aware of Jusung's X-file.

642
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,330
When did you make that file?

643
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,199
No, since when have you been making it?

644
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,191
Oh, that's...

645
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:17,409
Moo Ryul, well... I did that just in case.

646
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:21,380
Marriage can't be smooth sailing all the time.

647
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,489
If you lose your place within the family...

648
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,389
It's okay, Dad. I understand.

649
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:29,859
I've never expected that you'd make an exception.

650
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,845
Right.

651
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,719
But...

652
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,169
are you sure there's no leak?

653
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,343
Of course, I'm sure.

654
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:42,683
Then I'm relieved.

655
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:45,319
Otherwise, things would get so complicated.

656
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,063
Don't come... Don't come near me.

657
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,020
- Don't come closer... 
 - Be quiet.

658
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,260
Stay there. Don't come any closer.

659
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,063
Stop. Don't come any closer.

660
00:42:13,189 --> 00:42:16,129
Where is she? The sound came from somewhere around here.

661
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:18,315
Hold on.

662
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,875
Over there!

663
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,388
Be quiet.

664
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:33,321
It's just a cat.

665
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,137
The cat was too loud,

666
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,161
so I silenced it.

667
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,560
Please... Don't kill me.

668
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,008
- Please spare me. 
 - I told you to be quiet!

669
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,778
You're so loud too.

670
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,199
Everyone is so loud.

671
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:16,390
Don't move. Don't touch the pipe!

672
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,930
If you do, you'll also be charged with police interference.

673
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,474
Eun Mi. Hey!

674
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:26,987
Eun Mi, are you all right?

675
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,685
Hey!

676
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,569
You're under arrest

677
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:37,350
for violating the Animal Protection Act

678
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,170
and the Wildlife Protection and Management Act.

679
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,720
You have the right to an attorney and can explain yourself.

680
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,159
You may request the court to review the legality of the arrest.

681
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,397
Get up.

682
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:52,557
Get up, you jerk!

683
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:12,250
"Allow no sleep to your eyes,

684
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,265
no slumber to your eyelids.

685
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:20,060
Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,

686
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,916
like a bird from the snare of the fowler,

687
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,560
free yourself."

688
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,200
Prayers like this are all useless!

689
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,330
What's the point of praying like this every single day?

690
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,500
- Kang Ye. 
 - Am I wrong?

691
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,200
Are we happy because we always pray for the family's happiness?

692
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,169
Do we love one another? No, we do not!

693
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,310
Kang Ye, we'll talk about this later.

694
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,869
Later? When, Grandma?

695
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:46,149
- I'm not going to school. 
 - What did you say?

696
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:49,350
I'm not going to school! No, I can't.

697
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,770
Everyone already knows who I am.

698
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,881
Kang Baek, I'm sorry,

699
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:56,460
but everyone already calls me a murderer's sister.

700
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,636
Even I'm this upset. Think about how upset Kang Baek must be!

701
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:03,100
Things will quiet down soon. Hang in there—

702
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,159
No, things will not quiet down anytime soon.

703
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,799
I received a witness summon today.

704
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,819
What are you talking about?

705
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:12,569
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

706
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:15,310
When? I'll go with you.

707
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,339
No, I'll go alone.

708
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,950
You don't need to go!

709
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,781
Don't worry about it.

710
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:20,880
Take care of it.

711
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,049
We must be careful. It's turned into a big case now,

712
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:27,595
- so everyone is watching like a hawk. 
 - So?

713
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:31,330
Are you saying you'll let Kang Baek go to the police station?

714
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,089
No, we can't let that happen.

715
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:34,560
I will go.

716
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,267
Don't do anything!

717
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,129
What people say about us is all true!

718
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:42,569
The entire family works in law and sure knows how to evade the law,

719
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:45,917
on top of having no moral compass!

720
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,225
I will confess

721
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,367
that I killed Nan Hee.

722
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,628
Kang Baek.

723
00:45:57,628 --> 00:46:01,120
What is that brat saying now?

724
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,120
I killed Nan Hee!

725
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,924
Kang Baek, what on earth are you talking about?

726
00:46:06,924 --> 00:46:09,291
It wasn't you!

727
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:12,629
Why are you saying that? How do you know it wasn't me?

728
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:14,739
On what grounds?

729
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,299
That's a dangerous remark.

730
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:20,439
Such a false confession out of guilt is inadmissible in court.

731
00:46:20,439 --> 00:46:24,549
Father, many people go to jail because of their false confessions.

732
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,350
Besides, it is true that I killed Nan Hee!

733
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,450
That's enough!

734
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,049
Kang Baek, don't say anything. You're grounded as of today.

735
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:33,960
I killed her!

736
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,904
I really... I really killed her!

737
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:44,603
It was me. I killed Nan Hee!

738
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,883
I did it.

739
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:54,543
What is happening?

740
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:07,223
It's so nice to see you bright and early.

741
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:11,189
I know how busy you are. Thank you for coming all the way here.

742
00:47:11,189 --> 00:47:12,529
Thanks to your dear daughter,

743
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:16,459
we have no choice but to complicate things further.

744
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,169
Even today, I really didn't want to come here,

745
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,693
but Director Yoon said I must meet you in person, so here I am.

746
00:47:23,693 --> 00:47:25,529
Thank you.

747
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:30,044
I practically begged him to persuade you.

748
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:31,709
So what is it?

749
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:35,413
You said I must hear it, or I'd regret it.

750
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:41,020
I'm sure you know that the safest scholarship in this country

751
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,220
is Ham &amp; Lee's cash.

752
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,929
I just let it accumulate,

753
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:50,315
thinking that I'd put it toward a good cause later on,

754
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:52,950
and now, I have five million dollars in reserve.

755
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:01,080
I want to use it to protect Kang Baek,

756
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,775
but I wanted to consult you on how to go about it.

757
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:09,719
I've been thinking about it for days to figure out what to do,

758
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:14,723
but it gives me a headache. I have no idea what to do.

759
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:20,281
My father also said I should consult you first.

760
00:48:20,281 --> 00:48:22,479
You want my opinion?

761
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,899
You, my father, and I are the only ones

762
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:29,799
who know that we have five million dollars in the scholarship fund.

763
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:38,049
Are you saying I get to decide

764
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:41,069
who will receive the five million dollars?

765
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:42,935
That's right.

766
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,609
But how?

767
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:54,999
This is an untraceable phone.

768
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:59,829
I believe one phone call would do.

769
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:02,799
I hear the investigation unit has another suspect in custody

770
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:05,413
at the moment.

771
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,910
 Yoon, a law student at Minguk University, 

772
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,720
 was arrested on campus last night. 

773
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,819
 Yoon captured and killed a cat 

774
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,419
 in a brutal manner and was arrested 

775
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:20,250
 for violating the Animal Protection Act 

776
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,089
 and the Wildlife Protection and Management Act. 

777
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:24,189
 The police found a dozen other dead cats on campus 

778
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:26,189
 while inspecting the scene. 

779
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:28,200
 The police believe that they were also killed and abandoned by Yoon. 

780
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,730
 The police are also investigating whether or not 

781
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,239
 Yoon attempted to threaten the first witness. 

782
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:38,209
- My gosh, it's him. 
 - I know.

783
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,445
He has been arrested.

784
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,379
- That's horrible. 
 - It's awful.

785
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,810
It's so scary.

786
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,310
They're doing this on purpose.

787
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,350
   

788
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,390
 Guys, this country is so messed up. 

789
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,590
 So it's not Han Kang Baek? 

790
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,560
 Does this even make sense to you? 

791
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,636
 Yoon Gu Ryeong got arrested today. 

792
00:49:56,636 --> 00:50:00,500
 The Minguk law students suspected Yoon from the get-go. 

793
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,230
 He has such creepy eyes. 

794
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,100
 He really scares me! 

795
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,200
 I knew it. I told you, didn't I? 

796
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,908
 I told you, right? 

797
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:12,870
 This wasn't a crime of passion. 

798
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,879
 A psychopath did this. 

799
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:17,509
 Are the police trying to manipulate the case? 

800
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:18,980
 This is nuts. 

801
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,220
 Are they systematically trying to conceal the truth? 

802
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,819
 Do they think we're all idiots? 

803
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,095
 Guys, 

804
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:29,589
 I can feel Hong Nan Hee's resentment. 

805
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:32,629
   

806
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,160
 "Help me. This is so unfair! 

807
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,370
 Kang Baek killed me!" 

808
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,130
- Investigate the case properly! 
 - Arrest him!

809
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:46,709
   

810
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,009
   

811
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:49,279
   

812
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,699
   

813
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,628
This is...

814
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,249
This is illegal.

815
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:02,120
T-This is a pretext investigation.

816
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,872
This isn't a pretext until there is one.

817
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:10,123
You are under arrest for animal abuse.

818
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:14,819
Y-You also took my phone.

819
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:17,540
Isn't that what you're after?

820
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,644
You are

821
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,710
trying to frame me for Hong Nan Hee's murder.

822
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,609
We'll find that out after the investigation.

823
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:25,779
Not just Hong Nan Hee,

824
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:29,559
but do you know how much other victims are struggling mentally?

825
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:34,029
Consider yourself lucky you're not here for attempted murder.

826
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,339
That's because

827
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:40,851
I don't meet the conditions for imprisonment.

828
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,400
Don't try to threaten me.

829
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,630
You're the one who threatened others!

830
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,839
You're under arrest for animal abuse,

831
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,409
but in terms of attempted special intimidation,

832
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:54,209
we received an official report from the victim!

833
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:57,980
I never... I never threatened anyone!

834
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,280
That's why it's attempted!

835
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,259
I never attempted it!

836
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:05,750
You were holding the iron pipe!

837
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,819
You killed a cat with it, and that wasn't enough,

838
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:11,513
you killed Hong Nan Hee, and now more women!

839
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:13,690
Joong Jin.

840
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,840
What kind of law is this?

841
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,199
Do we have to wait until another person is hurt and dead?

842
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,185
Wang Joong Jin!

843
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,690
Yoon Gu Ryeong always gave me the chills.

844
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,359
I heard he went nuts after he flunked.

845
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:49,181
Did he really kill her?

846
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,000
It wasn't Kang Baek?

847
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,929
Yoon Gu Ryeong chased after Nan Hee so much,

848
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:54,339
almost like a stalker.

849
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:57,000
Geez. It's scary.

850
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,839
I know. Is he a psychopath?

851
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,409
I told you he was weird.

852
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:03,333
I knew something was off about him.

853
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:07,157
 Yes? 

854
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,699
 It's late. 

855
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:30,865
 - If it's not urgent, come back... 
 - Well... 

856
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,988
 Professor Na, 

857
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,869
 I... I need your help. 

858
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:41,954
 I think 

859
00:53:41,954 --> 00:53:46,176
 I'm going to be the suspect in Hong Nan Hee's murder. 

860
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:50,589
 Will you be my attorney? 

861
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,759
 I can't do that. 

862
00:53:56,759 --> 00:54:01,929
 - I know that but— 
 - Thank you for understanding. 

863
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:05,259
 I can introduce you to another attorney. 

864
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:10,710
 It has to be you. 

865
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,638
 No, you will have to. 

866
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,850
 What do you mean? 

867
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,834
 I saw it. 

868
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:27,723
 That night, Hong Nan Hee entered your room. 

869
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:37,624
 I think you killed her. 

870
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,015
 I guess it's true. 

871
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,164
 What are you saying? 

872
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,305
 We only talked. 

873
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:55,120
 Nothing happened. 

874
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,191
 That night, you had a fight. 

875
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,445
 I saw and heard everything. 

876
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:04,415
 No. 

877
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:09,047
 I knew it all along 

878
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:12,893
 about your relationship. 

879
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:16,909
 It's unfair. 

880
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:23,399
 I have to be the suspect instead of her boyfriend or paramour? 

881
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,439
 I can't be your attorney. 

882
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,064
 You have no choice. 

883
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:47,047
 What... 

884
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:48,509
 What are you doing? 

885
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:50,650
 You taught me 

886
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,179
 when a conversation is recorded by the person involved, 

887
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:54,449
 it's not against the Communication Act. 

888
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:57,311
 It also has admissibility. 

889
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:03,782
 If you refuse it, I'm going to submit this. 

890
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:10,914
 You admitted that you were with Nan Hee that night. 

891
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,833
 Bye. 

892
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:37,311
 There's another person who thinks you're the culprit. 

893
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,385
W-Wi...

894
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:58,301
Without my attorney, I refuse to undergo the investigation.

895
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,587
Can I have my phone back,

896
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:06,413
so I can make a call?

897
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:19,859
You can only call your attorney.

898
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,406
 Professor Na, 

899
00:57:47,406 --> 00:57:51,786
 you know it's not me. 

900
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:55,781
 Hurry up and set me free. 

901
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:57,753
 Professor Na. 

902
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,583
 Professor Na! 

903
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,948
Han Hye Ryul?

904
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,980



905
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,240
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

906
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,580
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

907
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,140
   

908
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,300
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

909
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,480
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

910
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:59,230
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

911
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,660
♫  It's a game of the tongue  ♫

912
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,780
♫  My heart is already on the floor  ♫

913
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,610
♫  Who will laugh at the end?  ♫

914
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:21,390
♫  On the shoulders of the giants  ♫

915
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,450
♫  Like a blooming flower  ♫

916
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:29,089
 She needs to go after Jusung in order to reach the highest place in Korea. 

917
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:32,659
 You want her to become the president, not Na Geun Woo? 

918
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:36,460
 I thought you owe Jusung a lot. 

919
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,699
 I will represent Yoon Gu Ryeong. 

920
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:41,727
 Did you kill her? 

921
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:43,299
 Make a fatherly decision. 

922
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:49,039
 Kang Baek will not be ruled out as a suspect until the thing involving my husband is all sorted out. 

923
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,179
 - I'm sorry. 
 - I want a divorce. 

924
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,150
 Na Geun Woo, this son of a gun. 

925
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,370
 I'm going to kill him. 

926
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,070
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫
