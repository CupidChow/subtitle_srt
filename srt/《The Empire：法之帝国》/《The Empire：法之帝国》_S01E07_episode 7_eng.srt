1
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:05,601
You should know.

2
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:07,751
Why is that?

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:12,364
Their goal is you.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,725
Didn't you mess with Dolphin?

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,996
According to Detective Ji,

6
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:21,394
that jerk instinctively knows how to protect himself.

7
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:22,594
He was born with that instinct.

8
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:25,324
"Don't mess with me. This is what happens to you."

9
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:28,104
He plans to make an example out of you.

10
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,901
Gosh! What an honor.

11
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:36,116
And I'm your fan.

12
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:37,944
Let me say this again.

13
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,675
I don't trust you.

14
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:41,275
But you trust Prosecutor Oh?

15
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,574
What do you mean?

16
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:45,514
You had him use me once.

17
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:48,184
The number of visits Dolphin made to the Prosecutors' Office.

18
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:52,706
Of course, I gained something from him as well.

19
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:55,654
Business and real life aren't the same.

20
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,638
I know how it is

21
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:01,554
and I must protect my favorite star.

22
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,314
Keep it a secret from Prosecutor Oh.

23
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,220
He is softhearted.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,618
If he finds out how many risks I take, he will be so shocked.

25
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,223
   

26
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,492
   

27
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:08,964
There's so much to cover for the midterm exam.

28
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,884
Personally, it's not fun for me at all.

29
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:17,286
Mr. Han Kang Baek,

30
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:21,545
can you think of a poem that can comfort this exhausted soul?

31
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:25,265
A poem that will give me a lot of energy to live my life.

32
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,339
"That is a wall.

33
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,854
When we feel there's an unclimbable wall,

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:39,386
ivies quietly climb the wall.

35
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:43,105
When we call it a wall of despair as it is without a drop of water,

36
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:46,865
and uninhabitable for a seed to grow,

37
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:51,072
ivies move forward without hurry.

38
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:53,415
No matter how small the progress is,

39
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:56,495
ivies always intertwine and climb up together.

40
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:00,845
Until the despair is completely covered in green,

41
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,533
they hold onto the despair and never let go.

42
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:10,320
When we drop our heads, thinking the wall is unclimbable,

43
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,372
a leaf of the ivy

44
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:17,203
leads thousands of ivy leaves

45
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:20,153
and climbs the wall in the end."

46
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:23,025
What do you think?

47
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,884
Is that enough to comfortâ€”

48
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,581
What's wrong?

49
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,675
Nothing.

50
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,915
I have dry eyes, as you know!

51
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,375
I'm disappointed.

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,764
I tell you everything, Nan Hee,

53
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,695
but you... have a lot of secrets.

54
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,425
That's just the image I'm creating.

55
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:53,147
A secretive woman with a lot of secrets.

56
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,735
You look like you're standing at a cliff.

57
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,700
Once I move in with you, I'll feel more stable.

58
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,784
If you're marrying me for my sake, you don't have to do that.

59
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:11,955
Why not? Do you not feel confident you can do this?

60
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,455
Gosh, you're such a nice son.

61
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,115
You don't want to go against your mother.

62
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,505
There's something you don't know.

63
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:22,604
My mom is the last person

64
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,894
to lecture me about this.

65
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,815
In the end, she will let me do what I want.

66
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,104
What do you mean?

67
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,744
It's about when she married my stepdad.

68
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,815
It was crazy.

69
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,678
She even left home with me.

70
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,115
She moved in with my stepdad right away.

71
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,285
She said she would live the rest of her life without my grandma

72
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,305
because she disapproved.

73
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,194
Your mom did that?

74
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:50,074
You can't believe it, right?

75
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:54,064
She said he was the only one for her and she loved him so much.

76
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,070
She cried her eyes out.

77
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,464
So...

78
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,286
don't do this for my sake.

79
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,604
You should put yourself first.

80
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:12,098
Let's get married.

81
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,064
That's putting me first.

82
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,155
   

83
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:23,402
Geun Woo, I'm counting on you. You know that, right?

84
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:27,842
Okay? I can count on you, right?

85
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:31,428
- Soo Hyuk. 
 - Yes.

86
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,905
I'm about to throw up.

87
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,774
Hey, hold it!

88
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,654
Hey, come here. Hold it!

89
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,098
Yes, Mom.

90
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,006
Yes, he's here.

91
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,904
No, I can bring him home.

92
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,995
Yes, yes.

93
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:06,434
Did your mom send you? Come on.

94
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,134
Some people might think that we got married

95
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,944
because we were madly in love.

96
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,244
Hey, Attorney Nam.

97
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:24,112
Hey, why is he acting so arrogant?

98
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,424
I thought it would be easy since his family was in debt.

99
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,695
Okay. I'll count on you, Attorney Nam.

100
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:32,424
For now, it might seem like the case is only worth 50,000 dollars

101
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:35,164
but if they lose, Jusung will lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.

102
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:38,052
That cannot happen.

103
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,203
All rise!

104
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,715
   

105
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,185
   

106
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:59,072
Please be seated now!

107
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:06,509
I will present my ruling now.

108
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:10,805
Considering the overall evidence presented

109
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,404
regarding the plaintiffs' experiences,

110
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:14,374
nature of their tasks, work environment,

111
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,375
health, and medical evaluations.

112
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,104
Due to constant exposure to harmful substances

113
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:22,274
of the plaintiffs from their work environment,

114
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,015
additional injuries and diseases caused,

115
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:28,514
or it is suitable to consider that this work environment accelerated

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,484
the diseases or injuries based on their experiences.

117
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,055
The causal relationship between

118
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:33,954
the nature of their job and the diseases and injuries

119
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,294
is recognized to a certain degree.

120
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,025
Hence, it's illegal

121
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:42,865
for the defendant not to compensate them by using a different premise.

122
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:48,412
Therefore, the plaintiffs' demand will be accepted by the court.

123
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,419
We won!

124
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,215
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

125
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:56,515
We won! Thank you.

126
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,215
We won!

127
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,454
The bus!

128
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,855
Wait!

129
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,495
   

130
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,030
Come on.

131
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,545
Did you even know how much the drinks cost there?

132
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:29,340
Why did you drink so much?

133
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,389
Mr. Han Gun Do was pretty angry.

134
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:34,214
Who are you?

135
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,714
Don't you know who I am?

136
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:38,226
Really?

137
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,981
Must I know you?

138
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,294
Well, hold on.

139
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:45,164
Talking to you like this in the car is hurting my neck.

140
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:48,664
Why don't you get in? Let me give you a ride home.

141
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,804
I went there thinking it was my colleague's birthday party

142
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,434
but Mr. Han was there.

143
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,715
I'll send you the money for the drinks.

144
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:04,985
That's fine,

145
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,600
I can cover it.

146
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,054
I don't want Ham &amp; Lee law corporation paying for my drinks.

147
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:14,094
I'm not from Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

148
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,325
Pardon?

149
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:18,005
Didn't you major in law at Seoul National University?

150
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:20,995
I did.

151
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:24,704
Well, it's embarrassing to bring this up myself.

152
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:28,274
Everyone who majored in law at SNU knew who I was.

153
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,874
Why? Because you're pretty?

154
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:35,815
If that were the case, it would've been great.

155
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,584
I married my senior, Prosecutor Ko Won Kyung,

156
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,728
at the age of 20 and then divorced him.

157
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,725
I was more famous

158
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:48,205
as Ham Min Heon's granddaughter and Han Gun Do's daughter.

159
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:52,414
You were pretty cool today.

160
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,065
 Hence, it's illegal 

161
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:58,704
 for the defendant not to compensate them by using 

162
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,778
 a different premise. 

163
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,848
 Therefore, the plaintiffs' demand will be accepted 

164
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,844
 by the court. 

165
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:13,993
 We won! We did it! 

166
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,390
I learned a lot.

167
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,355
I was only doing my job as I had been taught.

168
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,194
Well, so was everyone.

169
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,395
"Based on the Constitution, the law,

170
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:28,335
and the conscience of the judicial officer."

171
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,535
However, the problem was

172
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:34,035
that their conscience changed way too quickly in front of my dad,

173
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,522
but you were different.

174
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,783
Their food is really delicious.

175
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,924
Do you want some, then?

176
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,789
Can we?

177
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:05,942
   

178
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,394
You know what?

179
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:16,730
I'm not that different.

180
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,329
Pardon?

181
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,216
I was tempted like everyone.

182
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:26,599
Mr. Han Gun Do

183
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:31,156
knew exactly how to tempt people.

184
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:37,758
In other words, you have nothing to learn from me.

185
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,204
I'm thinking of resigning from my judgeship too.

186
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:44,384
The desire to live in comfort is already creeping in.

187
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,642
Aren't you Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul?

188
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,985
I just didn't know how you looked, but I've heard a lot about you.

189
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:56,889
Right.

190
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,474
I told you I was famous.

191
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:02,568
Prosecutor Han,

192
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,925
you're not famous just because of your divorce or your family's money.

193
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:12,133
People said they could tell you were a much bigger person,

194
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,508
and now I know that they were right,

195
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:21,390
so don't be so hard on yourself.

196
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:31,025
You don't know anything about that punk!

197
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,655
Don't say such things about him.

198
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,995
You don't know about his intention in approaching you.

199
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,664
You have no idea how evil he is! You don't know anything!

200
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:40,806
I told you not to say such things about him!

201
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:43,965
What do you know about him? How can you say that?

202
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,905
Is it his fault that he grew up in a poor family?

203
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:48,008
He's evil!

204
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,775
He can't be eviler than this family.

205
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,875
All that's left in this house is dishonesty and greed.

206
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:57,023
He can't be worse than this evil family!

207
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,345
Hey, you brat!

208
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,255
That guy definitely has problems.

209
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,054
Look what he did to you!

210
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,684
How can you say such things to your parents?

211
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,404
When did our daughter become so rude?

212
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:13,704
I will move out with Kang Baek.

213
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,252
I'm moving in with him.

214
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:19,562
I don't plan on seeing you guys again.

215
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,838
What did you say?

216
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,905
What on earth is she talking about?

217
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:27,305
I won't be with anyone but Na Geun Woo.

218
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,386
I...

219
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,688
I love him so much!

220
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,094
You can't marry Hong Nan Hee!

221
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,196
You won't even answer me now?

222
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:46,758
Are you even my son?

223
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,252
How could you change like this?

224
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:50,665
What on earth did she do to you?

225
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,834
- How could you change like this? 
 - It's not because of her!

226
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,816
Then who did this to you?

227
00:13:55,816 --> 00:14:00,419
If you want to place blame, it's you.

228
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,050
What? Is this because of me?

229
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,115
What on earth are you talking about?

230
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,254
Have you forgotten?

231
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:12,566
You moved out of the house with me to marry Dad.

232
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,794
If you continue to disapprove,

233
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:18,518
I'll move out and live with Nan Hee first.

234
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:23,266
- What? 
 - It won't change the fact that I plan to marry Nan Hee.

235
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:28,032
I just want my family's blessing when I marry her.

236
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,444
Kang Baek.

237
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,245
You already have a lot on your plate other than this.

238
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,125
Let me handle my own life.

239
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,604
Kang Baek,

240
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:43,855
I'm begging you!

241
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:46,494
Mom!

242
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:47,525
Get up!

243
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,520
Please,

244
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,724
do this for me.

245
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,595
Please?

246
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,383
Why do you hate her so much?

247
00:14:56,383 --> 00:15:01,204
You have no idea about her intention behind approaching you,

248
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,934
and how evil she is.

249
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:06,258
Please, Kang Baek! Please?

250
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:11,165
How can you say the same things Grandma said to you 20 years ago?

251
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:15,556
So was Grandma right?

252
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:19,205
Please stop saying those mean things about my girlfriend!

253
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:26,980
Dad.

254
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,570
Honey.

255
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,431
I...

256
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:01,883
I have something to say.

257
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,548
Why?

258
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,504
Are you going to tell me that you were seeing someone?

259
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:12,310
Is that so?

260
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,944
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:21,832
If that's not it, I'm not in any mood to listen to you.

262
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,295
 Professor Na, I thought you were so scared to be seen with me. 

263
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:43,599
 I can't believe you're here in person. 

264
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,559
 What if someone sees us together? 

265
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,764
 Why aren't you answering your phone? 

266
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,345
 I thought you wanted to break up with me. 

267
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:55,324
 Is that why you're doing this? 

268
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,996
 - But still, how could youâ€” 
 - Wait. 

269
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,225
 Are you here because of Kang Baek? 

270
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,194
 What does that have to do with you? 

271
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,594
 Nan Hee, I'm sorry. 

272
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:13,634
 - But still, Kang Baek isâ€” 
 - Then you won't break up with me? 

273
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,400
 Will you keep seeing me? 

274
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,795
 Will you break up with Prosecutor Han and marry me? 

275
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:22,734
 I thought so, 

276
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,545
 so you're sorry and just want to break up with me. 

277
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,349
 You just want me to leave you alone. Isn't that it? 

278
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,084
 What do you want me to do? 

279
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:34,402
 What can you do? 

280
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,054
 Do you have money? 

281
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:39,554
 You're just their son-in-law. It's not your money. 

282
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:45,198
 Mr. Na, it's already done. 

283
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:48,098
 I never wanted anything from you anyway. 

284
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,765
 A former judge, an elite lawyer, a law school professor, 

285
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,834
 a next-generation leader, and a presidential candidate. 

286
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,505
 Did you think I fell for your titles? 

287
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:59,084
 Of course, you're very attractive. 

288
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:06,504
 But I felt... bad for you. 

289
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:11,800
 I was sad to see you live your life under their control. 

290
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:16,722
 I thought I knew who you were. 

291
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,825
 I thought you were just lost because of the circumstances, 

292
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,565
 and that you wanted to do the right thing in the end. 

293
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:25,805
 How stupid of me. I was fooling myself. 

294
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,089
 I'm really sorry. 

295
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:33,310
 I thought I was comforting your soul 

296
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,958
 but you treated me like a mistress, as if I had been one all along. 

297
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,585
 You insulted me, darn it! 

298
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,084
 Nothing is going to stop me now, 

299
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,178
 so don't provoke me like this. 

300
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:53,340
 Nan Hee, please. 

301
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,995
 I know what I did wrong, 

302
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,064
 but please, 

303
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,070
 Kang Baek... 

304
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,158
 Are you jealous? 

305
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,600
 Don't be. 

306
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:12,112
 Wish your son happiness as his father. 

307
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,025
 Nan Hee! 

308
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,105
Reporter Yoon Eun Mi, the news embargo has been lifted.

309
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,704
Please tell us about this news.

310
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,345
Sure. This is about Christmas Fund.

311
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:19,444
Dolphin was known as the mastermind behind the fund.

312
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,184
Chairman Ji Joon Ki wrote this letter by hand in the cell.

313
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,754
According to this statement letter,

314
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:26,455
he  lobbied a wide range of people

315
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:29,525
from former and current politicians, police officers, and prosecutors.

316
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,025
It was quite shocking to find out that

317
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,264
he even entertained prosecutors

318
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:36,465
who were involved in the case at adult clubs;

319
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,304
through his lawyer, who used to be a chief prosecutor.

320
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:40,504
I see. On top of that, Chairman Ji said

321
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:42,304
this was only the tip of the iceberg,

322
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:44,504
and he planned to expose more people that received bribes from him.

323
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,805
Is that true that he plans to expose more people?

324
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,244
That's right.

325
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,715
Considering the targets of Chairman Ji's alleged lobbying

326
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:54,385
were prominent politicians and high-ranking officials,

327
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:58,254
the people he plans to expose must be quite influential

328
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:02,924
 in the legal and financial circles, according to my speculation. 

329
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,125
 Their goal 

330
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,998
 is you. 

331
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,965
 "Don't mess with me. This is what happens to you." 

332
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:15,345
 He plans to make an example out of you. 

333
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,745
 If the content of this statement is confirmed, 

334
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,345
 and if he does expose more people, 

335
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:23,788
 it will certainly affect politics and the overall socialâ€” 

336
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:29,715
It's just as Eun Mi said.

337
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,812
What? Are you disappointed?

338
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,900
Of course. I bet everyone wanted him as their source.

339
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,240
Prosecutor Ko's intel that helped him solve cases was nothing

340
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,346
compared to this.

341
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,275
I must not have taught you right.

342
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:51,271
You fell for that con artist's lies.

343
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,129
Here's Fraud 101.

344
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:57,074
You tell people what they want to hear,

345
00:22:57,074 --> 00:23:00,885
and Dolphin is conning the people who have been waiting

346
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,114
for a scandal like this.

347
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,754
I doubt he's lying.

348
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:06,485
It doesn't matter if he's lying or not.

349
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,725
Once he thinks there's nothing for him to gain,

350
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:11,094
he will change his stance without feeling guilty at all.

351
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:12,564
That's the problem.

352
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:13,764
What will you do then?

353
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:16,334
There's no proof. It all hangs on his statement.

354
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:19,035
Prosecutors can't be swayed by sly words like his.

355
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,635
We must investigate and find proof.

356
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,974
Okay. I was shortsighted.

357
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,414
People who have been mooching off the crumbs

358
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:31,545
will want to do anything to spit out the crumbs

359
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,993
if they can.

360
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,125
I surrender.

361
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,005
We can't beat that darn criminal.

362
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,321
Never.

363
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:47,877
He exposed a senior prosecutor as a warning,

364
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:52,035
and former prosecutor generals are being talked about now.

365
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:54,415
To be honest, I'm so scared.

366
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,164
- Let's pull out. 
 - Right.

367
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:01,075
The bigger the mess gets,

368
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,314
the tighter we must stay together.

369
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:06,615
The moment we let go of his hands,

370
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,685
he will bring up how we treated him with drinks and Chinese food.

371
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,414
Darn it. Really?

372
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,425
Treating criminals with food and drinks

373
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,924
in the Prosecutors' Office will be criticized more

374
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:17,464
than stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

375
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:21,582
It was only a while ago people demanded to abolish

376
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:22,466
the detainment protocol.

377
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,865
Is there proof?

378
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,064
Didn't we pay with cash? As a special activity fee?

379
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,575
Come on. You know better. I bet he wrote down everything.

380
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:32,175
Once they look into the security footage of nearby restaurants,

381
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:34,395
finding that will be a piece of cake.

382
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,815
We're already stuck with him,

383
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,494
so if we don't use him well,

384
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:43,168
it will be the end of us.

385
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,627
 That jerk? 

386
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:47,717
 He is crazy. 

387
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,465
 Not to give him control, 

388
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,975
 we must play him at his own game. 

389
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,334
- Good shot! 
 - Nice!

390
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,104
- Gosh, you hit it so far! 
 - Thank you.

391
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:07,344
Attorney Nam, you must have passed the bar with your golf skills.

392
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:08,875
Right. If that was the case,

393
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,585
I would have had a perfect win rate at trials.

394
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:13,385
Gosh. That sounds awesome.

395
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,405
Let's go!

396
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,385
You're certain the direction has changed, right?

397
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,955
It's more than that.

398
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:24,925
Everyone is talking about lobbying at the adult clubs.

399
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,865
Adult clubs, women, and lobbying.

400
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:28,735
Once these keywords hit the news, it's over then.

401
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,635
All right. Good work.

402
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:33,035
I owe you one.

403
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:37,502
Gosh. You hardly owe me anything. You're my VIP client.

404
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,530
I have a very long bill for you.

405
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,574
Goodness!

406
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,774
Come on. It's me.

407
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,834
I thought we were more than just business partners.

408
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:51,525
You should have known that I couldn't be accommodating

409
00:25:51,525 --> 00:25:54,737
the moment you used an untrustworthy jerk.

410
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,665
Gosh. Did you tell him that?

411
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:06,565
My neck was on the line too. I had to tell him what I knew.

412
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,917
Blaming other people is a bad habit of yours too.

413
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:19,814
Sir, here's a thing about golf.

414
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,854
Power isn't everything, you know?

415
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:24,794
Are you saying I have no power or the techniques?

416
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,148
I didn't mean it like that.

417
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:34,768
Come on. Where did my ball land?

418
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,875
The defendant is 20 years old.

419
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,455
 She was a college student who lived with her parents. 

420
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,215
 The defendant's father had always been strict. 

421
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,385
 When the defendant came home late or stayed out at night, 

422
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,885
 he punished her severely. 

423
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,276
 On the days he drank, it was worse. 

424
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:06,995
 One day, the defendant's father was found dead in the house. 

425
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:11,275
 Next to him was a bottle of soju with agricultural chemicals inside. 

426
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:15,534
 The first suspect was his wife, who found the body. 

427
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,334
 That's the defendant's mother. 

428
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:21,814
 The victim also assaulted his wife when he was drunk, 

429
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:24,645
 and the wife left home because of domestic abuse. 

430
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,005
 She and the victim weren't on good terms. 

431
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:30,702
 But the problem arose unexpectedly. 

432
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:32,784
 There were many life and accident insurance policies, 

433
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,532
 and the defendant was the beneficiary. 

434
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:38,364
 The combined insurance claim was 1.5 million dollars. 

435
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,524
 When the defendant applied for the insurance claims, 

436
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:44,704
 the insurance company suspected insurance fraud and reported her. 

437
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,964
 That's when the suspect changed 

438
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:49,674
 from the defendant's mother to the defendant. 

439
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:53,494
 Anyway, there was no evidence on the defendant's mother. 

440
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:58,344
That's when she made a confession that became a problem.

441
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,254
Right. That's it. That's when things went south.

442
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:03,155
The defendant

443
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:05,524
and the defendant's mother claimed they were the culprit.

444
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:09,044
Then what do you think the investigative agency did?

445
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:11,364
 They would say they were accomplices. 

446
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:12,564
 Right. 

447
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:14,995
 This confession was good news to the insurance company. 

448
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:17,335
 Since the defendant was involved in the crime, 

449
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:20,275
 they didn't have to give out the claim. 

450
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:24,104
This is a tragedy.

451
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,175
The defendant's mother passed away due to a chronic disease

452
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:27,975
when she was detained to be investigated,

453
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:30,255
but the defendant lost her father

454
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,624
and mother as well.

455
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,504
 I'll be very late or won't come home tonight. 

456
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,744
 I need to practice the mock trial contest for the last time. 

457
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:38,385
 Even if it's late, I want you to come home. 

458
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,460
 I'll try. 

459
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,346
 Leave Kang Baek alone for now. 

460
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:48,206
 I'm telling you not to add fuel 

461
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:51,324
 to his temporary emotions. 

462
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:06,715
 Are you with Hong Nan Hee? 

463
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:16,439
   

464
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,714
   

465
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:46,353
   

466
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,954
 Kang Baek is in the shower, Mother. 

467
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,684
 Should I tell him to come out? 

468
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:31,495
What do you think you're doing?

469
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:34,464
 Honey! Your mother called! 

470
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:38,050
What are you doing?

471
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,364
Kang Baek is not going home tonight.

472
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:41,905
He can't.

473
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,074
I won't let him.

474
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:45,680
Put Kang Baek on the phone now!

475
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:50,144
Hong Nan Hee!

476
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:18,011
Give me Hong Nan Hee's number.

477
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:21,235
Give me her number now!

478
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:23,956
What's the matter?

479
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,555
You're her adviser.

480
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,827
You know her number.

481
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,924
Kang Baek said he's not coming home tonight,

482
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:38,764
and he's with her in the hotel.

483
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,338
What?

484
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:45,942
But...

485
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:50,304
Kang Baek is not that type of guy.

486
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:54,010
Yes. That's the problem.

487
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,327
Call her yourself.

488
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:00,515
Now?

489
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:04,514
I called Kang Baek, and Hong Nan Hee answered his phone.

490
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:07,068
She said he was in the shower.

491
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,264
I told her to send him home.

492
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,494
She said she won't,

493
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,564
and she hung up on me.

494
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:19,464
She's not going to answer my phone,

495
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,702
so call her now.

496
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,528
Hurry up!

497
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:42,022
   

498
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,026
Honey!

499
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:03,300
Well, Ms. Hong.

500
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,994
Sor...

501
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,938
Sorry for calling you so late.

502
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:11,465
Ms. Han is next to you, isn't she?

503
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:17,914
Are you...

504
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,932
with Kang Baek right now?

505
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:25,205
Look, Professor Na.

506
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:28,205
Don't you think you crossed the line?

507
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,904
 You call a woman in the middle of the night 

508
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:32,074
 and ask whom she's with. 

509
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:34,532
 How rude is that? 

510
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,447
Well...

511
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,216
Send Kang Baek home now!

512
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:47,124
Kang Baek is not a child.

513
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:50,120
He is an adult.

514
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,565
What?

515
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,945
 You said you wouldn't show. 

516
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:58,160
Mr. Na is going to notice it.

517
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,874
Get a grip, Ms. Han Hye Ryul.

518
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:18,248
Ms. Hong, I'm sorry,

519
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,284
but no matter what happens,

520
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:27,002
I plan not to get you involved with my son.

521
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:31,465
As a parent, my love for my son

522
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:35,224
is my right and duty.

523
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:40,548
So, if you really care about Kang Baek,

524
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:43,396
you should give up now.

525
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:50,168
If I give up on Kang Baek, will you give up on Na Geun Woo?

526
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:59,264
Do you think that makes sense?

527
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:00,940
 Why not? 

528
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,934
If you really love and understand Kang Baek,

529
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:07,454
you should be able to give up on Na Geun Woo easily.

530
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:13,666
How rude.

531
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:19,082
Think about your bad manners for calling me at this hour.

532
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:20,614
Bye now.

533
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,684
How dare you!

534
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:37,802
She hung up on me again.

535
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,336
I will never forgive her.

536
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:46,099
How arrogant!

537
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:54,285
   

538
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:59,924
 In the first trial, only the defendant showed up 

539
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:02,772
 and agreed on all evidence. 

540
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,895
 I've found a motive case. 

541
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:10,738
 It happened 30 years ago before we were even born. 

542
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:15,304
 It's called Kim's father's murder. 

543
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:18,034
 At the time, it made the headline. 

544
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:21,714
 In 1990, they might have beaten her or didn't let her sleep 

545
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,314
 and forced her to confess. 

546
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:27,758
 We can't neglect the chance of planted evidence or forgery, 

547
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:32,025
 but in the contest, we can't interrogate the defendant or the victim. 

548
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,554
 They assumed the defendant agreed on the evidence 

549
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:37,474
 and considered the evidence admissible. 

550
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,795
 - So the point isâ€” 
 - Wait. 

551
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:42,119
 Give me a second. 

552
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,542
 If we get to the point now, 

553
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,905
 we'll have to stay up all night, right? 

554
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,480
 I'm really okay with that. 

555
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,949
 We're out of coffee or energy drinks. 

556
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:56,734
 Already? 

557
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,815
 - Fine. Let's take a break. 
 - Yes. 

558
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,284
 I'll go to the convenience store nearby. 

559
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,625
 Me too. 

560
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,436
 I'll go too. 

561
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:12,074
 Yes, go. I'll organize the data. 

562
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:15,435
 Oh, don't buy too much coffee or energy drinks. 

563
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:16,995
 You're a caffeine addict! 

564
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,665
 - Okay. 
 - Okay? 

565
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:20,105
 Yes! 

566
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:21,540
 Hey. 

567
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:25,275
 Do you need anything? 

568
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:28,058
 I'm good. 

569
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:31,275
 - My phone. 
 - Let's just go. 

570
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,685
 Are you expecting a call from your girlfriend? 

571
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,654
 Honey! I won't call you. Just hurry up! 

572
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:38,114
 Okay. I'll be right back! 

573
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:41,080
 - Watch the house! 
 - Okay. 

574
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:05,745
   

575
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:11,610
 Are you with Hong Nan Hee? 

576
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:19,282
   

577
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,680
 Kang Baek is in the shower, Mother. 

578
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:42,514
Is it true the prosecutors who were treated in the adult club

579
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,085
are investigating Christmas Fund?

580
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:46,525
Do you have any comment on the claim

581
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:48,594
that the former Chief Prosecutor prepared a meeting

582
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,855
in an adult club with prosecutors in active service?

583
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,424
Dolphin was summoned to the prosecution office

584
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,625
for more than 70 times.

585
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,694
It was just the other day when the prosecution service

586
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,304
promised to stop pacifying the prisoners illegally.

587
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:03,590
Do you still make deals with prisoners?

588
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,018
Han Hye Ryul.

589
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:13,585
Throw her out.

590
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,469
What about Ji Yi?

591
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,525
Are you worried about Ji Yi?

592
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:23,605
Are you expecting me to buy that?

593
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:26,295
That's not what I mean.

594
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:30,815
I'm asking if you considered all the circumstances.

595
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:33,505
You're good at upsetting people, aren't you?

596
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:37,474
Are you saying I don't consider all the circumstances?

597
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:40,174
I'm worried about Ji Yi so much.

598
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:41,775
Do you think you worry about her more than I do?

599
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,145
However, I'm about to go down!

600
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:47,884
If I go down, what about Ji Yi?

601
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:51,315
Besides, just because I mess Han Hye Ryul up,

602
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,795
that family won't even flinch.

603
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:57,025
Ji Yi is joining that family, not as Han's daughter-in-law.

604
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:00,689
So, even if we give him Han Hye Ryul,

605
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:03,435
it won't affect Ji Yi.

606
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:05,394
You said it yourself.

607
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,804
Let's take advantage of Dolphin.

608
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:11,180
Il, Han Hye Ryul?

609
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,719
She is never that easy.

610
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,438
If things go wrong...

611
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,014
Four prosecutors who were enjoying themselves with girls

612
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,904
in the private club got caught.

613
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:25,892
We have to prosecute someone.

614
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:27,955
Besides,

615
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:30,594
the former Chief Prosecutor's scandal broke out.

616
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,770
Guess who's next?

617
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:37,338
If it has to be someone on the active list, it's me.

618
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,304
Me.

619
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,015
I'm telling you for the last time.

620
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:50,410
Give him Han Hye Ryul.

621
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,219
We'll find out

622
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:57,258
whether she's easy or not.

623
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,878
   

624
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:08,565
Hello. This is Yoon Sung Gyu.

625
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:14,008
Today, we'll begin with MBS' exclusive.

626
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:18,475
Recently, the practical body of Christmas Fund,

627
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:20,704
Chairman Ji Joon Ki, also known as Dolphin,

628
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:25,144
disclosed treating current prosecutors

629
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:27,385
and the former Chief Prosecutor in the private club

630
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:30,924
via mail from prison and caused a big controversy.

631
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:35,525
Then, Chairman Ji implied an additional disclosure.

632
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:37,824
However, Chairman Ji suddenly reported to MBS yesterday

633
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:41,264
that his disclosure notice and letter from prison were never true,

634
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:45,505
and he was forced to make them under pressure and conciliation

635
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,304
by Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul

636
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:53,244
of Seoul Central District Prosecutor Anti-Corruption Office.

637
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:57,645
 Chairman Ji, is it true that you received unfair treatment? 

638
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:59,484
 Chairman Ji, is it true you had to wait for a long time 

639
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,685
 in the defendant's waiting room? 

640
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:06,625
Chairman Ji also revealed that if he does not comply

641
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,795
 with Jusung and the Blue House investigation, 

642
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,125
 he'll receive considerable disadvantages, 

643
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:17,308
 such as a special investigation and the max penaltyâ€” 

644
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:19,690
So that's what happens in the end.

645
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:25,322
The couple only talked about justice and fairness,

646
00:43:25,322 --> 00:43:28,304
but the professor-husband turns out to be cheating with his student,

647
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,518
and the prosecutor-wife

648
00:43:30,518 --> 00:43:34,788
has a headwind for blackmailing the con prisoner.

649
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:39,085
By the way, I have to say I'm jealous of the intercourse in the car.

650
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:40,768
What?

651
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:43,875
Have you never had intercourse in the car before?

652
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:48,048
Your life has been a waste.

653
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:50,716
Yes, that's kind of true.

654
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:54,364
I stopped my wife and her parents from ending up in prison,

655
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,674
but they don't know who got them their wealth

656
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:00,612
and divorced me overnight and abandoned me.

657
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:04,974
I didn't just waste my life. I'm an idiot.

658
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,322
Who can be more idiotic than I am?

659
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:11,984
The old man who tells everyone

660
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:14,284
I'm just a puppet son-in-law isn't enough.

661
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:17,125
A wife who's not scared of her husband.

662
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:22,264
A daughter who's trying to steal my position.

663
00:44:22,864 --> 00:44:28,724
They think I'm an idiot who has no clue.

664
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:34,922
Only if I get Ham &amp; Lee, then...

665
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:38,187
Hey.

666
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:40,724
You better hold onto the right person.

667
00:44:40,724 --> 00:44:43,784
I have nothing to hold onto.

668
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:47,654
I'm just a punk who cleans up after you.

669
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,192
Cheers.

670
00:44:56,364 --> 00:44:58,944
When is Hye Ryul coming home?

671
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:01,964
She said she is still at work. She is going to be late.

672
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:04,475
How can she be working on a day like this?

673
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:05,775
He is right.

674
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:08,815
He is worried about her so much that he can't even go to sleep.

675
00:45:08,815 --> 00:45:11,985
She should come home early and discuss it with us.

676
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:16,364
She should reassure the elder in the family.

677
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:21,455
She is probably struggling to come up with a plan.

678
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:24,518
What on earth is going on?

679
00:45:24,518 --> 00:45:27,095
There may be no evidence of what they said

680
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:30,364
but they must have proof to take that stand.

681
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:32,150
Yes,

682
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,934
so I am worried.

683
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:37,524
Did she go too far for her performance record?

684
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:43,272
I cannot say that is highly unlikely.

685
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:47,414
I did not notice because I've only seen her at home,

686
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:50,554
but I guess Hye Ryul is a prosecutor after all.

687
00:45:50,554 --> 00:45:53,385
A prosecutor you'd see in a movie.

688
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:56,594
It happens during the investigation.

689
00:45:56,594 --> 00:45:59,065
You don't know what criminals are like.

690
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:02,264
Still, the world has changed.

691
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,194
That's the problem.

692
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,864
That doesn't change the criminals!

693
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,754
They don't repent. They were born evil.

694
00:46:08,754 --> 00:46:12,251
How can they change when they can't be saved?

695
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,969
Father, I have something to say.

696
00:46:21,914 --> 00:46:23,862
Fine.

697
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:28,598
I don't know why Father and Daughter have so many secrets to say,

698
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:30,855
but I'm disappointed in you.

699
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,924
I don't mind having you around.

700
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,572
Mother,

701
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:41,764
it's not easy to speak ill of my husband.

702
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:45,804
If you really consider me as your mother,

703
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:48,304
that's the first thing you'd talk about without hesitation.

704
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:49,818
Don't you think?

705
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:53,422
In fact, it's about your husband.

706
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:57,078
I can't help but notice it.

707
00:46:58,085 --> 00:46:59,705
That's true.

708
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:01,696
I am sorry.

709
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:05,390
I will eventually feel closer to you.

710
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:09,006
Like I always say,

711
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:12,541
I have no other way to survive in this house,

712
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,065
except for you to live a long life.

713
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,489
Yes, I will.

714
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:21,782
You should hurry up.

715
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:31,415
Father,

716
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:34,848
this has something to do with Han Gun Do.

717
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:37,225
He is very clever this way.

718
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,805
Moo Ryul is immature and weak-minded.

719
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:42,964
She probably considers him a shelter and is swayed by him

720
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:44,864
without seeing the future,

721
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,964
and Attorney Nam is the bridge between them.

722
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,768
Attorney Nam is unreasonably greedy.

723
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:54,538
He got divorced for going after his wife's fortune.

724
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,458
Yes.

725
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:03,155
Both of them are not easy to deal with.

726
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:05,930
That's how we ended up here,

727
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,324
but now that they made up their mind to take over Ham &amp; Lee,

728
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:10,520
we cannot overlook.

729
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:13,030
Father,

730
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,634
you must not let go of Ham &amp; Lee.

731
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:24,534
That's how you can protect Mother and save my children.

732
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,282
That's the only way.

733
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,614
 When Chairman Ji did not comply, 

734
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:38,855
 she made him wait in the defendant's waiting room... 

735
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,355
- Darn wench. 
 -   For 10 hours... 

736
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:43,795
- Let's do this. 
  - Without any particular reason. 

737
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:47,725
 This waiting room is not cleaned or ventilated regularly, 

738
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,594
 and is very small and has no windows. 

739
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,964
 Chairman Ji, who suffers from claustrophobia, 

740
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:57,768
 - claims it affected his healthâ€”  
 - Dolphin, that jerk!

741
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:02,315
I told her so many times that she should be careful!

742
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,275
That's not like you.

743
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,114
It's true that Dolphin is a jerk,

744
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:07,944
but it's her fault for making a prisoner

745
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:11,654
wait in the waiting room for 10 hours without any reason.

746
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:14,725
You always said the prosecutors must get rid of such a custom.

747
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:15,924
What did you say?

748
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:20,264
Hey, do you think that's the same as this?

749
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:22,960
They are different,

750
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,404
but when you get involved with a jerk, it's always your loss.

751
00:49:26,404 --> 00:49:30,226
When you fight the poo, you're guaranteed to get dirty.

752
00:49:30,226 --> 00:49:33,505
Still, I never thought Han Hye Ryul would do that.

753
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:38,344
In other ways, she is a prosecutor down to her bones!

754
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:41,145
Hey, don't you feel bad?

755
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,114
Because we missed the executive member,

756
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,085
she might have pushed him too far.

757
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,184
How is that our fault?

758
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,304
You're acting strange.

759
00:49:49,304 --> 00:49:51,225
Are you into Han Hye Ryul?

760
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,605
- What? 
 - Look at that.

761
00:49:53,025 --> 00:49:56,364
No matter how pretty she is, she's married and has a child!

762
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:59,134
What on earth are you talking about?

763
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:00,605
I already have enough on my mind!

764
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:01,840
Seriously!

765
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:05,080
Geez.

766
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,643
I'll get you some coffee.

767
00:50:16,355 --> 00:50:17,585
- Yoon Eun Mi. 
   - Yes. 

768
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:18,785
Come here.

769
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:27,292
Be honest with me.

770
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,445
You knew about Han Hye Ryul's case, didn't you?

771
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:33,134
Tell me now.

772
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:36,505
Everyone knows the fund executives move onto you.

773
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:39,685
You knew, but you left it out on purpose, didn't you?

774
00:50:39,705 --> 00:50:41,245
I was working to check the facts.

775
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:42,745
Do you think this is a joke?

776
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,514
Can't you read the room?

777
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:46,784
Didn't you see the presidential candidate preference?

778
00:50:46,784 --> 00:50:48,415
If it's about Han Hye Ryul, you should even be counting

779
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:50,755
how many times a day she goes to the restroom.

780
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:52,554
This is huge!

781
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:54,784
How dare you drop it without my permission?

782
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,654
Then should I go ask her how many times a day

783
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,824
she goes to the restroom and how she feels after each time?

784
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,234
If I just wrote what those swindlers told me to write,

785
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:05,665
it'd be nothing but a tabloid story.

786
00:51:05,665 --> 00:51:09,065
Since when did everyone trust those swindlers so much?

787
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,835
Everyone is swayed or confused by what they say.

788
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,263
Stop, that's enough.

789
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:17,984
What can you bring me? What's your conclusion?

790
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:23,255
A counter-argument for the MBS headline, and the plan to handle it.

791
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,014
I'll interview her and get it directly from her.

792
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:27,525
Even the people around her are keeping their lips sealed.

793
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:29,255
Everyone's going nuts, trying to interview her.

794
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:32,694
Do you really think she'll talk?

795
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:35,694
I am sure she'll talk if I'm the one asking.

796
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,874
Senior, you're alive, right?

797
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:55,332
I'm dead. Why do you ask?

798
00:51:55,332 --> 00:51:57,284
Why didn't you answer my calls?

799
00:51:57,284 --> 00:52:00,412
What? Did you call?

800
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:03,394
   

801
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:05,708
Of course, I called you.

802
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,015
I see.

803
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:11,595
The phones were ringing off the hook,

804
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:16,434
so I unplugged my office phone and put my cell phone on silent.

805
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,575
I was worried.

806
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:20,105
Hey, if you were worried thinking I might be dead,

807
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:21,575
why didn't you check in on me sooner?

808
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,715
I figured you probably had a headache and wanted to rest up.

809
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:25,414
Why would I have a headache?

810
00:52:25,414 --> 00:52:28,458
I told you that we should just surrender.

811
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,730
What? This situation is utterly ridiculous.

812
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,580
How could you...

813
00:52:34,255 --> 00:52:39,059
Don't tell me you saw this coming.

814
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,194
Why is it ridiculous?

815
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:45,810
It's a fact.

816
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:50,605
It's true that Dolphin got out because I called him that day.

817
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:56,314
I deliberately messed with him, so he was stuck in that room all day.

818
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:58,115
It's all true,

819
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:01,014
and if I say it's what prosecutors do when investigating a case,

820
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,855
I'll be bashed.

821
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:06,355
So all things considered, I've got nothing to say.

822
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:07,624
What's true?

823
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:10,354
We never threatened anyone. We were threatened if anything.

824
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,925
Do you have evidence?

825
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:14,785
Can you prove that we never threatened anyone?

826
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:16,817
Don't be such an amateur.

827
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:20,558
Prosecutor Oh, the damage has already been done.

828
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:24,834
Now, we must make a choice and decide how we'll get through this.

829
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:29,664
We must be strong and brave.

830
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:35,227
You can push ahead with it even if I'm gone, right?

831
00:53:35,227 --> 00:53:37,982
Stop. You're scaring me.

832
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,704
Professor Na should really pick you up today. Isn't he coming?

833
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:50,134
You see, this is really nothing.

834
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:53,164
There are worse things. Things that would make your head split in half.

835
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:57,016
They're all around you, like mines waiting to explode.

836
00:53:57,016 --> 00:54:00,786
So this is just something...

837
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:12,615
It's just something I should get through.

838
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:29,534
- Senior. 
 - Yes.

839
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:31,980
- Are you done? 
 - Almost.

840
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,374
- Hurry up and finish it. 
 - Goodness.

841
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:37,045
- Just put it in your mouth. 
 - Okay. My goodness.

842
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:39,814
- Hey, run! 
 - Wait!

843
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:43,172
   

844
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:46,184
Ms. Han Hye Ryul!

845
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:48,324
They say you blackmailed and cajoled Chairman Ji,

846
00:54:48,324 --> 00:54:51,195
in an attempt to obtain statements that could work against Jusung

847
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:54,295
and the Blue House. Do you have anything to say about it?

848
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:56,564
I never provided convenience to a prisoner

849
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,534
or offered preferential treatment, which is illegal.

850
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:00,135
I never abused my authority

851
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,722
or broke the rules while investigating any case.

852
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,235
- That witch! 
  - I will not tolerate... 

853
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,804
- She's talking about us, right? 
  - Any attempts to meddle 

854
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,105
 in the investigation. 

855
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,215
 I'd like to emphasize once again that there will be no compromise. 

856
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:12,345
That crazy woman!

857
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:14,585
 - A fair, transparent investigation.  
 - What's she saying now?

858
00:55:14,585 --> 00:55:16,914
 - It's my duty as a prosecutor.  
 - How dare she talk so confidently?

859
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,584
Is she announcing her candidacy for president?

860
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:19,925
 I will conduct the investigation, 

861
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:23,454
 - fair and square.  
 - That's Han Hye Ryul.

862
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:25,594
She changed the frame to change the game.

863
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:28,965
You fool! Did you smirk just now? Seriously?

864
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:30,295
Wait and see!

865
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:33,704
I'll make sure that crazy woman is reprimanded.

866
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:36,034
  - Everyone is hugely disappointed...  
 - You just watch.

867
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:39,744
 In the prosecution due to the power struggles within the organization. 

868
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:42,676
Can you please comment on that?

869
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,275
A world where a mere prosecutor like myself

870
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,314
can never cause all this trouble for reporters

871
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:50,014
and is rarely mentioned in the news.

872
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,754
That's the kind of world I truly wish to build.

873
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:56,155
A world where people can watch a good movie

874
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:59,695
or read a good book, instead of watching the news, to end their peaceful day.

875
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:04,295
I will work harder so we can all live in such a world.

876
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:08,844
I'm sorry for the trouble and for keeping you waiting until so late.

877
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:28,964
Just a comment, please.

878
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:12,960



879
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:19,010
   

880
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,860
â™«  I raise my hand slightly, Iâ€™m walking carefully  â™«

881
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:34,020
â™«  See myself walking as if on glass that is about to break  â™«

882
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:41,570
â™«  If I take one step backwards  â™«

883
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:48,310
â™«  The dream that is about to crumble traps me  â™«

884
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:57,820
â™«  The one who keeps coming closer, that sad man  â™«

885
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,000
â™«  Where did this all start?  â™«

886
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,534
 I'm glad this is working in your favor. 

887
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:05,834
 This absurd act shouldn't bury her wrongdoing! 

888
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:08,244
 Maybe she should really run for president later on. 

889
01:00:08,244 --> 01:00:11,014
 Facts will always backfire on you. 

890
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:13,284
 Forget about revenge and money. 

891
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:15,044
 I can't sleep in the same bed with him anymore! 

892
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,755
 Thank you so much, Professor Hwang. 

893
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:19,485
 Does Kang Baek know what you're up to? 

894
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:22,054
 What are you going to do? Do you have proof? 

895
01:00:22,054 --> 01:00:24,355
 Do you realize what you're doing now? 

896
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:27,824
 How come all the third-generation conglomerates are so predictable? 

897
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,564
 That brazen wench! 

898
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:33,250
 She is asking to get killed. 

899
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:38,570
â™«  Of course, you didnâ€™t know you would come crashing down weakly  â™«
