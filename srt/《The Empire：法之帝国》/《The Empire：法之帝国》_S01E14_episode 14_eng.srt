1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,811
   

2
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,020
   

3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:27,010



4
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,780
Sorry. I'll wash up quietly and go to bed right away.

5
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:39,943
Hyun.

6
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:42,138
Are you mad? Are you?

7
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:44,478
You reek of alcohol.

8
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,222
Sorry.

9
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:49,178
Why did you have a drink? It's not like you.

10
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,141
For nothing.

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,349
I felt so frustrated

12
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:58,149
that I thought drinking would make me feel better,

13
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,939
but then, it's not really helping.

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,406
Sorry.

15
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,402
Sorry.

16
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:11,177
Did you break up?

17
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,775
What?

18
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:20,288
Did you break up with him? Is it over between you two?

19
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,366
What did you just say?

20
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,939
I think you did the right thing.

21
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,648
It wasn't going to work anyway.

22
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:32,088
It's right to break up, especially in the current situation.

23
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:35,288
You don't want to get involved and be suspected as well.

24
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,157
Hey, you...

25
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:42,012
Since when...

26
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:46,103
I have feelings for Ji Yi,

27
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:50,592
but just like how Ji Yi looks at Kang Baek,

28
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,908
he looks at you.

29
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,678
And you can be quite sloppy.

30
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:01,339
It's so easy to see through you as a roommate.

31
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,688
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

32
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:07,305
I'm not that low.

33
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:14,022
What I want to know is this.

34
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,638
You met Kang Baek that day, didn't you?

35
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,933
Just what happened that night?

36
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:29,008
   

37
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,793
 - How about Sokcho? 
 - What? 

38
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,454
 Let's go on a trip. 

39
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:38,299
 We'll go there, appreciate the sea, have delicious food, 

40
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,612
 and walk hand in hand. 

41
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:48,369
 All right. We won't hold hands, but walk side by side instead. 

42
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,405
 Is that okay? 

43
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,735
 - I'm sorry. 
 - No. 

44
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,709
 I don't want you to feel uncomfortable. 

45
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,887
 What should we eat in Sokcho? 

46
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,442
 It has so many delicious restaurants there. 

47
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,314
 Even this? 

48
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,389
 Should we ride a cable car? 

49
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,183
 What do you think... 

50
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,545
 What's wrong? 

51
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,744
 I... 

52
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,579
 I need to go. Something came up at home. 

53
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,285
 I'm sorry. 

54
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,917
 What is it about? 

55
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,796
 Kang Baek! 

56
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,689
 Kang Baek, what about your car keys? 

57
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,136
 What? 

58
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,729
 - Can you drive in this state? 
 - I can. Give me the keys. 

59
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,561
 - Kang Baek. 
 - Now! 

60
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,908
 I'll drive instead. 

61
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,164
 Stay out of it! 

62
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,122
 Don't wait for me. 

63
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,723
Nothing happened.

64
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,448
We just...

65
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:21,862
We just stayed together all night.

66
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,349
As if. Don't you remember?

67
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,258
You came back at dawn that day.

68
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:30,183
Usually, you come back around noon.

69
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:34,503
Something was different that day, no?

70
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:35,939
No.

71
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,079
I wasn't feeling well.

72
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,949
That's why I came back early.

73
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,829
I didn't want to cause any suspicions.

74
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:54,519
When you lie, you make it too obvious.

75
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,753
Come in.

76
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,613
I will... Kang Baek...

77
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,854
He will be all right.

78
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,758
I'll make sure he will be.

79
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,918
So honey,

80
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,815
take care of him first, no matter what happens tomorrow.

81
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,279
Of course, I will.

82
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,064
Kang Baek, are you awake?

83
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,159
I'm coming in.

84
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,275
Let's visit your grandma before you get investigated.

85
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:48,155
Mom, Kang Baek and I are here.

86
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:52,059
Your beloved eldest grandson, I mean.

87
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:57,962
He's eating well, sleeping well, and studying hard.

88
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,819
Should you lie to someone dead?

89
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,689
I'm eating well, sleeping well, and studying hard too.

90
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,129
So don't worry.

91
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,143
Grandma.

92
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,549
I'll stop going to school.

93
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,229
I won't be able to come here for the time being.

94
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,774
Actually, for a long time.

95
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:27,997
Still, I'll try to eat and sleep well.

96
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,514
I hope you rest in peace too.

97
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:36,534
Thank you for adoring me.

98
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,719
Because of Father...

99
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:43,539
I know you were good to me because you were worried about him.

100
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,744
Still, I felt the warmth.

101
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,393
I liked you too.

102
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,809
You're underclothed.

103
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:14,132
It's okay. I'm not cold.

104
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,653
Kang Baek, should we take a seat for a moment?

105
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,328
Okay.

106
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,749
Kang Baek.

107
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:46,419
I know you didn't kill Nan Hee.

108
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:52,845
What I don't know is why you're lying.

109
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,862
I killed Nan Hee.

110
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,896
That's the truth.

111
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:03,775
Will you say that to the police today?

112
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,345
Yes.

113
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:14,962
Why? Why did you kill her?

114
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,219
What?

115
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:21,143
They'll obviously ask you this. How will you answer?

116
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,976
I'm going to accompany you anyway, so tell me.

117
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,578
My girlfriend cheated on me.

118
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:36,173
How did it happen?

119
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:40,979
Someone let me know about her affair,

120
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,948
so I met her and pried into it on campus at night.

121
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:47,808
She admitted it, and I killed her out of sudden anger.

122
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:53,762
Who let you know about it and how?

123
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:56,418
I won't answer this one.

124
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:59,980
How did you kill the victim?

125
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:08,404
Kang Baek.

126
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,545
I...

127
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,449
I killed Nan Hee.

128
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:24,339
I was having an affair with her.

129
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:29,362
I deceived you, your mom, Kang Ye, and everyone else.

130
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:33,641
She said she'd expose our relationship.

131
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,568
Father.

132
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,715
I'm not like you.

133
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:43,974
I have a clear motive that can be proven,

134
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,609
and I know how she was killed.

135
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:48,278
Of course, because I killed her.

136
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,879
- You're lying. 
 - I'm going to turn myself in.

137
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,526
Father.

138
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,983
No, you didn't do it.

139
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:00,221
That's the truth.

140
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:05,228
The one who killed Nan Hee was Mom.

141
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:09,768
   

142
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,444
 What are these pictures? 

143
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:16,029
 Say something. 

144
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,953
 How could you do this? 

145
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:22,907
 How could you do this to me? 

146
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:27,820
 No, how can you be this subhuman? 

147
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,833
 Why? 

148
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,398
 Just why did you go this far? 

149
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,865
 Because I couldn't win. 

150
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:45,232
 It was already a losing game from the start for me. 

151
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:48,778
 I thought tripping them would make them lose with me. 

152
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,240
 What are you talking about? 

153
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,041
 Just why did you do it to my family and me? 

154
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:58,719
 You were always confident and strong. 

155
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,918
 I told everyone I wanted to be cool like you. 

156
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,278
 So how could you do this to me? 

157
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,238
 Kang Baek. 

158
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,022
 You keep commending me. 

159
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,829
 Are you proud of me 

160
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,699
 because I don't give up even when I had nothing, 

161
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,228
 including parents that everyone else has? 

162
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,569
 - That's not what I mean. 
 - Then why do you say I'm confident? 

163
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:22,469
 Why do you say I'm strong and cool? 

164
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:25,321
 Every time you say so, I think, 

165
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:30,302
 "Even others can see that my life's hard." 

166
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:34,352
 "They think I'm pathetically struggling to get by." 

167
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,788
 I wouldn't feel this miserable even if people looked down on me. 

168
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,361
 You know that? 

169
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:43,718
 Are you saying you did it because of me? 

170
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:47,433
 No, that's not what I mean. 

171
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,667
 I had no other choice. 

172
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:56,559
 It's not like 

173
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,845
 I wanted to do this. 

174
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,178
 I didn't have the luxury of having options. 

175
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:05,949
 That's what I'm saying. 

176
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,285
 You didn't want to do it? 

177
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,577
 What are you saying? 

178
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:15,025
 No, forget it. 

179
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,222
 You don't have to answer. 

180
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:18,821
 Just... 

181
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:23,608
 Can't you just stop here? 

182
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,605
 Please. 

183
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,907
 Please! 

184
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,009
 If I stop here, 

185
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,888
 I will end up dying. 

186
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,095
 Then die. 

187
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,293
 Die! 

188
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,942
 Kang Baek! 

189
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,012
 You ended up 

190
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:10,650
 hurting my Kang Baek too. 

191
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,548
 Mom, 

192
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:15,104
 were you aware of it? 

193
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,908
 About Father and Nan Hee... 

194
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,451
 Since when? 

195
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,796
 Since when? 

196
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,327
 How... 

197
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:32,154
 How could you bear such emotions? 

198
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,144
 Why? 

199
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,207
 For what? 

200
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,745
 Kang Baek. 

201
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,593
 This was 

202
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,099
 the best way to protect us. 

203
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,032
 Mom, 

204
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:56,237
 was it because of me? 

205
00:14:57,628 --> 00:15:00,192
 Because I went out with her. 

206
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,254
 Because I wanted 

207
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:07,500
 to marry her without knowing any of this. 

208
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,294
 Go home. 

209
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:27,148
 - Mom. 
 - Do you have anything left to say 

210
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:30,702
 to Hong Nan Hee or me? 

211
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,056
 Go home. 

212
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,082
 Now! 

213
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,596
 Like Kang Baek said, 

214
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,783
 I need you to die for real. 

215
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:13,503
Then the next day,

216
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,106
Nan Hee was found dead.

217
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,220
That's not enough to be sure.

218
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,096
Kang Baek, your mom didn't do it.

219
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:32,915
Mom knew about your relationship with Nan Hee.

220
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:37,493
She knew it all and she kept it hidden for me,

221
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:40,148
but that day,

222
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,599
her effort turned to nothing.

223
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,482
Kang Baek.

224
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:48,956
Mom killed Nan Hee because of me.

225
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:51,439
I should've told her, but I couldn't!

226
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,306
So Mom...

227
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,334
I was scared.

228
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,878
I was too scared!

229
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,988
Had I told her, things would've been different.

230
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:07,828
I'm sure of it.

231
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,722
Tell her what?

232
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:37,140
♫  Someone reflected weakly in the window  ♫

233
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,080
♫  Who could that person watching me be?  ♫

234
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:53,450
♫  Even if I ask multiple times, they just mirror the shape of my lips  ♫

235
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:01,700
♫  Just a sad, mysterious smile  ♫

236
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,590
♫  My shadow tramples desires  ♫

237
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,000
♫  Pierrot stood on a string at the end of the world  ♫

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,030
♫  Like walking on the threads of fate, like wavering at a ragged breath  ♫

239
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:35,010
♫  My image has been replaced by despair  ♫

240
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,278
♫  Fire-like love  ♫

241
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:41,778
Dad, what are you thinking?

242
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,757
Open the door, Dad!

243
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,640
Open the door!

244
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,973
Dad, what are you thinking?

245
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:53,146
It was because of me.

246
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,588
Not anyone else.

247
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,569
Especially not you.

248
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,069
Dad, no. Please...

249
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:03,393
No, Dad!

250
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,638
Try not to catch a cold.

251
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:09,402
Dad! Dad!

252
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:11,712
Live a happy life, Kang Baek.

253
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,593
Not a good life,

254
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,989
but a happy life.

255
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,488
Dad. Dad!

256
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:22,545
I'll take care of the rest.

257
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,659
Dad!

258
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,542
Dad!

259
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,341
Dad!

260
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,310
♫  The hot love that has passed  ♫

261
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:47,630
♫  Jumps in my heart as if it were still alive  ♫

262
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:58,750
♫  Leave it behind and go, let go of lingering affections  ♫

263
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,729
Arrest Han Kang Baek, the murderer!

264
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,828
- Arrest him! Arrest him! 
 - Arrest him! Arrest him!

265
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,738
Reveal the truth behind the murder case!

266
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,742
- Reveal the truth! Reveal the truth! 
 - Reveal the truth! Reveal the truth!

267
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,109
Save Hong Nan Hee's soul!

268
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,420
-  Save her! Save her! 
 - Save her! Save her!

269
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:23,230
♫  The love  that I miss and have missed?  ♫

270
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,470
♫  Like wildflowers wilt and bloom in the field  ♫

271
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,390
♫  I hope that the love that I missed  ♫

272
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:57,990
♫  will bloom again in that place  ♫

273
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,899
Kang Baek!

274
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,536
Kang Baek. What happened?

275
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,041
Oh, no. My precious grandson!

276
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,949
What happened to you?

277
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,689
You can tell me what happened. What happened?

278
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,168
My gosh! Kang Baek!

279
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,889
Oh, no! What happened to you?

280
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,588
I thought you were having the interview at the police station.

281
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,058
- Mother. 
 - You're all soaked.

282
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:43,230
Kang Baek, where's Professor Na?

283
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:47,498
Mother, we should let him wash up and get changed first.

284
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:49,708
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

285
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,753
No. Answer them first!

286
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:55,122
What on earth happened to you?

287
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,633
How much longer must we put up with your tantrum?

288
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,389
Father.

289
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,818
He doesn't want to practice law because you coddle him so much,

290
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,129
and he's talking nonsense like he wants to be a writer.

291
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,889
Father, please.

292
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,956
Where's Geun Woo?

293
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,866
I asked where Geun Woo was!

294
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:18,669
- You should answer him now. 
 - Honey!

295
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:19,938
Father is right!

296
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,610
He caused everyone to worry. He hasn't done anything right.

297
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,317
Dad...

298
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,792
Kang Baek!

299
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,657
Are you all right?

300
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:35,258
- Dad... 
 - Yes, I heard.

301
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:40,288
We can solve this one at a time.

302
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:43,366
Mom, did you already know?

303
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,662
Was this all part of your plan?

304
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:51,469
No.

305
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,128
Then explain it to me. What is this?

306
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:56,768
You have already heard about what happened.

307
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,748
Dad turned himself in for Nan Hee's murder.

308
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:02,948
You probably got a call by now that he was arrested.

309
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,548
Am I wrong?

310
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,849
Calm down.

311
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,349
But you still rushed over to see me first

312
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,976
because you knew everything.

313
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,728
Whatever I do or say,

314
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,728
I won't be going to prison because I'm carrying on the bloodline!

315
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,758
What is this about?

316
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:23,998
Dad got arrested for murder?

317
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,098
Go to your room.

318
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,468
- I'll explain it later. 
 - Where's Dad?

319
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:32,109
I don't want to hear it later! Where is Dad, Mom?

320
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,878
- Kang Ye. 
 - Are you happy now?

321
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,349
You never liked Dad!

322
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,078
Now that he has taken Kang Baek's place for the murder, are you happy?

323
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,303
What's gotten into you?

324
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,175
Is that true?

325
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:48,529
I just got the call and came here.

326
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,389
He was arrested an hour ago.

327
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,637
But you still came here?

328
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:57,669
You're something else too. Are you giving up on Na Geun Woo?

329
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,738
We should stop the press first.

330
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,609
Arrest the vice chairman of Jusung as planned.

331
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,838
Expedite it.

332
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:09,466
Gosh. Isn't he your son-in-law?

333
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,349
Sometimes, you can be too harsh.

334
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,278
It's like only Hye Ryul is your daughter.

335
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,449
Right. Unbelievable.

336
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,232
Dad didn't murder Nan Hee.

337
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,687
The murderer is in this family.

338
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:28,513
Dad did this because he wanted to protect me.

339
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:35,350
- He had to protect me because I... 
 - You didn't kill Hong Nan Hee!

340
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,738
I'm gay.

341
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,094
Kang Baek.

342
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,828
That's why I couldn't tell you where I had been.

343
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,988
That's enough!

344
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:00,399
I was with my boyfriend that night!

345
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,498
I told you to stop!

346
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:05,599
"Stop talking" won't change the fact that I'm gay!

347
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,909
If it was that simple and easy to change who I was,

348
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:11,549
I would have changed long ago,

349
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,533
because I was desperate to change!

350
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:17,818
I desperately wanted to change

351
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:21,143
and be just like everyone else,

352
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:26,149
but I couldn't change it,

353
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,189
no matter how hard I tried.

354
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:30,953
You probably didn't try hard enough.

355
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:35,028
I'll call your pastor. We can fix your homosexuality.

356
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,013
No.

357
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,130
I won't do it.

358
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,768
You don't get to make a unilateral decision.

359
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:40,969
Was there ever a time

360
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,508
I could make a unilateral decision in this house?

361
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,425
Homosexuality ruined him.

362
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:48,448
It would have been better if you were a murderer.

363
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,278
Arrest Han Kang Baek!

364
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,375
- Arrest him! Arrest him! 
 - Arrest him! Arrest him!

365
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:33,068
It was so creepy.

366
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:34,859
You saw him when he was making his statement, right?

367
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,999
He didn't display any sign of guilt earlier.

368
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,599
He pretended to be a righteous man,

369
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,599
and talked about justice and human rights.

370
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,469
He's a total psychopath.

371
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,469
You requested the arrest warrant, right?

372
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,298
Yes. It can't be undone now.

373
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:49,538
She threatened him with revealing their affair.

374
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:50,838
That's enough motive.

375
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:52,939
He said he wounded her on the forehead.

376
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,008
It healed, but he had a bite mark on the back of his hand

377
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:56,409
from Hong Nan Hee.

378
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,748
He said he murdered her with an iron pipe,

379
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,119
which matches the autopsy report.

380
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,879
The medical examiner said

381
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:05,988
the wound on her forehead and the iron pipe could be irrelevant.

382
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:07,558
He knew about the murder weapon

383
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,288
because he represented Yoon Gu Ryeong,

384
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:13,798
so he could have figured out that an iron pipe was used.

385
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,262
More importantly, we need to know where he dumped the iron pipe,

386
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,147
but he wouldn't tell us that.

387
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,024
Gosh, that...

388
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,887
Right. Why wouldn't he tell us?

389
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:32,478
Besides, he was flustered, so he threw the body into the lake?

390
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,349
He gives lectures at the university.

391
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:37,248
He must know how bright the lake gets during the day

392
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:39,618
and how many people walk past it.

393
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,850
It makes no sense that he didn't know.

394
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,000
Something is off.

395
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,462
   

396
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,429
What's this about?

397
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:26,881
Hye Ryul, how's Kang Baek? Is he all right?

398
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:32,009
I don't know.

399
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,909
 What's going on? 

400
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,808
Why did Na Geun Woo turn himself in?

401
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:38,448
What on earth is he thinking?

402
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,918
Do you think I calculate my every move?

403
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,802
Do you think I know everything?

404
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:46,389
I don't know either!

405
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:48,588
I know nothing!

406
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:51,849
 And that's driving me crazy! 

407
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:54,338
Hye Ryul, calm down.

408
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:57,998
So was it Na Geun Woo? Did he really kill her?

409
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:00,703
- What? 
 -  I'll be direct. 

410
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:04,756
Is there evidence that makes him the murderer? Or...

411
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:09,482
Na Geun Woo...

412
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,057
He just did it for Kang Baek,

413
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,778
 to protect Kang Baek. 

414
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:18,211
So he just took the fall? That makes no sense!

415
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:21,282
That complicated things on my end!

416
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:24,959
 This could have gone away once Kang Baek married Ji Yi. 

417
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,907
 Hye Ryul. Listen carefully. 

418
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:31,068
Kang Baek cannot get tied to Hong Nan Hee anymore!

419
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,399
 To do that, we need to save that jerk too, 

420
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,359
 whether we likes it or not. 

421
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,548
Now, there's only one thing we can do.

422
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:41,844
This is it.

423
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:50,619
What on earth is going on?

424
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,488
Why did he suddenly confess to the murder?

425
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:57,389
No. This would've been so funny if this didn't concern me.

426
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:01,129
Now that it's in my hands, I don't know what to do.

427
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:04,568
- Jang Il! 
 - You know, I can't...

428
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:09,892
Yes. No.

429
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,322
I get it.

430
00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:15,439
I can clearly see what's going on now.

431
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,078
I'll call you later.

432
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,909
Okay!

433
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:20,892
   

434
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,003
What's this about?

435
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:29,273
I need to talk to you about Na Geun Woo.

436
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,259
I don't know what happened.

437
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,513
Isn't it obvious?

438
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:37,582
It's going downhill.

439
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,008
Did you know about this?

440
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:48,508
No. Never.

441
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:50,329
Look at this punk.

442
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,718
This isn't what you promised.

443
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,748
This is a breach of good faith.

444
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:56,232
Jang Il.

445
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,809
I told you not to call me by my name.

446
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,783
I told you not to drop your honorifics. Remember?

447
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:08,558
You want my daughter to marry into a murderer's family?

448
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:10,627
Darn you!

449
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:14,639
Just to cover up a suspicion that wasn't enough to arrest him?

450
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,569
You little... Get up. On your feet.

451
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,338
Don't be a baby and get up.

452
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,287
- Gosh. 
 - Sir.

453
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,038
I made an offer that would help everyone.

454
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,833
What?

455
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,690
An offer?

456
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,311
An offer?

457
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,659
Did you say it was an offer, you scumbag?

458
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,158
Look at this jerk.

459
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:39,298
Since when did a threat turn into an offer? You scumbag!

460
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,629
When did a threat become an offer?

461
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:45,028
- Sir. Please, hear me out. I... 
 - You what? What?

462
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,937
I really didn't know.

463
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,369
I can't cut Kang Baek out of my life because he's my son,

464
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:50,869
but Na Geun Woo married my ex-wife 20 years ago,

465
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,978
and whenever we met, we were hostile to each other.

466
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:57,309
So how would I have known if he cheated on my ex or killed a girl?

467
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,579
Then how do you know Kang Baek didn't do it?

468
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:03,119
Of course, Kang Baek couldn't have done it.

469
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,589
Kang Baek... He's Kang Baek.

470
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,288
- He would never... 
 - You wouldn't have known.

471
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:09,929
You divorced her 20 years ago,

472
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,728
so you rarely get to see him once a month.

473
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,099
He's a grown man now. How could you have known

474
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,819
what went through his head?

475
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:20,939
Please, sir. Please help us just this once.

476
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,008
I won't even bring up the marriage between Kang Baek and Ji Yi.

477
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,308
- Please just... 
 - Just what?

478
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:28,379
Tell me.

479
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,279
Just give me a bit more time.

480
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,949
If this gets out to the press, this will be the end of us.

481
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:34,249
"Us?"

482
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,799
Who is this "us"?

483
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:45,758
Why are you clumping me up with you and your family?

484
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,703
It's a sinking ship.

485
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:50,298
You wanted to bury the investigation of Jusung,

486
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:52,068
and you can enter politics now.

487
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,198
Now, your future can be guaranteed.

488
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:58,222
This is good news for you.

489
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:00,292
I know that.

490
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,079
The investigation of Jusung.

491
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,195
To cover that up,

492
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:10,248
you want me to sink into the mire?

493
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:13,789
You don't have to do a thing. Nothing at all.

494
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,289
I'll take care of it! Hye Ryul and I will make it work.

495
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:18,792
That crazy witch, Hye Ryul.

496
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,798
You can't control her.

497
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,574
Yes, I can.

498
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:26,913
Things have changed now. I can do that now.

499
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,943
You just have to give me your approval.

500
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,109
Just approve a document.

501
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,953
That's all I need.

502
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,019
Don't worry about Kang Baek. I'll keep a close eye on him.

503
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:46,979
Mom, please take care of him.

504
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:54,399
I don't know how you got him to agree to this,

505
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,799
but you got your husband to take the fall for murder.

506
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,968
His fatherly love is so touching.

507
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,825
Sorry,

508
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,169
but I was on my way out. Move.

509
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,738
Do you think you're the only one with a brain?

510
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:07,039
Do you think you're the only calculative one?

511
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,549
You couldn't stop him from turning himself in,

512
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,379
and since you ran out of hands to play,

513
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:13,178
you deflected people's attention by making him the suspect,

514
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,979
and you'll be busy behind the curtains.

515
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:17,131
It's obvious!

516
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:24,525
I'm fine with you taking over the family.

517
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,928
I grew up here

518
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:29,813
but I didn't want to stay with a cold-hearted family.

519
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,404
Besides, it suits you much better,

520
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,569
but there's a limit to how much

521
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,809
I can put up with your attacks just because I'm your family.

522
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,778
To save Na Geun Woo...

523
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:43,309
No. Technically, you're deflecting the public's attention

524
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:44,848
from Na Geun Woo to Jusung to save Kang Baek.

525
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:48,428
So you're really going to get an arrest warrant for my husband?

526
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:55,929
You told her to do that!

527
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,188
Moo Ryul.

528
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,828
I don't even want to bring up

529
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:03,028
how you favorited her and how disappointing it was,

530
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:07,297
but you shouldn't at least push your daughter off the cliff!

531
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,609
Moo Ryul, It's not what you think.

532
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,738
If we can just get past this for Kang Baek's sake...

533
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:15,609
- If we can do that— 
 - Is he your only grandson?

534
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:17,008
Then what about my children?

535
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:19,919
Why do you have to arrest the father of my children for Kang Baek?

536
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:22,739
Why? Why should I let you do that?

537
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:27,758
Do you think I can even breathe in that house?

538
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,629
Did you even think about it?

539
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,488
Did you even think how it must have been for me?

540
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:34,372
Please.

541
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:41,009
I'm done acting as your insurance policy now.

542
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,802
Moo Ryul.

543
00:36:01,802 --> 00:36:04,126
What's this?

544
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:06,260
Where did you get this?

545
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,658
You'd better not do what you're about to do.

546
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:12,702
Or I'll have to come up with more scandalous news!

547
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:14,987
Was it you?

548
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,408
Did you send these pictures to me?

549
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,538
What do you mean?

550
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:23,547
You sent the same pictures to me.

551
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,352
You should have done this from the get-go.

552
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,978
It looks like this was bound to happen all along.

553
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,549
What are you talking about? I never sent you any pictures.

554
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:34,556
Why would I send you these pictures?

555
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,288
Since the whole country would end up seeing the pictures,

556
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:41,598
I guess it wouldn't have hurt to send them to me first.

557
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,968
Kang Baek! That's enough!

558
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,924
I won't do it.

559
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,310
What?

560
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,091
I won't do what you're worried about.

561
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:57,108
I don't have time to waste here, so get out of my way.

562
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:58,829
Are you sure?

563
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:01,218
How? What else can you do?

564
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,079
Move!

565
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,389
I'm on my way to fix this, so all of us can get out of this.

566
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,982
Honey.

567
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:35,909
Why didn't you sleep some more?

568
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:39,468
How could I? After what happened last night.

569
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:42,844
You were turning and tossing all night.

570
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:50,368
There really is no news article about Professor Na.

571
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,788
You're really amazing.

572
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:55,339
You just made a few late-night phone calls.

573
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,635
It's a temporary fix.

574
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:02,779
If I don't fix it properly, it will leak soon.

575
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:07,516
By the way, what is Hye Ryul planning to do?

576
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:16,658
Goodness. You never discuss important matters with me.

577
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:20,275
At times, the less you know, the better it is.

578
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:25,167
Right. That's true.

579
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,517
Butler Yang.

580
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:50,366
Yes, ma'am.

581
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:54,500
- And the news articles? 
 - None, ma'am.

582
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,423
I searched online as well. There's none.

583
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:02,249
It seems it's all right so far.

584
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:04,075
Okay.

585
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:10,513
I would like to pray with you today.

586
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:16,064
- Really? 
 - Yes.

587
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,590
For Kang Baek.

588
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:32,341
Thank you.

589
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:38,431
It's been a long time since I prayed.

590
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:42,482
He may answer my prayer.

591
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,085
Has it been 40 years?

592
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:50,876
It's already been that long.

593
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,960
I wondered if He had abandoned me.

594
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:02,823
In the end, I resented Him a lot.

595
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:05,110
That can't be true.

596
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:09,343
He wouldn't abandon His children.

597
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,074
Besides,

598
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:16,729
I've always been praying

599
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:19,521
for you

600
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:21,484
and...

601
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:25,397
your late son as well.

602
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,395
Yes.

603
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,954
I know.

604
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:40,191
That's why I was always grateful.

605
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,388
Father.

606
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,150
Please protect Kang Baek.

607
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:04,649
Please listen to my prayer and show Kang Baek a path to take.

608
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:07,596
Please save Kang Baek,

609
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,099
Ms. Han, and Ms. Ham.

610
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,348
If you answer my prayer,

611
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,168
I will

612
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:23,925
believe with all of my heart

613
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,801
that you're generous and benevolent.

614
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,385
Lord.

615
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:38,587
No. I'm on my way to work.

616
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:42,164
You're a lawyer, so you can go see him.

617
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:43,829
Take me with you.

618
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:47,133
That's only the case if I represent your father,

619
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:50,969
but your father said he didn't want a lawyer.

620
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,569
Then what do we do?

621
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:54,738
Someone should go there and help him.

622
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:59,008
My dad... Are we going to leave him alone in there?

623
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:00,419
As if we're abandoning him?

624
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:03,550
Enough! Like I said, there's nothing I can do!

625
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,519
Grandpa!

626
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:11,667
Grandpa!

627
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:27,175
All right. Let's do it.

628
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,379
I wish we could've done this sooner.

629
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:35,519
That family sure likes to complicate things.

630
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,849
So the real culprit that crazy Dolphin knows...

631
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,353
Why did he kill Hong Nan Hee?

632
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:47,813
He just hit her on the spur of the moment.

633
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:50,568
Maybe he's a junkie and was caught using drugs.

634
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,928
Oh, I see. So that's it.

635
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,838
A junkie's spur-of-the-moment murder while high on drugs.

636
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,108
That's how you'll wrap it up?

637
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,178
Oh my, people will be so bored now with nothing to chew out.

638
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:06,249
They'll no longer see Jusung on the news.

639
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,084
Right, Mr. Ko?

640
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:13,408
Yes, I'll make sure it won't happen.

641
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:16,858
Don't forget that you're making this promise with your life on the line.

642
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:19,329
From now on, let's get along.

643
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:22,085
Okay, Ko Won Kyung?

644
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:25,199
- Yes, sir. 
 - Come on. Think of me as a brother.

645
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,000
Call me by my first name like before. Drop the honorifics.

646
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,838
That day, I said that out of anger,

647
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,238
but hearing you talking so politely makes me uncomfortable.

648
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,778
Let's just go back to the old-time way.

649
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:43,023
- Yes, sir. 
 - Hey, come on.

650
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:47,706
- Okay, Jang Il.
 - Good.

651
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:51,698
So this is all you need?

652
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,482
Open it.

653
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,949
   

654
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,689
   

655
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:21,680
It'll be taken care of today as you promised, right?

656
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,528
Goodness. Don't you worry.

657
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,729
Just one phone call and they'll head over to the police station.

658
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,629
Oh, it's lunchtime already.

659
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,169
What should we order?

660
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,138
Ms. Jung! Call Golden Castle!

661
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:40,738
Hey, why the long face? Smile a little, will you?

662
00:44:40,738 --> 00:44:43,548
You're a prosecutor, yet you can't keep a poker face?

663
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:47,545
You have a big face, so it shows easily.

664
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:50,988
Once he's behind bars, he won't get out until the day he dies anyway.

665
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,818
He's a total scumbag.

666
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:57,928
He sold drugs to kids.

667
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,559
Thanks to this, he'll go to jail for murder.

668
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:03,628
It'll make things a little easier for his family,

669
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:06,229
and our society will become a bit cleaner.

670
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:08,892
It's a win-win for everyone.

671
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:13,809
Other people think that we caught the real culprit.

672
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:16,213
Yes, I know that.

673
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,614
Hold on, but...

674
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,818
Did Han Hye Ryul buy that?

675
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:26,479
She has nothing to do with this.

676
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,658
What are you talking about? Do you think I'm an idiot?

677
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:33,028
You don't have a single card to present to Chief Jang.

678
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:36,599
Of course, Han Hye Ryul will take the lead and try to strike a deal.

679
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,838
All right. That's not important now.

680
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,709
We should move quickly so that Professor Na can have dinner at home later today,

681
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,108
and that way, you can be released soon too.

682
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:51,249
Okay, let's drop this. I'm tired.

683
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:59,019
You know, since I'm already here, I want to stay for dinner.

684
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:01,223
Is that okay, Mr. Ko?

685
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:05,302
Sure, suit yourself.

686
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:09,358
What shall I do until my food arrives?

687
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:11,478
Do you know how to play Go?

688
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,174
After that,

689
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:20,538
I saw the iron pipe lying around, so I grabbed it without thinking...

690
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:23,518
I swear, I didn't know she'd die like that.

691
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,805
Then I threw the body

692
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,884
into the lake.

693
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,430
You know, like those scenes you see in dramas...

694
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,465
Okay, then...

695
00:46:35,465 --> 00:46:38,550
Where is the murder weapon? The iron pipe.

696
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:45,447
You keep insisting that you're the culprit,

697
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:47,599
so you must know.

698
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,686
Oh, that's...

699
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,132
Well, what did I do with it?

700
00:46:55,338 --> 00:46:58,631
Right. I threw it in the lake too.

701
00:47:03,378 --> 00:47:04,691
Here.

702
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:24,179
Excuse us for a moment.

703
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:31,871
Hey, isn't it that bag?

704
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,758
Yes, the purse she was wearing.

705
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:42,693
It wasn't found at the scene.

706
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,139
   

707
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:04,826
Shoot.

708
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:12,208
   

709
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,718
 Hey, Yoon Eun Mi! What is your problem? 

710
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:18,988
Have you lost your mind?

711
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:22,081
You're there, yet you didn't report this to me?

712
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:24,429
Nothing is for certain yet.

713
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:27,398
The investigators haven't confirmed it yet.

714
00:48:27,398 --> 00:48:29,669
Besides, it's just so strange.

715
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:32,008
He was never even considered a suspect.

716
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:35,539
He has no ties to her. How am I supposed to believe he killed her?

717
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,568
On top of that, he turned himself in?  Isn't something fishy here?

718
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:42,218
We should speak with the investigators in charge and—

719
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:46,048
And we'll lose the scoop while you do that?

720
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,788
 It hasn't been made official yet, but the Chief Superintendent has already admitted it. 

721
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:53,798
A press briefing has been scheduled. Everyone's on their way there now.

722
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:56,729
Isn't that enough to make it a fact, which you love?

723
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,798
 He's a drug addict. 

724
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:01,738
 Have you never seen an insane man beat up a woman to death? 

725
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:06,309
Everyone in the country was looking for the killer, so I bet he got scared and turned himself in.

726
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:08,108
Just say, "The real culprit has turned himself in."

727
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:10,139
"She died after an altercation with a drug addict."

728
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:12,879
Just do that in front of the police station.

729
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:16,519
-   That picture is all we need.  
 - Even so...

730
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:20,775
Say, "Whether or not sexual assault was his goal is unknown."

731
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,428
I can't do that, sir.

732
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:28,858
- I'm sorry. 
 -  What? Hey! 

733
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,043
Hey, I'm sorry.

734
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:33,117
I can't do this.

735
00:49:33,128 --> 00:49:35,139
You guys should head back to the office first.

736
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,419
I need to speak with the detectives in charge of the case.

737
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:41,692
- Okay, it's fine. 
 - Sorry.

738
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:52,789
 This just came in. 

739
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:57,289
 The investigation on the law school student murder has taken a new turn. 

740
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:01,499
 Earlier today, the real culprit turned himself in. 

741
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,329
 Park, the accused, was drunk at the time. 

742
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,568
 He ran into Hong, the victim, while roaming the campus. 

743
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:10,938
 He insists that they got into an argument because she made condescending remarks without an apology. 

744
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:16,008
 He confessed that he killed Hong and threw the body into the lake 

745
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:17,649
 in order to destroy evidence. 

746
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:20,878
 Park is a former drug convict with multiple priors. 

747
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:24,379
 He seemed to be under the influence of drugs even when he turned himself in. 

748
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:29,119
Park's statement and the evidence submitted by him

749
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,028
give us enough reason to believe that he is telling the truth.

750
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:38,549
So at the moment, we believe that Park is the real culprit.

751
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:44,469
We, the police, sincerely apologize for causing you concern.

752
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:47,669
- Are you taking questions? 
 - Can we get a comment?

753
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:53,108
Was this it? This was it, after all?

754
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:55,449
You said we'd all be able to breathe at last.

755
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:58,548
Are we using another innocent person?

756
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:01,152
What are you talking about?

757
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:03,218
It's not what you think, Kang Baek!

758
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:05,688
That man killed Hong Nan Hee.

759
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,129
We received a tip-off.

760
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:09,999
Liar. You're lying!

761
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:14,323
Mom, you know it's not true. You don't believe it either!

762
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,669
Kang Baek.

763
00:51:16,669 --> 00:51:18,676
Let's stop now.

764
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:22,079
Doing all these horrible things... Let's stop, please!

765
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,535
Let's please stop, Mom!

766
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,449
Please.

767
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,933
Please...

768
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,669
Please stop, Mom.

769
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:34,296
Kang Baek.

770
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,388
Kang Baek.

771
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,329
Kang Baek.

772
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:43,309
Mom, please stop...

773
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:47,177
Mom, stop...

774
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,439
Stop...

775
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,053
It's okay.

776
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,407
 Because I... 

777
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:09,367
 I'm gay. 

778
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:13,729
 Doing all these horrible things... Let's stop, please. 

779
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:16,198
 Please stop, Mom! 

780
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:17,883
 Stop... 

781
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:55,989
   

782
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:11,082
   

783
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:01,158
Where did he go?

784
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,722
Kang Baek.

785
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:14,420
Kang Baek.

786
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,119
Kang Baek!

787
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:24,766
Hye Ryul! What's wrong?

788
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:27,917
Kang Baek... He's on the rooftop.

789
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:53,888
Grandpa!

790
00:54:53,888 --> 00:54:55,318
Stay in your room.

791
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:56,758
- Butler Yang. 
 - Yes.

792
00:54:56,758 --> 00:54:58,358
Come with me.

793
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,552
Kang Baek.

794
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,417
Kang Baek!

795
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:21,079
Kang Baek.

796
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:23,118
It's my fault.

797
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,289
It's all my fault.

798
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:30,313
Please come down from there.

799
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:33,193
What did you do?

800
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:46,646
I'm better off dead as a murderer.

801
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:48,258
Then...

802
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:51,637
everyone will be at ease.

803
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:55,779
Great-grandpa said

804
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:59,802
a murderer is better than a homosexual.

805
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:04,389
What are you talking about?

806
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:07,752
Please come down from there!

807
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,014
If you know your sin, repent!

808
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:15,298
- Father. 
 - Grandpa.

809
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:16,898
And...

810
00:56:16,898 --> 00:56:19,038
no suicide!

811
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:24,209
A sinner who commits suicide can't go to paradise.

812
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:28,741
Father, please stop!

813
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:35,188
Don't mind what Grandpa said.

814
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:37,233
I'm sorry.

815
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:39,817
It's all my fault.

816
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:42,941
Please come down from there.

817
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:50,299
Did he really do it?

818
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,510
What?

819
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,140
The man who killed Nan Hee.

820
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,428
The man who turned himself in for Dad. Did he do it?

821
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:05,588
There's evidence, and...

822
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,980
I'll end up in purgatory

823
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,242
for being a coward.

824
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:14,978
I remained silent even though I knew.

825
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,641
Mom.

826
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:21,952
Yes.

827
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:28,406
I know

828
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,713
that you...

829
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,922
Kang Baek!

830
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,532
Kang Baek!

831
00:57:52,532 --> 00:57:54,140
Kang Baek.

832
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,511
Kang Baek.

833
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:02,992
Kang Baek.

834
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,742
Answer me.

835
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:08,693
Kang Baek.

836
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,154
Kang Baek?

837
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:15,018
Answer me, Kang Baek.

838
00:58:15,018 --> 00:58:16,839
Kang Baek.

839
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:28,510
♫  When it rains on  ♫

840
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:34,270
♫  On the dark blue beach  ♫

841
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:41,590
♫  Where is the sky?  ♫

842
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:47,690
♫  And where is the water?  ♫

843
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:55,050
♫  When I'm submerged silently  ♫

844
00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:00,990
♫  in that deep sea  ♫

845
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:08,130
♫  What is alive  ♫

846
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:14,320
♫  and what is dead?  ♫

847
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:20,800
♫  A friend's voice  ♫

848
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:27,330
♫  from afar  ♫

849
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,160
♫  Will the running  ♫

850
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,450
♫  train wheels  ♫

851
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,770
♫  answer?  ♫

852
00:59:59,488 --> 01:00:04,798
 You became furious, you grabbed the iron pipe nearby, 

853
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,898
 and hit the right side of Hong Nan Hee's head from the back. 

854
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:10,769
 Are you right-handed? 

855
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:13,136
 What? Yes. 

856
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:16,178
 Then you threw the body into the lake to get rid of the proof 

857
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:18,448
 and the iron pipe as well. 

858
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,048
 Say you saw it in the drama 

859
01:00:21,048 --> 01:00:22,649
 or something like that. 

860
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:24,149
 Okay. 

861
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:27,959
 If you change your mind, 

862
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:31,014
 you know what'll happen. 

863
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:34,358
 Dolphin 

864
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:36,566
 is a scary man. 

865
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:40,129
 That will never happen. Ever. 

866
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,908
 Is my wife getting the money today? 

867
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:47,500
 Yes, all in cold hard cash. 

868
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:53,952
 What if the detectives don't buy it? 

869
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:13,263
 That's why you need this. 

870
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:24,300



871
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:28,196
   
 ♫   Show me your face   ♫ 

872
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:38,460
♫  Why are you trying to hide it?  ♫

873
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:45,250
♫  Sing out of your voice as sharp as an owl  ♫

874
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:52,240
♫   Try taking off your persona   ♫

875
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:59,240
♫  Get out into the world  ♫

876
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,840
♫  Why do you want to hide?  ♫

877
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,758
♫  Tell me why  ♫

878
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:13,728
 Would a kind-hearted boy like Kang Baek really end up in purgatory? 

879
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:17,528
 How dare you say his name with your filthy mouth? 

880
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:19,068
 Send me a car tomorrow night. 

881
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,469
 We don't have much time left. 

882
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,638
 Nan Hee said it was a shield that would protect you even in purgatory. 

883
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:26,508
 My son died because of you! 

884
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:28,879
 Stop it! You killed her. 

885
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,879
 I don't think your father is the culprit. 

886
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:35,119
 My dad killed her! I have nothing more to tell you! 

887
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,119
 There is someone who knows what really happened that night. 

888
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,258
 You can just keep your mouth shut. 

889
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,858
 I'm here to report. 

890
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:46,283
 The real culprit is someone else.
