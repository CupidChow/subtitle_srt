1
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,562
Kang Baek!

2
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,487
Kang Baek!

3
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:26,491
Kang Baek, no...

4
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,432
Kang Baek!

5
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,538
Kang Baek!

6
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:33,505
Kang Baek!

7
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,672
No!

8
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:41,571
 Last night, Han, the eldest son of Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul   

9
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,472
 and Professor Na Geun Woo, passed away. 

10
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,571
 He was on the rooftop of his house 

11
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,442
 when he tripped due to the sudden blackout. 

12
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,782
 He fell and ended up passing away. 

13
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,752
 His funeral took place in private, 

14
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:56,716
 and the bereaved asked not to make speculative reports about his death. 

15
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,150
   

16
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:26,000



17
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,631
Get some sleep, Hye Ryul.

18
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:46,622
You couldn't sleep throughout the funeral.

19
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,601
Okay.

20
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,764
Mom.

21
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,939
Yes?

22
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:18,822
I wonder what Kang Baek tried to say.

23
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:27,480
After "Mom", he said something,

24
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,362
but I couldn't hear.

25
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,095
It was inaudible.

26
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,059
Did you?

27
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,170
Hye Ryul.

28
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,391
Stop thinking about it for now.

29
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,368
We'll talk later when you wake up.

30
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,421
Okay?

31
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,972
Okay.

32
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,250
♫  When it rains on  ♫

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,573
 I'm off to catch you, Kang Baek! 

34
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:26,460
 Is it you there? I'm on my way. 

35
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,270
♫  Where is the sky?  ♫

36
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,292
 I'm going to catch you now! 

37
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,771
 I got you! 

38
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:37,224
 I caught you! 

39
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:40,535
 My son. 

40
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:45,026
 Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. 

41
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,200
 Off I go. 

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
♫  In that deep sea  ♫

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,970
 Where are you, Kang Baek? 

44
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,170
♫  What is alive  ♫

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,680
 I wonder where my sweetheart is... 

46
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,710
♫  And what is dead?  ♫

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,380
♫  A friend's appearance  ♫

48
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,930
 Kang Baek.

♫   In front of you  ♫

50
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,510
 Found you! 

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:32,300
♫  Glitter on the flying petals. Glitter on the flying petals  ♫

52
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,170
♫  A friend's voice  ♫

53
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,770
 Mom.

♫  From afar  ♫

55
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,181
 Yes. 

56
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,466
 I know 

57
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:50,250
 that you... 

58
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,020
♫  Will the running train wheels  ♫

59
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,470
 What? 

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,100
♫  Answer?  ♫

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,998
 Say it again. 

62
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:02,220
 That you... 

63
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,736
What are you doing here?

64
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,160
It's you, Gwang Jeon.

65
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:37,322
I couldn't sleep at the thought of Kang Baek.

66
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,955
I'll leave you alone.

67
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:46,129
I bet you want to pray quietly alone.

68
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:55,172
Look.

69
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:00,001
You know what the Bible says just as much as your father.

70
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:05,146
Would a kind-hearted boy like Kang Baek really end up in purgatory?

71
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,261
What did you say?

72
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:14,261
Your father keeps saying that he will go to purgatory,

73
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:17,100
but Kang Baek... Kang Baek...

74
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,780
Know your place, Kim Yang Sun!

75
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,378
What?

76
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,515
What did you just say?

77
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:30,250
I said, know your place.

78
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,282
What?

79
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:34,062
I figured out who you were a long time ago.

80
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:38,966
You were well-behaved in my father's embrace,

81
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,442
so I just considered you an expensive toy.

82
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:46,420
What... What are you talking about?

83
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:08,775
How dare you say his name with your filthy mouth?

84
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,290
That's not what I meant...

85
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,210
Know your place and behave.

86
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:25,132
That greedy old geezer will never register your marriage,

87
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:29,695
but at least, you won't be starved as long as you're alive.

88
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:35,781
For an ex-convict who lived in prison for 20 years,

89
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,973
it's not so bad.

90
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,441
Oh, goodness.

91
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:26,361
We brought food to everyone as Butler Yang asked,

92
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:29,061
but they barely touched it.

93
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:30,231
What a waste!

94
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,371
We're now in the nightmare of dishwashing plus delivery!

95
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,471
We have no choice for the time being.

96
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:40,532
Everyone must be devastated after what happened to Kang Baek.

97
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:44,848
Is it not an accident,

98
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,897
but suicide?

99
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,622
I mean, the fence is this high.

100
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,052
I get that it was raining and the lights went out,

101
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:55,016
but how did he fall outside the fence?

102
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:57,621
Tell me about it. I thought it was strange too.

103
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,461
- Right? 
 - Look at you.

104
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,701
Are you this clueless after working here for so long?

105
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,201
Suicide can never happen in this family.

106
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:07,501
How talkative!

107
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:13,211
Did you forget you signed a confidential agreement

108
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,542
when you started working here? Is that why you're gossiping?

109
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:19,382
It's a trend to use non-Korean housekeepers these days.

110
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:22,621
Do you think you can get paid this much if you work somewhere else?

111
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,552
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'll be careful.

112
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,875
I'll be more careful.

113
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,122
Didn't Ms. Ham eat anything, either?

114
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,931
No, she wasn't in her room.

115
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,662
She seems to be in the prayer room,

116
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:38,841
but we're not allowed to go in there.

117
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:44,355
Should I make some yam juice?

118
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:47,005
Sure.

119
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,826
Ma'am!

120
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,334
What happened to your hand?

121
00:10:58,334 --> 00:10:59,921
What happened to you, ma'am?

122
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:02,182
I ended up telling her.

123
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,901
She just didn't know her place.

124
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,885
She dared to mention our Kang Baek's name,

125
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,098
so I told her.

126
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:17,430
It wasn't fun at all.

127
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,468
Uneducated,

128
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:25,050
she was just a pretty ex-convict.

129
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,361
Every time she acted refined so desperately,

130
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,056
I imagined

131
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:35,656
how satisfying it would be

132
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:40,546
to tell her that I knew all about who she was,

133
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:46,106
but it wasn't as expected.

134
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,642
You didn't do that for fun.

135
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,342
Your father got too soft because of her.

136
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:55,666
He even had you manage his assets in the borrowed-name accounts.

137
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:02,016
The documents I manage are meaningless without the ledger.

138
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,250
They're just pieces of paper.

139
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,605
The ledger?

140
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:09,984
You mean, the book that he's keeping safely

141
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,536
in the safe?

142
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:15,601
If a fire breaks out in this house, it will be the first thing he takes.

143
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,872
The secrets in that small notebook

144
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,928
do not allow anyone to handle the assets as they want.

145
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,768
But...

146
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:31,261
I don't care anymore.

147
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:35,702
The ledger and the assets in the borrowed-name accounts.

148
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,418
I'm sick and tired of all those.

149
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:45,191
I just want the old geezer to die soon,

150
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:49,103
or I might become wanting to kill him.

151
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,292
Kang Baek had to hear it before he died,

152
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,491
that being a murderer was better.

153
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:04,422
He had to hear such a thing before he died.

154
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:09,425
I cannot forgive him.

155
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:59,109
Ms. Park Ji Seon?

156
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,672
I'm Reporter Yoon Eun Mi from SBC.

157
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,772
I'd like to interview you regarding your father.

158
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:05,931
You got the wrong person.

159
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:11,142
I don't think your father is the culprit.

160
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,922
- I think the real culprit is— 
 - I said, you got the wrong person!

161
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,562
Hello.

162
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,612
Let's go eat.

163
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:51,691
Goodness.

164
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,321
He has gotten so haggard after losing his son.

165
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:55,622
He is resigning too.

166
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:57,892
Then again, how can he keep working here after what happened?

167
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,791
And someone else turned out to be the culprit.

168
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,402
- You suspected him too. 
 - When did I?

169
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,462
- You did! 
 - Come on.

170
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:07,132
Whatever. Let's just go eat.

171
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,642
- You said that the other day. 
 - I didn't.

172
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,571
 Chairman Ji Joon Ki, the heavyweight of Christmas Fund 

173
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:16,342
 known as Dolphin, was granted a stay of execution 

174
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:19,351
 and released temporarily on the last 11th. 

175
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,252
 His attorney revealed that he suffered 

176
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,451
 from a back injury during labor 

177
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:27,792
 which caused CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome. 

178
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,091
 And that he had to be hospitalized due to his worsened condition 

179
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,232
 with extreme breakthrough pain, 

180
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,502
 burning sensations, and facial paralysis. 

181
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,731
 A CRPS patient is very sensitive even to small pain. 

182
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,602
What are you doing, drinking in broad daylight?

183
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,729
Don't you care about others?

184
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,912
Senior Secretary Ahn called, so get ready.

185
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,981
He wants to meet up and discuss the election.

186
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,206
I'm not interested.

187
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,733
Go without me.

188
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:02,261
I get that your son is dead,

189
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,981
but there's no need to go back on what's almost done for you.

190
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,302
What are you doing, you punk?

191
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,160
I don't need

192
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:19,836
what's almost done.

193
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,556
Get out,

194
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,242
before I ruin what's almost done for you too.

195
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,128
You'll regret this.

196
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,751
Darn.

197
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,260
Hey.

198
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,940
Senior.

199
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,591
How did the warrant request go?

200
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,661
It will be issued this afternoon.

201
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:15,082
I see. Good. You may leave.

202
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,032
- Senior. 
 - What?

203
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,444
I'm here with my business.

204
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,682
Oh, really?

205
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,811
Sorry. I'm a little out of my mind these days.

206
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,527
What is it?

207
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,595
Well,

208
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,832
a friend of mine is the prosecutor in charge of Hong Nan Hee's case.

209
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:42,492
He is planning to demand life imprisonment.

210
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:46,062
I wondered if hearing this might make you feel a bit better.

211
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,750
You seem too devastated lately.

212
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,651
Prosecutor Oh.

213
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:58,572
Maybe I adored you too much, seeing how you're acting up.

214
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,611
- Pardon? 
 - This is my privacy.

215
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,042
It's not your business to meddle with.

216
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,311
Keep private and public matters separate.

217
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:07,982
If you weren't going to let me meddle with this much, you shouldn't have adored me.

218
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:09,022
Get out.

219
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,792
Acting as if nothing happened won't change anything.

220
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:16,161
You also need time to mourn!

221
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,477
I said, "Get out."

222
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,988
   

223
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:15,212
It feels especially good today.

224
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:20,525
Lately, it must be very tough for you.

225
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,762
I'm sad that this is the only thing I can do for you.

226
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:28,062
Is Gwang Jeon still resenting me?

227
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:29,646
What?

228
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:36,872
Well, we live in the same house. She can't avoid me forever.

229
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:40,641
She doesn't care for family meals anymore.

230
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:45,382
She must be having a hard time because she used to love her grandson so dearly.

231
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:47,111
She probably needs someone to resent.

232
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,552
Is it my fault that he killed himself?

233
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:54,535
He was weak to the bone from the start.

234
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,456
Kang Baek was a good kid.

235
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,392
Don't say such harsh things about him.

236
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:02,475
He said he liked men,

237
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,553
and he killed himself too,

238
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:08,601
so he will never be saved.

239
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,292
Come in!

240
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,421
You have a visitor, sir.

241
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,721
It's Attorney Nam Soo Hyuk.

242
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,733
Is that so? I'll be down soon.

243
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:17,236
Send me a car tomorrow night.

244
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,941
We don't have much time left.

245
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,501
Ham Gwang Jeon knew everything all along.

246
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,611
I didn't get caught.

247
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:26,191
She had known about me the whole time.

248
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,371
She won't even try to feign ignorance anymore.

249
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,057
Yes.

250
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,620
We either do this now or never.

251
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,706
Okay. Tomorrow night.

252
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:43,102
So you want me to get rid of the video for good?

253
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,532
Yes.

254
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:48,232
The video cannot leak in whatever circumstances.

255
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:51,142
Mr. Han has the original footage, and the dead girl, Hong Nan Hee...

256
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,771
I'm not sure what she did with the video.

257
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,341
Then you don't have to be so scared.

258
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,574
Given what you told me,

259
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:02,552
I doubt Gun Do will leak the video.

260
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:06,221
No. The video should have never existed in the first place!

261
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,426
It's too dangerous,

262
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,026
but Han Gun Do doesn't get that.

263
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:16,062
He still hasn't told me where the video is or who has it now.

264
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,705
He has been quiet about it.

265
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,370
No one should've recorded it.

266
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,031
What did you say?

267
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,797
What makes you say that?

268
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:28,829
Where do you think he learned that trick?

269
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,351
Attorney Nam Soo Hyuk,

270
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:40,452
everyone is under the impression that you were recruited to the firm,

271
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,362
but actually, you used the corporate card

272
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,738
and corporate bank account for personal use.

273
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:48,666
That's why you left your previous firm.

274
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:54,071
You used the money to rent a studio and paid for living expenses

275
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,356
of your 19-year-old mistress.

276
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:03,636
Your then-wife, whom you divorced now, didn't know about your mistress.

277
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:10,226
Attorney Nam, I'll take care of the video.

278
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:13,529
I can silence the living.

279
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,428
What's so hard about silencing the dead?

280
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:20,833
You can just keep your mouth shut

281
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,502
like the dead.

282
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,328
Our exams are over!

283
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,721
See? He's doing that again.

284
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:50,461
- Come on. That's not nice. 
 - That's not it.

285
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:53,142
Didn't you know?

286
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,851
I heard there were a lot of those.

287
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,322
Hey, let's go.

288
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,752
   

289
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,292
   

290
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,892
   

291
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,421
   

292
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,862
   

293
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,662
   

294
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,132
   

295
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:03,401
   

296
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,881
   

297
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:14,625
 Go home. 

298
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,319
 Now! 

299
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:37,669
 Like Kang Baek said, 

300
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,666
 I need you to die for real. 

301
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,264
 But I'm too busy to let you kill me. 

302
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:47,439
 Can you kill me later? 

303
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:51,506
 I gave you plenty of chances. 

304
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,622
 A chance to give up. 

305
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:56,206
 A chance to stop. 

306
00:25:56,206 --> 00:26:00,306
 You turned my life into a battlefield. 

307
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:04,282
 I did my best not to get my son mixed up in this, 

308
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:07,813
 even if my heart was ripped into pieces! 

309
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:11,361
 I gave you a chance to get out of this without getting hurt, 

310
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,250
 but it's over. 

311
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:18,032
 Why must I let you do whatever you want? 

312
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:22,579
 Are you happy now? 

313
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:28,314
 Or do you still have more stuff left to do? 

314
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:32,962
 Kang Baek and I never dated. 

315
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:35,276
 We're just friends. 

316
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,689
 We never dated, and we will never date. 

317
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:42,531
 I only pretended to date him because he asked. 

318
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,362
 What? 

319
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:48,532
 He told me he might be able to avoid marrying Ji Yi that way. 

320
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:53,459
 He said without my help, the elders would never give up. 

321
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,651
 What... 

322
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,100
 What about the ring? 

323
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,790
 The ring? 

324
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,800
 What ring? 

325
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,995
 I see. 

326
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:15,231
 Kang Baek must have been serious about this charade. 

327
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:18,592
 I didn't know he prepared such props. 

328
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,092
 Is this funny to you? 

329
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:22,941
 Are you entertained? 

330
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,465
 Is ruining other people's lives fun for you? 

331
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:29,087
 You are... 

332
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,241
 You are a true monster. 

333
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:35,750
 I could never be a monster. 

334
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,290
 I don't have that much power. 

335
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:44,066
 Ms. Han, Hong Tae Hoon, the CEO of Hongyeon Engineering. 

336
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,670
 You don't recognize his name, do you? 

337
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:49,705
 I expected that. 

338
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:52,302
 You're only interested in cases like illegal successions of management 

339
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:55,832
 that cost tens of millions of dollars, or disturbances in the market, 

340
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:59,402
 but you're not at all interested in what Jusung did to its subcontractors 

341
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:01,641
 with Ham &amp; Lee's help. 

342
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:03,412
 To make sure the 100,000-dollar promissory note 

343
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:06,267
 went through to avoid going bankrupt, 

344
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,151
 he sold his late wife's wedding present out of desperation. 

345
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:13,292
 You neither know how it feels nor are interested in finding out. 

346
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,792
 What are you talking about? 

347
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:19,731
 What does this have to do with a subcontractor of Jusung? 

348
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,632
 You're messing with my son's life after sleeping with my husband. 

349
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,502
 What nonsense is this? 

350
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:28,245
 I never slept with your son. 

351
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,437
 Besides, 

352
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:36,801
 you should be more careful of people who want to use me, not me. 

353
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,941
 What did you say? 

354
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:42,194
 I didn't tell Kang Baek about the affair. 

355
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:45,936
 Someone sent those photos to Kang Baek. 

356
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,831
 The photos of me and Professor Na. 

357
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,282
 Even I don't know when those photos were taken. 

358
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:57,432
 Bye. 

359
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:20,519
- Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

360
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:29,261
   

361
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:30,362
   

362
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:31,532
   

363
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:32,902
   

364
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:34,302
   

365
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:35,872
   

366
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,001
   

367
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,142
   

368
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,471
   

369
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:40,612
   

370
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,711
   

371
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,882
   

372
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,282
   

373
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,681
   

374
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,217
   

375
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:06,546
   

376
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,208
Come in.

377
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,452
What's this about?

378
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,991
Well...

379
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,095
I came here to give you this.

380
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,247
 You want me to give this to Na Geun Woo? Why? 

381
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,881
 It's a shield. 

382
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:54,282
 A shield that can protect him even in purgatory. 

383
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:57,882
 Then why do you want to give this to him? 

384
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:00,049
 Because... 

385
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:02,592
 I dragged him to purgatory. 

386
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,744
What's this?

387
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,927
I don't know, either.

388
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,841
Nan Hee said it was a shield that would protect you even in purgatory,

389
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,301
but I don't know what's inside.

390
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,651
You didn't check what was inside?

391
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,945
Actually, I wanted to,

392
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:30,182
but the password consists of 2 5-letter words.

393
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,582
I can't even guess what it is.

394
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,892
I don't know any password either.

395
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:40,461
Think carefully. I'm sure you know it.

396
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,362
Maybe it has files about Nan Hee's father's case.

397
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:45,632
You know about her father, right? Hongyeon Engineering—

398
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,760
Don't you get it?

399
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,511
Nan Hee

400
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,472
wanted to ruin people so they'd be as miserable as her.

401
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:57,811
She was never herself around Kang Baek and me,

402
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:58,860
and maybe around you too.

403
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,690
No.

404
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,409
Nan Hee wasn't like that!

405
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,149
She...

406
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,796
felt sorry,

407
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:12,418
and she worried about you.

408
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:15,131
Not everything was a lie.

409
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,562
She was faking it at first, but she developed feelings for you,

410
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,631
so she was suffering too!

411
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:23,910
When I met her, she didn't seem so.

412
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:27,871
The initial intention was false, so the nature of it couldn't change.

413
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,911
So if her intention was sincere at first,

414
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,900
would the nature never change?

415
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,182
Then what about you and Ms. Han Hye Ryul?

416
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:38,761
You two were in love.

417
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,994
Are you still in love?

418
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:44,859
I want to forget all about it now.

419
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:49,232
Do whatever you want with it. You can throw it out or break it.

420
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:53,172
Giving you this was the last thing Nan Hee asked me to do,

421
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:56,537
so I must do what she asked me.

422
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,992
 When you pass the bar, let's drink it to celebrate then. 

423
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:19,360
 Really? 

424
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,890
 Of course. 

425
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:13,214
You didn't even touch it.

426
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,882
Did you have at least a few bites?

427
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,490
Why do you care?

428
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:22,492
- What? 
 - Why do you care?

429
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:26,882
Because...

430
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:29,751
you are still Kang Ye's mother.

431
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:34,552
That feels like a curse to me.

432
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:39,852
We're still in each other's lives because of Kang Ye.

433
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,440
I've had enough of this.

434
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,504
I have been

435
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,514
very patient with you.

436
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:49,396
What?

437
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:52,068
You've been patient?

438
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:54,766
You? You're being patient?

439
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:59,592
Kang Baek is dead because of you!

440
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,032
You killed him!

441
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:07,515
- My son died... because of you! 
 - Stop it!

442
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,707
You know that's not true.

443
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,271
You know it wasn't my fault!

444
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:13,711
Enough! Stop it!

445
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,541
Why not? Why wasn't it your fault?

446
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,789
Why not?

447
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:24,158
If you didn't cheat on me with Hong Nan Hee...

448
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,269
If I never married you...

449
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,848
Kang Baek is dead.

450
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:39,529
He died trying to protect you,

451
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,132
but do you still want to blame me for it?

452
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:44,275
What are you talking about?

453
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,153
Hong Nan Hee.

454
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:49,577
You killed her.

455
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:54,296
 Mom. 

456
00:35:58,421 --> 00:36:00,261
 I know 

457
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,847
 that you... 

458
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,408
 killed her. 

459
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:13,246
No.

460
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:18,179
No.

461
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,005
It wasn't me.

462
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:23,642
No.

463
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:27,762
I won't divorce you.

464
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:30,921
Don't get the wrong idea that I'm not divorcing you

465
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:33,137
because I still love you.

466
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,891
My son loved you so much and you're Kang Ye's mother,

467
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,775
so...

468
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:42,262
I don't want to testify that you're the culprit.

469
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:43,831
That's my reason.

470
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,616
No.

471
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,691
No.

472
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,295
No!

473
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,531
It wasn't me!

474
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:54,820
No.

475
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:58,581
I didn't kill Hong Nan Hee!

476
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:01,061
You didn't do it?

477
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:02,471
Then...

478
00:37:03,382 --> 00:37:06,291
are you saying Kang Baek lied?

479
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,243
I was just...

480
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:14,061
I just ran around the school to protect Kang Baek.

481
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,306
That's all I did!

482
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:19,381
So you still won't admit it.

483
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,651
That's why you even got a fall guy.

484
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,315
I guess you can't help it.

485
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,460
You're one of them, after all.

486
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:09,122
You're dressed in your workout clothes.

487
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:12,481
I feel uneasy with everything that's happened recently.

488
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:15,021
I thought an exercise might do me good.

489
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:16,592
Do you think I'm being insensitive?

490
00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:18,961
I booked a class. Should I cancel it?

491
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:22,798
There's no need for that. Go and exercise.

492
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:25,927
Will you come and watch me later?

493
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:28,432
I don't even play tennis now.

494
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:31,072
But still, you can check my posture.

495
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,742
I'm sure the instructor will teach you well.

496
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,141
That's why I'm asking you to come.

497
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:38,666
What? What do you mean?

498
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:42,321
Nothing. Don't mind me.

499
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,701
What's that about?

500
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:48,492
I might be mistaken.

501
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,291
The way the instructor looks at me is a bit off.

502
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,032
I think he's touching me a bit excessively during class.

503
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,262
What? You should have fired him, then!

504
00:38:57,262 --> 00:39:00,402
How can I? He came recommended by your junior.

505
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:03,771
Besides, I might be mistaken.

506
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:08,171
If I do that, I will end up as a laughingstock.

507
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:13,312
So will you come and watch me practice today? Please?

508
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:16,421
You're the only person I can ask.

509
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,514
Fine. I'll get ready and be out.

510
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:22,229
Is that a promise?

511
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,222
Make sure to wear the outfit I bought for you before.

512
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:26,891
It's a matching outfit with this.

513
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:29,336
Sure. I'll do that.

514
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:33,882
I love it. Thank you!

515
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,092
Have some tea.

516
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:38,949
Okay.

517
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,956
   

518
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,691
Come in.

519
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,831
   

520
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,748
This letter arrived this morning.

521
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,508
What...

522
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:12,109
Is there a problem, Mr. Nam?

523
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,491
Nothing. You can go.

524
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,372
   

525
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:35,092
- Hurry up. Wipe it well!
 - Hurry!

526
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,702
- Clean it thoroughly. 
 - Hurry!

527
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,731
- Move! 
 - Come on. Do a proper job!

528
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,572
- Guys! 
 - What is this?

529
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,573
Oh, look.

530
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,271
What? It's not there.

531
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:48,411
- Goodness. 
 - We did pretty well today.

532
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,311
Hey, you're cute.

533
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:56,621
 Attorney Nam, can't you please visit me? 

534
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,952
Hey, you're mine.

535
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:03,531
 There is someone who knows what really happened that night. 

536
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:07,372
 They'll inspect this letter, so I can't write the details here. 

537
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,666
 Please, hurry! 

538
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:24,175
- I was told not to let anybody in. 
 - Step aside.

539
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,761
   

540
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:42,740
I want to ask you something.

541
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,310
The man who turned himself in,

542
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:51,063
he really is the culprit, right?

543
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:57,415
He is the one who killed Hong Nan Hee, right?

544
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,521
Answer me. Hey!

545
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:43,912
   

546
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:52,646
Gosh.

547
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:57,771
Thank you.

548
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:01,340
No, I should thank you.

549
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,711
You know, my husband would never do such a thing.

550
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:11,220
I blame the drugs. He was such a gentle, kind man.

551
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,822
Even while raising our kids, he never once hit them.

552
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,889
Murder? My gosh.

553
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:24,202
Do you think my husband can be released?

554
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:28,472
- Well, the thing is... 
 - His health is deteriorating.

555
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:32,131
I hope he can be released before it gets cold.

556
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:36,717
Mom, I'm back!

557
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:40,002
I haven't seen those shoes before. Is someone here?

558
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,536
What are you doing here?

559
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:45,411
Hey.

560
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:49,952
This reporter is here to help your father clear his name.

561
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,262
- Please leave. 
 - Ji Seon!

562
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:55,061
You think Dad is innocent? Why?

563
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:57,406
Dad didn't come home that night.

564
00:43:57,406 --> 00:43:59,331
We have no idea what he did while high on drugs.

565
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:01,032
Why do you say he's innocent?

566
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:04,842
- Ji Seon, I told you that your dad quit drugs— 
 - Enough, okay?

567
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,242
You're the only one who doesn't see that he can never quit drugs.

568
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:11,842
Had you listened to me and reported him, he would've been in jail,

569
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:14,522
and she wouldn't have died that night.

570
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,322
Leave.

571
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,521
Get out!

572
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:24,291
- Wait. Please calm down. Why don't we talk... 
 - My dad killed her!

573
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:27,862
I have nothing more to tell you! Get out at once!

574
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:29,457
Get out! Now!

575
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:51,743
I guess I was wrong. He didn't come home that night.

576
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:55,452
His daughter also thinks that he did it.

577
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:56,521
 See? 

578
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:58,762
Forget about that case now,

579
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,145
and stop beating yourself up.

580
00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:05,762
Yes. All right. I'll call you.

581
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:08,322
- Was that Reporter Yoon? 
 - Yes.

582
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:11,243
She ended up visiting his family.

583
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,001
And? Did she find anything?

584
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:17,466
Supplementary evidence that he really is the culprit.

585
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,282
- Oh! 
 - Hey!

586
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:22,782
Joong Jin!

587
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:24,921
My gosh! Congratulations.

588
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,382
I heard you cleared a big case this time.

589
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:27,521
Hey, come on.

590
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:29,851
How did you do it? Let us in on your secret.

591
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,703
Come on. All drug cases are more or less the same.

592
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:37,862
I lucked out and caught one of the upper echelons.

593
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:39,981
After that, you know the drill.

594
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:44,407
They kept coming out like sweet potato vines.

595
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:46,472
 They're all dying to rat out their accomplices 

596
00:45:46,472 --> 00:45:50,372
 before the others do it so that they get their sentences reduced. 

597
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:57,020
You said you were at home that day.

598
00:45:58,452 --> 00:46:02,579
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

599
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:05,748
I forget what day it is when I'm on drugs.

600
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:09,262
So what happened?

601
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:12,886
The guy I did drugs with that night got in.

602
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:17,611
Gosh. Who knew I'd run into him here?

603
00:46:18,572 --> 00:46:24,155
If he rats me out to win points with the police, it's game over.

604
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:27,462
The security footage must show me entering the motel.

605
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:32,687
Then both you and I are really finished.

606
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:07,755
Goodness, I told you. Not today.

607
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:10,406
It's urgent.

608
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:13,841
I'm surprised you have something urgent to take care of.

609
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,461
Sir, why are you here?

610
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:25,629
I came for a cup of coffee.

611
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:28,351
You should have some coffee too.

612
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,572
Well, I'll leave you two to talk. I'll come back another time.

613
00:48:32,572 --> 00:48:34,472
You're already here, so talk now.

614
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:36,020
Why?

615
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,232
Is it something you can't talk about in front of me?

616
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:40,682
Gosh, I'm hurt.

617
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:43,698
Since when were you two so close?

618
00:48:43,698 --> 00:48:47,251
Oh, come on. Why are you so easily hurt?

619
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:50,021
You see, I trust you very much.

620
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:55,845
Now that you've aged, you're becoming too sensitive emotionally.

621
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:59,762
Hey, I was worried they'd suspend the execution of my punishment

622
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:01,231
for a lesser amount of time.

623
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,032
And he kindly came all the way here

624
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:07,472
to tell me in person that I have nothing to worry about.

625
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:11,041
Attorney Nam still doesn't know how to wrap things up cleanly.

626
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:14,161
He makes a mess and doesn't know how to clean it up.

627
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:23,163
Gosh.

628
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,897
Sir.

629
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:32,424
You see, Mr. Han Gun Do here...

630
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:34,339
Don't trust him too much.

631
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,271
If you do, he may stab you in the back. Big time.

632
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,615
- What? 
 - What are you talking about?

633
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:44,571
I have no reason to worry about him stabbing me in the back.

634
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:48,782
Well, remember our rendezvous at the hotel?

635
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:52,751
Except for the three of us, no one was supposed to know about it.

636
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:54,621
- Attorney Nam. 
 - Mr. Han Gun Do here

637
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,722
set up hidden cameras and recorded everything that went on in the room.

638
00:49:57,722 --> 00:49:58,723
Why are you being like this?

639
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:01,132
On top of that, that video has been hacked.

640
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:04,202
If that has been leaked, the stay of execution isn't even important.

641
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:07,242
All three of us are dead meat!

642
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:11,271
Mr. Han Gun Do still has the video in his possession,

643
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:13,831
even though he is aware of the situation.

644
00:50:13,831 --> 00:50:18,372
I hope you at least knew that when you decided to have coffee with him.

645
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:23,759
Hey.

646
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:25,594
Is this true?

647
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:33,047
You scumbag.

648
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:37,866
Chairman Ji, nothing will happen! We'll be fine!

649
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:42,702
You scum! Is it true?

650
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:45,941
I didn't know! Attorney Nam, stop him!

651
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:47,941
Attorney Nam—

652
00:50:48,641 --> 00:50:50,177
Answer me!

653
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:54,111
Look me straight in the eye and answer my question, you jerk!

654
00:50:58,282 --> 00:51:01,565
Gosh, so many cases.

655
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,501
   

656
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,921
What brings you here?

657
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,521
Today, I'm not here as a prosecutor,

658
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:38,390
but to report as a crime victim.

659
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:45,862
I was unaware this flash drive had a hacking tool when I received it,

660
00:51:45,862 --> 00:51:48,770
then I used it on this computer.

661
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,202
It highly likely hacked my computer.

662
00:51:52,202 --> 00:51:53,742
Then you should contact the cyber investigation—

663
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:56,386
I got that from Hong Nan Hee.

664
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:03,311
Hong Nan Hee hacked my computer.

665
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:08,052
We didn't find anything on Hong Nan Hee's computer.

666
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:11,291
Information Network Act or the criminal law does not punish

667
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,762
an attempted invasion of privacy. You're aware of that.

668
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:17,302
Are you saying you checked all the files on her computer?

669
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:20,262
Yes, we checked all the files that were there.

670
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,086
Let me guess.

671
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:25,771
The computer was formatted,

672
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,141
all clean,

673
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,181
and overwritten several times to prevent restoration.

674
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:32,782
How do you know?

675
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,581
Half of the computers from the seizure are made empty that way,

676
00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:42,794
and scraping the crumbs from them is what I do.

677
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:47,102
You'll need this flash drive to get the crumbs.

678
00:52:49,262 --> 00:52:51,169
Why are you here?

679
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,802
- What? 
 - What's so important

680
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,902
about making Hong Nan Hee a criminal now?

681
00:52:56,902 --> 00:52:59,671
She's already dead.

682
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:02,356
Before talking about the right to indict,

683
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:03,981
don't you have pity?

684
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:07,001
She had a lonely and painful death.

685
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:09,366
Gu Won.

686
00:53:11,182 --> 00:53:13,122
My son

687
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:18,171
also had a lonely and painful death.

688
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:24,125
Just because the person is dead, it doesn't wash away the sin,

689
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:29,472
but what Detective Ji meant was that you've gone too far.

690
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,092
Anyway,

691
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:35,342
she was young and pitiful. We can't prosecute her anyway.

692
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,990
I know what it's like to have a lonely and painful death,

693
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:42,342
so I'm going to find the culprit for her.

694
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:50,375
The real culprit is someone else.

695
00:53:51,092 --> 00:53:53,811
Let's find the culprit.

696
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:56,191
I knew that jerk wasn't reliable,

697
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,576
but how dare he backstab me like this?

698
00:54:03,171 --> 00:54:05,915
I'm disappointed in you too.

699
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:09,162
You kept your mouth closed when you knew all along?

700
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,512
Why are you here?

701
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:17,311
The man you got us has an issue.

702
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:18,151
What?

703
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,192
He lied about what he did that day.

704
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:26,001
The man who did drugs with him that day was arrested.

705
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:33,101
This is why you can never trust drug addicts.

706
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:35,102
I'll consult him first.

707
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:38,441
In the end, it's all about what the police find out.

708
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,971
Either get a different fall guy through the opposition party

709
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:44,382
and trade, or bribe them.

710
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:48,081
- Anyway, we shouldn't get that involved... 
 - No, no.

711
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:49,912
If they nitpick on the content of the consultation

712
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,921
and argue it was the destruction of evidence,

713
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,552
it'll only give us a headache.

714
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:56,660
But there is no other choice.

715
00:55:00,322 --> 00:55:02,585
Should I...

716
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,686
kill one?

717
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,244
What?

718
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,294
You know the prisoner's dilemma?

719
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:18,870
Two mouths had to keep shut,

720
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,882
but this all happened because they couldn't.

721
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:24,869
Then...

722
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:27,510
kill one of them.

723
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,644
Then the other...

724
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,937
will be quiet immediately.

725
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:38,810
- What are you... 
 - Boom!

726
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:44,871
Nothing to chicken out for.

727
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:47,398
I'm just kidding.

728
00:55:47,398 --> 00:55:50,752
I'm saying that's what I would do.

729
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:55,382
I'll tell him to keep his mouth closed.

730
00:55:55,382 --> 00:55:57,882
Make sure he never mentions my name.

731
00:55:57,882 --> 00:55:59,917
I'll tell him.

732
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,691
Hey.

733
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:07,507
"I'll tell him."

734
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,456
"I'll tell him?"

735
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:14,577
Is that "making sure" to you?

736
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:18,265
What else do you want me to...

737
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:25,515
Look.

738
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:31,975
You should suggest a deal he can't refuse.

739
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,961
Oh, honey. Are you not feeling well?

740
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:46,109
Because I haven't played it in a while.

741
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:48,132
You shouldn't have pushed yourself.

742
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:51,271
I couldn't stand watching him.

743
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:54,371
Your instructor was terrible.

744
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,682
No wonder your tennis skill didn't get any better.

745
00:56:57,682 --> 00:57:01,481
I'll get you a new instructor tomorrow.

746
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:03,052
That's for the best, right?

747
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,682
What's the point of being a former athlete?

748
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:07,441
His posture or accuracy isn't as good as yours.

749
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:10,152
I should've asked you earlier.

750
00:57:10,152 --> 00:57:11,536
Yes.

751
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:14,391
Because I haven't played for a while,

752
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:18,056
my whole body aches.

753
00:57:18,056 --> 00:57:20,885
I'm guaranteed to get a muscle ache tomorrow.

754
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:36,105
- Do you want one too? 
 - What is it?

755
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,021
Health supplement for muscle aches.

756
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,751
You'll feel better tomorrow if you take it before going to bed.

757
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,432
Give me one.

758
00:57:43,521 --> 00:57:44,990
Thanks.

759
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,516
My goodness!

760
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,202
Do you want some massage before going to bed?

761
00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:03,026
You're tired too.

762
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:06,541
Not tired enough to skip your massage.

763
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,386
Oh, that feels good.

764
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,052
 The person who killed Nan Hee... 

765
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:33,027
  - was Mom. 
 - It wasn't me! 

766
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:34,386
 I... 

767
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,841
 I didn't kill Hong Nan Hee! 

768
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:03,576
 A shield to protect me even in purgatory is... 

769
00:59:07,572 --> 00:59:10,492
   

770
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,850
   

771
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,628
 Remember. 

772
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:20,777
 I can become Aegis 

773
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:23,134
 and Hades. 

774
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,681
   

775
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:52,742
 Don't forget... 

776
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:55,349
 I could be your shield 

777
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:59,050
 or the devil that will drag you to purgatory. 

778
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:08,316
Hallelujah.

779
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:04,625
Adios, jerks.

780
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,061
It's taking longer than I thought.

781
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:29,113
 - Have you changed your mind by any chance? 
 - Stop with the nonsense. 

782
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:33,296
 I'm the one who desperately wants to end this daily routine. 

783
01:03:35,141 --> 01:03:37,845
 Thank you for waiting. 

784
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:41,362
I've checked the item.

785
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:44,491
It's authentic.

786
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,335
Yes, sir.

787
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:50,370
What are you going to do with it?

788
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:54,446
That's a secret.

789
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:11,457
 We're selling the secret to its original owner. 

790
01:04:29,392 --> 01:04:33,840
 If you're going to throw away your life, give your life to me, 

791
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,205
 then I'll help you. 

792
01:04:49,912 --> 01:04:54,256
What if that old man memorized what it says?

793
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:57,010
Ham Min Heon is old.

794
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:01,091
If he can remember everything, why would he have kept it?

795
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:03,539
The secrets...

796
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:07,939
All the traces of evidence will be deleted.

797
01:05:07,939 --> 01:05:14,042
Even if he argues, it's a senile old man talking gibberish.

798
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:17,325
You're older than him.

799
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:19,779
Don't act up.

800
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:26,100
Will this do?

801
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,352
It's not like it'll make him go broke and force him out on the street.

802
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:34,682
Maybe I should've killed him.

803
01:05:36,831 --> 01:05:38,332
It's been deposited.

804
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:39,401
Already?

805
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:43,118
Yes, they were in a rush.

806
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:45,302
Right.

807
01:05:45,302 --> 01:05:51,054
Everyone has been waiting desperately to get rid of those secrets.

808
01:05:52,012 --> 01:05:53,747
Burn it.

809
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:11,231
   

810
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:13,555
Go to New York.

811
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:18,901
There's a painting at the apartment in Manhattan.

812
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:23,742
A buyer will appear, next Monday,

813
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:27,082
to buy that painting for five million dollars in cash.

814
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:31,693
Finalize that contract.

815
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:35,149
Is it my new work?

816
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:37,463
No.

817
01:06:37,463 --> 01:06:39,842
That's your share.

818
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:44,637
Well done.

819
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:47,831
It's really over now.

820
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:52,766
Why doesn't it feel that way?

821
01:06:52,766 --> 01:06:55,389
If it's over,

822
01:06:55,389 --> 01:07:00,716
why am I still angry and sad?

823
01:07:01,912 --> 01:07:06,876
Because you've lost so much until now.

824
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:11,026
That's why revenge is vain.

825
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:14,807
No matter what you do,

826
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:19,572
it won't undo what already happened.

827
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:07,440
   

828
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,120
   

829
01:09:38,472 --> 01:09:40,355
 Yes, Mom. 

830
01:09:41,101 --> 01:09:43,253
 Were you sleeping? 

831
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:50,614
 You said you made kimchi last time. I'm going to pick it up now. 

832
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:56,034
 No, it's better at night. There's no traffic. 

833
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:06,603
 No, I don't have time other than today. 

834
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:11,053
 Yes, I'll see you soon. 

835
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:12,943
 Bye. 

836
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,980



837
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:38,780
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

838
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,300
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

839
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,790
   

840
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:49,970
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

841
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:53,980
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

842
01:10:54,970 --> 01:11:00,090
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

843
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,870
♫  It's a game of the tongue  ♫

844
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:08,200
♫  My heart is already on the floor  ♫

845
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,210
   

846
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:14,190
♫  Who will laugh at the end?  ♫

847
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,990
♫  On the shoulders of the giants  ♫

848
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,900
♫  Like a blooming flower  ♫

849
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:32,430
♫  The absolute power  ♫

850
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:37,930
♫  That you can't escape from or have  ♫
