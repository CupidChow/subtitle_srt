1
00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:04,691
   

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:05,922
   

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,461
   

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:12,390
   

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,402
- There she is. 
 - She's here.

6
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:16,131
- She's here. 
 - She's here!

7
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:19,572
- There she is. 
 - She's here.

8
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,512
The approval ratings show that you're on the rise for the presidency.

9
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:22,511
Any comment on the ratings?

10
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:24,542
You're investigating your in-laws, the Jusung family,

11
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,051
so some people say this is just a formality. What's your thought on that?

12
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:29,281
Some people believe you're disobeying order to cause a scene,

13
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,022
so you can use that to get into politics.

14
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,281
Any comment on that?

15
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,291
You and your husband are being discussed as presidential candidates,

16
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,262
and this will only make more enemies for you. Do you feel any pressure?

17
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,062
You could be the subject of an internal investigation.

18
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:45,601
You're more used to executing the law,

19
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:50,131
but has it crossed your mind that you might be on the receiving end?

20
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,342
As you're new to this, you will have to provoke people to answer you.

21
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:59,412
You can never ask questions to deadlock your target.

22
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:01,781
Aggressive questions are the best example of that.

23
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:06,681
That's the tip I always give to my juniors when I teach them how to ask the right questions.

24
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:09,492
At the end of the day, prosecutors also ask questions.

25
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:14,061
To conduct an investigation, we must ask questions and get the answers.

26
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,491
Think of it as a conversation.

27
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:21,462
If you can figure out the intention from the answers to your questions,

28
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:25,102
you can be as aggressive as you want toward your target.

29
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:28,012
But aggressive questions prevent the target from opening up,

30
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:31,982
so you lose a lot more than you can gain.

31
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:36,152
As you are clearly motivated, you will be a great reporter.

32
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,251
Bye.

33
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,222
Prosecutor Han.

34
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,352
- Prosecutor Han. 
 - Prosecutor Han.

35
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,292
- Prosecutor Han! 
 - Prosecutor Han.

36
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:43,921
- Prosecutor Han. 
 - Hold on.

37
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,821
- Prosecutor Han. 
 - A comment, please!

38
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:54,660



39
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,802
Tell them to be on standby.

40
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:03,942
She's so annoying because she's always right.

41
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:11,751
   

42
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:14,092
   

43
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,822
You...

44
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:32,641
Hye Ryul, you know what?

45
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:36,111
I'm asking purely out of curiosity.

46
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:39,141
I would like to know the cause of all this.

47
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:42,581
This curiosity is killing me.

48
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,481
Okay? Go on.

49
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,351
Go on!

50
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:52,862
Oh, dear. I can only put up with you because I look after my health.

51
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:55,062
If I didn't,

52
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:02,032
I would have passed out. Okay.

53
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,571
Then answer for me this.

54
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,941
Has our agency become collateral damage for the fight between two sisters?

55
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,242
You can't get along with your sister?

56
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:12,442
Resolve your family issue at home. Why bring your family into my place of work?

57
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,911
You're making it very hard for me to do my job!

58
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:18,321
Are you pressuring me to stop investigating?

59
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:22,552
Look, Hye Ryul. How is this pressuring you?

60
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,161
Do you really think so?

61
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,861
I'm begging you right now, isn't it obvious?

62
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,811
Should I get on my knees?

63
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,302
I have to go see the Prosecutor General soon.

64
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:36,242
The prime minister and the staff from the Blue House are waiting.

65
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,742
Let's end the investigation against Jusung here.

66
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,172
This investigation is completely legal.

67
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:45,541
Why am I hearing about the higher-ups and the Blue House?

68
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:50,151
You really scare me.

69
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,422
After seeing you going after your sister's in-laws,

70
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:56,222
I'm scared that you might even go after your brother's in-laws.

71
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:59,562
Hye Ryul, you know that we'll be in-laws soon, right?

72
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:03,361
Your son and my daughter are dating, with marriage in mind.

73
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,661
You and I will be in-laws,

74
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,961
yet I'm down on my knees begging.

75
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,942
My gosh, Kang Baek never told me about that.

76
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:15,641
What? He didn't?

77
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,841
Come on in.

78
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:27,491
All right. Come on in, Won Kyung.

79
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,961
Sit.

80
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,762
Want it?

81
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,101
Okay.

82
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:46,701
I'm going to put an end to this nonsense today.

83
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,411
Clearly, you two still hold a grudge about your divorce,

84
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:53,211
but why are you trying to settle the grudge by making a mess at my place of work?

85
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,912
What are you doing right now?

86
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,751
I'm working right now.

87
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:01,251
Hye Ryul, hand over the Jusung case to Won Kyung.

88
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,421
- No. 
 - No.

89
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,412
Then there's only one other option.

90
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:09,962
Hye Ryul created this big mess,

91
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:12,062
and I need you to clean it up.

92
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,532
Back in the day, you used to clean up each other's mess at home.

93
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,902
Familiarity can be quite useful.

94
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,512
Better the devil you know. Don't you agree?

95
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:26,362
If you don't agree with this, I'll transfer you to an office in the countryside.

96
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:29,302
You have two options. Choose.

97
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:35,051
I'm going to sit in my own mess.

98
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,021
I'll cover myself in this mess even if it stinks.

99
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,762
Stay far away from me.

100
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,691
Sit back down!

101
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,201
So you're not going to let this go.

102
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:56,241
Don't tell me that you have the slightest hope that you will be the president. Is that it?

103
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,782
You must've liked all the attention you've been getting thanks to that pretty husband of yours,

104
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:04,081
so you're going to steal this opportunity?

105
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:13,421
Hye Ryul! Ms. In-law!

106
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,062
You need to fix this.

107
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:22,371
If you can't fix this and I don't get nominated or don't become an assemblyman,

108
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,612
I'm going to ruin your child's future first.

109
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,141
Why are you taking it out on me?

110
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,341
Must you ask?

111
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,312
I know you provoked her. You started this whole thing.

112
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,682
You asked if she could go after Jusung too!

113
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:35,612
That's because she acted as if she was the symbol of justice.

114
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:39,151
- I thought she was ridiculous. 
 - You'll find out how ridiculous...

115
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,051
I think of you.

116
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,591
Come on. Do you really think she started the investigation because of what I said?

117
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,492
We're talking about the Dragon.

118
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,991
Exactly, so you fix it! You gave her an excuse to do it!

119
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,532
Make that excuse non-binding!

120
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:54,362
You must know that crazy witch's weakness better than anyone, right?

121
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,472
 Her weakness? 

122
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:00,271
 Her weakness... 

123
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:04,881
Wait. Are you asking a father to give away his daughter's weakness?

124
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:09,252
I've done everything in my power to stop the Jusung investigation,

125
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,122
but she won't even budge.

126
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,852
You know what Jusung said?

127
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:16,251
They won't invest in new businesses or recruit any new employees.

128
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,721
They are even threatening us that they will restructure.

129
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:23,931
If I can't fix this, I'm going to be out of a job.

130
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,062
On top of everything, she is being discussed as a presidential candidate?

131
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:31,341
If Jusung does that, given how our economy is struggling,

132
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,312
the approval ratings will take a hit.

133
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:37,042
If it continues, peaceful change of administration becomes impossible.

134
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:40,552
Then if there were to be a bloodbath during that change,

135
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:44,352
will my daughter gain control over the administration?

136
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,822
Are you making jokes right now?

137
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,021
You're so sensitive.

138
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:57,661
By the way, you're not talking about my son-in-law whom you disapprove of.

139
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,131
Professor Na?

140
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:03,042
Well, he's all talk.

141
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:07,902
Once the game begins, I will just let him fall for all the traps he set up.

142
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,152
My job ends there with him.

143
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,682
They are in the same boat as they are married.

144
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,451
Why would you worry now?

145
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:18,122
It sounds like Hye Ryul's weakness is my son-in-law, Na Geun Woo.

146
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,422
Come on. Don't play that game.

147
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,362
Don't you know your own daughter?

148
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:27,492
If anyone was going to get in her way,

149
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,432
she would have gotten rid of them with the exception of her children.

150
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,632
Remember her divorce with Prosecutor Ko?

151
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,731
She already kicked her husband to the curb,

152
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,701
and it'll be easier to get rid of Na Geun Woo. Goodness.

153
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,512
My daughter is indeed extraordinary,

154
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:43,282
but still, her career is just taking off.

155
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,841
Why are you so worried about her?

156
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:51,882
Elections... are like the wind.

157
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,752
It's not a matter of Han Hye Ryul becoming the president.

158
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,422
The fact that she's bringing a new idea to my game is the problem.

159
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:01,262
Besides, does she think she can be the next president?

160
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:04,762
No. Or the one after that? Or will it be the one after that?

161
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,271
Even so.

162
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:10,931
It's only right to rid of any possibility from the get-go,

163
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:16,971
but you're her father, you can't trample on her yourself.

164
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,981
Let me sum up what you just told me.

165
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,121
Before my daughter poses a threat to the administration,

166
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:26,552
it sounds like you want to come after me, her father, first.

167
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:33,821
From olden times, the biggest threat to the throne was a smart heir.

168
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:37,432
I'm old and powerless now, so I have a humble dream

169
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,731
of living my life peacefully as a humble old man.

170
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:44,202
That humble dream is very hard to achieve.

171
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:50,402
I've never seen any former presidents achieve that dream. Not a single one.

172
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,742
My goodness. You're trying to scare me.

173
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:58,082
Oh, right. How is the Christmas Fund going?

174
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,952
Is it being handled nicely?

175
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,791
Pardon?

176
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,162
What did you just say?

177
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:15,232
If you don't know about it, that's a big relief.

178
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,571
That's the best news ever.

179
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:21,371
I'm truly relieved.

180
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,961
Hello, Prosecutor Han.

181
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,691
The two arraignment notices and three news articles, did you get them?

182
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,201
Yes. Right here.

183
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,762
All right.

184
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:46,871
I'll review them at home, wrap it up, and send it to you.

185
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:49,272
Tell Prosecutor Oh to check the inbox tonight.

186
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,902
Sure. I'll carry it to your car.

187
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,341
No, I can carry it.

188
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:55,612
- Work on tomorrow's investigation. 
 - Gosh, this is heavy.

189
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,241
I lift dumbbells to work out.

190
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,081
Goodness.

191
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:01,812
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

192
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,752
Come on, ma'am. You should take it easy.

193
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,321
Gosh.

194
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:21,872
 Doors are closing. 

195
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,282
Please let me.

196
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,461
 Mom, I have something to discuss with you. 

197
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,861
 It's not easy to keep the investigation going. 

198
00:11:56,971 --> 00:12:00,872
 You should talk to your husband regarding this case instead of me. 

199
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:04,341
 You should use him for cases like this. That tool. 

200
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:13,181
The best skill a lawyer needs is reading the situation.

201
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,391
This skill of reading the situation can bring two different results.

202
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,671
Fight or flight?

203
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,241
Is the case worthy of your pursuit to take it all the way,

204
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,682
or should you admit defeat and focus on doing damage control?

205
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,681
You must be objective in reading these situations.

206
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,081
Of course, most lawyers...

207
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:46,021
deeply regret that they chose to fight.

208
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,592
However, even if you have to avoid fighting, you must be willing to learn how to take a punch.

209
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,892
So I plan to train you as fighters.

210
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:59,432
I will give you precedents to study. Write a report about defense strategies and have it ready by next Thursday.

211
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:02,101
You must fight for your client.

212
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:04,272
- Okay! 
 - Okay!

213
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:08,572
I'll prepare for next Thursday's class.

214
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,681
Oh, right. Hold on.

215
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,522
As for next Thursday,

216
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,522
I might have to attend a seminar,

217
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,522
so let's move it to next Tuesday.

218
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:25,620
- Okay! 
 - Okay!

219
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,892
- Yes! 
 - Nice.

220
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,141
As for the criminal code study group,

221
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,041
I just want the four of us to be in the study group.

222
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,342
Come on. Why would we form two separate groups?

223
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,782
This can help other students.

224
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,512
We should let the criminal lawsuit study group join us.

225
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,882
That way, we don't have to schedule sessions or rent rooms separately.

226
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:50,981
- It's more convenient. 
 - Right.

227
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,522
I want a smaller study group with top students.

228
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:58,610
Are you here to study or are you here to separate students based on grades?

229
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:01,991
Listen to yourself. Do you think this is a club?

230
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,991
Be objective.

231
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:10,601
It's true that we need to be on the same level to help each other when we study,

232
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,272
but we can't tell the other study group

233
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:17,372
that only the four of us will study the criminal code cases together.

234
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:20,882
Are you looking out for the whole group or just Nan Hee?

235
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:25,052
I wasn't going to say anything,

236
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:29,022
but why did you bring her to the concert?

237
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,992
What do you mean?

238
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,691
Why are you bringing up the concert?

239
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,732
Hold on.

240
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:37,831
I just don't get this.

241
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,571
Were you trying to get rid of Nan Hee?

242
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,801
If this is about Nan Hee, you can't kick her out.

243
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,601
Ji Yi, it should be you, if anyone.

244
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,512
- What? 
 - Why drag her into this?

245
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,672
Yoo Hyun, I can see right through you.

246
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:52,382
You want her to stay, but not Nan Hee,

247
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:54,851
and it's not about grades.

248
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:59,682
Forget about it! I don't need this study group.

249
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:03,121
You're all here. Shouldn't we go and study?

250
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,132
Let's study more later.

251
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:15,602
Wait.

252
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,241
What's this about?

253
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:23,541
Well, the thing is...

254
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,982
I...

255
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:29,511
Can I... I mean to say...

256
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,310
Can we...

257
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:38,321
I wanted to join your study group!

258
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,061
Our group?

259
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:45,133
I'm sorry, we already got pretty far with the curriculum.

260
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,232
I'm really sorry.

261
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,072
I see.

262
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:55,642
- But I have a bit more experience than... 
 - Let's go.

263
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:59,542
If you want, I can give you a summary note I put together.

264
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,311
Nan Hee.

265
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:05,282
That's from our study session.

266
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,351
No.

267
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:09,792
I put that together on my own and shared it with the group.

268
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,562
Right. You can do that.

269
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:15,062
I'll make a copy of that and give it to you later.

270
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,702
Can I really accept that?

271
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,632
You must have spent a lot of time on that.

272
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:23,971
It's no big deal.

273
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:27,312
I'll be happy if other people can find it helpful too.

274
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:31,612
We're not here to compete. We're here to learn.

275
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:37,052
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

276
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:41,091
My aces! Where are you going? To study?

277
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,721
Do you need any help?

278
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,062
We're good. Thank you.

279
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,461
Wait.

280
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:51,432
I have some notes on the admissibility of evidence...

281
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,902
You can do it!

282
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,771
What are you looking at?

283
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,121
Seeking asylum in the 2020 bar exam.

284
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:14,391
Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act in the 2021 bar exam.

285
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,891
Trends are reflected in the questions of the bar exams.

286
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:20,662
In my opinion, there will be a question about cryptocurrency.

287
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:23,862
Then we should definitely review leading cases of people who invested in Bitcoin.

288
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,263
We should review the revised act on reporting and using specified financial transactions too.

289
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:27,902
Yes. Did you read the article?

290
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,531
A while ago, the national treasury converted impounded Bitcoin to cash.

291
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:34,171
The amount increased by 45 times compared to three years ago.

292
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:35,671
It was 12.2 million dollars.

293
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,712
The price must have skyrocketed.

294
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,712
I should have bought some Bitcoin.

295
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:44,581
Seeing how you're studying the law, you've invested in the safest asset.

296
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:45,851
Is that so?

297
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:48,792
All right. Let's go back to our case.

298
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,692
When you look at the leading case, you must pay attention to this.

299
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,492
Unlike the existing precedents, they charged an additional fine

300
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,361
based on the market price when it was converted to cash.

301
00:17:56,361 --> 00:18:00,162
So I listed relevant scholarly articles and added annotations on the last page.

302
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,231
- You should definitely read that. 
 - Okay.

303
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,112
A package?

304
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,881
Sorry. I need to make a call.

305
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:20,670
Hello?

306
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,952
Yes. Where are you?

307
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:27,692
I see. Okay. Enter the building and turn right.

308
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,601
Let me open it.

309
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,622
How beautiful.

310
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:10,171
I love it.

311
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,401
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes. Totally, I love it.

312
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,571
I mean it. You're the best.

313
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,381
Thank you.

314
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,582
I'm happy that you like it.

315
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,882
I do agree you have good eyes.

316
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,361
You look great in a suit too.

317
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,821
Is that so? Do you think I'll look pretty cool while training in the field?

318
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:35,892
Of course,

319
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:39,961
but you look much better naked.

320
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,502
Do I look like a fierce prosecutor?

321
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:45,172
Yes. If you're the prosecutor, I must plead guilty.

322
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:49,971
As fierce as Han Hye Ryul?

323
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:58,552
I guess she is one fierce woman indeed.

324
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:05,161
Then I'll be a sweet woman to you.

325
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,281
They were just here. Where did they go?

326
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,312
Hey!

327
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,952
It seemed this big to us.

328
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,751
How...

329
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:33,321
Goodness, this is crazy.

330
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,492
- Gosh. 
 - What?

331
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,752
What is going on?

332
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,462
Over there.

333
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,332
Someone...

334
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,601
   

335
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:56,512
Christmas Fund...

336
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,281
Christmas Fund, darn it!

337
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:05,351
What are you doing?

338
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,122
- Why are you bringing that up here? 
 - What do you mean?

339
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:09,891
You're making me anxious.

340
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,921
You can see this is just a suicide case.

341
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,931
No, it's not.

342
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,732
This is a murder case related to Christmas Fund!

343
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,661
Oh, come on.

344
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,401
What?

345
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,832
What is wrong with you?

346
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,471
Christmas Fund

347
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:27,942
safely passed through the eyes of the FSS  (Financial Supervisory Service) and prosecution. 

348
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:29,242
Every single person in Yeouido

349
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,412
has heard the rumor that the Blue House has their back,

350
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,542
so why keep calling for trouble?

351
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,611
Didn't you read his dying note?

352
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:38,181
He lost all his money due to Christmas Fund.

353
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:42,822
He apologized to his family and wrote that he deserved to die!

354
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,121
All his life, he was a diligent and good man,

355
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,092
and he had to write that dying note.

356
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,792
How can you tell me to disregard it?

357
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,332
No, I can't do that.

358
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:52,602
Then what will you do?

359
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,732
I'll get whoever is at the top of that fund.

360
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:58,171
Even if you try, that person will slip through.

361
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:01,642
Hey!

362
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:16,591
- Me too. 
 - Gosh!

363
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:18,961
What are you doing here?

364
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:22,192
You go after murderers and drag them in handcuffs,

365
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:24,542
yet you got startled seeing me?

366
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,031
Murderers never prey on me.

367
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:27,932
Gosh.

368
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:30,402
Ms. Yoon, anything to drink?

369
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:36,042
That punk is a detective and he ran his mouth about my location

370
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:38,011
without any sense of privacy protection!

371
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,711
If others hear it, they might think you're a celebrity or something.

372
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:44,021
Wait. You have to pay first.

373
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,322
Oh, excuse me.

374
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,222
Here.

375
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,192
Come on. Pay for it.

376
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,561
These too.

377
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:54,292
- Now! 
 - Goodness.

378
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:56,842
- Did you scan this? I'll take it. 
 - Yes.

379
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,002
Darn it.

380
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:12,941
Aren't you going home?

381
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,451
Do your parents not care about their only daughter at all?

382
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,221
I need to get a result before next month.

383
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,022
Then go somewhere with a higher chance,

384
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,692
instead of chasing us around.

385
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,422
Your close friend works in the Information Division.

386
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,391
Could there be any info about Han Hye Ryul?

387
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:33,931
You told us about her internal investigation,

388
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:35,602
why ask me that?

389
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:37,441
Snap out of it.

390
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,741
She's the new presidential candidate and Na Geun Woo's woman,

391
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:42,671
but the office wants me to cook something

392
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,141
out of that info about the internal investigation.

393
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,642
Reporters are supposed to report what's true,

394
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,552
so why keep trying to make things up?

395
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,402
Was your dream to be a novelist, perhaps?

396
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:53,352
Be honest. Aren't you curious?

397
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:54,792
Am I the only piece of trash?

398
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,521
- I'm curious too. 
 - See?

399
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,262
Honestly, it can be a good story.

400
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:01,491
Whether or not, we're just dregs.

401
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,331
We live in a totally different world from people so high up.

402
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,362
What can we know?

403
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,981
You got the wrong person this time.

404
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,541
Finish your food, and hurry off.

405
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,171
Get lost.

406
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:20,111
You know Dolphin, right?

407
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:27,592
In the future, I want to run a convenience store,

408
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,052
so I can eat as much convenience food as I want.

409
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,892
And the store will be located in my own building.

410
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:34,862
You wicked girl.

411
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,602
Stop testing the waters!

412
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,762
Dolphin is the actual owner of Christmas Fund,

413
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,201
which recently became an issue.

414
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,472
Fund or whatever,

415
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:46,102
because of him, the victims are suffering and taking their lives.

416
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:49,242
Yet you're trying to bargain with this incident!

417
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,611
Tell me everything you know.

418
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,702
Darn you!

419
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:16,732
Get me what I want from your friend in the Information Division,

420
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:20,771
and I'll get you everything about Dolphin.

421
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,722
Where did they say Dolphin was today?

422
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:28,012
If arrested, he should be behind bars,

423
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,652
but he frequents the prosecutors' office instead.

424
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:34,981
Oh, really?

425
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,451
Keep going.

426
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,931
   

427
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,542
Are you treating your team to a meal today?

428
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,982
As if.

429
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:02,782
It smelled like tangsuyuk  (fried pork or beef)  and yusanseul  (seafood stir-fry)  too.

430
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:03,951
Let me join in.

431
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:06,521
Later. Much later.

432
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,792
What are you doing here? Go!

433
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,492
   

434
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,911
What are you doing?

435
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:43,921
You even ordered a drink?

436
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,192
What's gotten into you?

437
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:48,492
I'll sober up soon. Don't you worry.

438
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:50,662
Their yusanseul is very good.

439
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:52,961
I love their food.

440
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:58,102
Kaoliang liquor  (fermented sorghum wine)  is a must to have with Chinese food.

441
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:00,902
Come join me.

442
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,581
Should I throw you

443
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,321
someone not too small, not too big?

444
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:14,522
   

445
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:17,971
Let me start with someone as high as a chief...

446
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,922
from an office in Gangnam.

447
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:38,672
- How much? 
 - It's 60,000 dollars.

448
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,811
I even have a voice recording.

449
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:44,252
A voice recording too?

450
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:47,921
Goodness, take your time.

451
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,991
It's only the first trial yet.

452
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:54,191
I'm too frustrated to be in jail.

453
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:58,061
We have a lot of time left, so let's take it slow.

454
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,271
Mr. Ko.

455
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,641
How nice is it?

456
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,542
This is what you call catching two birds with one stone.

457
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:12,042
I help you make results and give you intel for your future career.

458
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:17,951
Right, I like it too.

459
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:20,751
I get to enjoy some fresh air thanks to you.

460
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:31,661
Darn it, I love it when it goes down my throat!

461
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,372
One hand washes the other.

462
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:39,101
It's what we call a win-win situation.

463
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:42,341
Why aren't you drinking?

464
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,892
What were you thinking that you got that surprised?

465
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:36,332
No, it's just that you suddenly showed up.

466
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:37,731
Gosh.

467
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:41,932
You don't have to check yourself. You're already cool and handsome,

468
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:44,171
so please look at me.

469
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:47,772
You're always cool too.

470
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,142
Look.

471
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,581
Ta-da! What do you think?

472
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:07,792
What's wrong?

473
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:11,462
No, it just seems new to me,

474
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:14,062
and you rarely wear a formal skirt.

475
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,131
Today's a special day,

476
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:18,902
so I asked Butler Yang to shop for an outfit for me.

477
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:23,241
I'll be showing off my beautiful legs, you see.

478
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:26,841
I'm giving a special speech to law school students today.

479
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:29,582
It's to look pretty for Kang Baek.

480
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:33,952
His friends will be there too, and I want him to feel proud.

481
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:39,121
Do I look like a charismatic prosecutor?

482
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:46,201
As you become a rising presidential candidate,

483
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:48,632
you're now rivals with Candidate Na, your husband.

484
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:50,472
Rumor says you have requested a warrant

485
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,371
against the vice chairman of Jusung. Is it true?

486
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:53,902
Is it true that there has been

487
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:57,882
outside pressure that you could be reappointed if you continue?

488
00:30:57,882 --> 00:30:59,812
You usually enjoy wearing designer clothes,

489
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,882
and your outfit today seems expensive too,

490
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:04,452
won't you narrow down the gap between you and the people

491
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:08,582
by putting up a typical civilian act as politicians do?

492
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:15,832
Ms. Han!

493
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:26,702
She is posing!

494
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:27,972
Ms. Han, over here!

495
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:31,681
- Please look here. 
 - Ms. Han, here too!

496
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,412
Ms. Han!

497
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:36,581
Please say a word!

498
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:39,982
- Ms. Han! 
 - Tell us what you think!

499
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,091
- Ms. Han. 
 - Wait!

500
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:44,852
- Ma'am! 
 - Ms. Han!

501
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:55,671
Come in.

502
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,671
You came, son.

503
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:02,871
Hurry here and sit down.

504
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,972
Here.

505
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:07,542
When did you prepare all these?

506
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,112
I need to leave soon.

507
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:11,382
It's fine. It's just a cup of tea.

508
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:14,592
What would you like to drink? What do you like?

509
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,522
This is coffee,

510
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:19,792
and this is green tea.

511
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:24,231
I try my best not to run into Mom at the Prosecutors' Office.

512
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,662
I already go to where my grandma and dad...

513
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,401
Well... It's okay.

514
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:34,072
Feel free.

515
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:36,411
A lot of people find it unpleasant

516
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,211
that I'm a student where Professor Na teaches.

517
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:40,812
It's sort of a privilege.

518
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:42,512
As if.

519
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:46,452
You passed the exam and got admitted like everyone else did.

520
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:49,492
You're always too conscientious.

521
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,191
Like me.

522
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:56,592
Kang Baek.

523
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:59,532
Now that you're an adult,

524
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,502
let's meet up more often.

525
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:05,202
When you get married, I won't be able to see you anyway.

526
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:07,701
At least, before then...

527
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,212
I'm not going to get married.

528
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:11,742
What?

529
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:14,242
Why?

530
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,122
Because your mom and I got divorced?

531
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,881
No, this has nothing to do with it.

532
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:26,692
I just... have no intention of getting married yet.

533
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:33,562
Well, you're only 26. It's too soon to discuss marriage.

534
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:37,731
- I need to go now. 
 - What?

535
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:41,741
Already?

536
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,372
Okay.

537
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:47,381
Take these and eat them later.

538
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:50,212
I bought enough,

539
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:53,221
so share them with your friends.

540
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,051
Thank you.

541
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,321
Kang Baek.

542
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,721
Yes?

543
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,531
You're on good terms...

544
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:07,161
with Professor Na,

545
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,962
and that's a good thing.

546
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:14,942
Let your family love you and love them back.

547
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:18,572
That's only natural.

548
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:24,982
Don't mind anyone. Anyone at all, okay?

549
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,222
Okay, thank you.

550
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:35,691
 Yes. 

551
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,561
- Sir. 
 - Yes.

552
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:41,232
That's right.

553
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,301
What?

554
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:45,842
Your son will be coming to do the intensive prosecution training?

555
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:48,471
Wow, time flies.

556
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,042
Do you remember?

557
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,341
When you...

558
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,142
When your son got into SNU  (Seoul National University), 

559
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,851
you ditched your afternoon trial so we could have a drink.

560
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:57,951
   

561
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:01,122
You were totally wasted and got naked.

562
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:05,992
Those waiting for the trial must've been frustrated.

563
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:13,601
I mean, no matter how much they waited, the judge didn't show up!

564
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:17,472
Of course, it was the Seoul National University, the trial didn't matter.

565
00:35:17,472 --> 00:35:18,942
We couldn't care less about it.

566
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,511
When he comes to train, I'll make sure to dote on him.

567
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,571
Don't worry. Oh, right.

568
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:24,542
Look.

569
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:29,512
You still remember my daughter's internship at your law firm, right?

570
00:35:29,512 --> 00:35:32,051
Okay, thank you.

571
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:35,151
This is how life works, right? Helping each other...

572
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,451
Wait, hold on. Ms. Han!

573
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,462
I'm almost done.

574
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,162
Hello? Yes.

575
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:47,531
Gosh, there's too much going on with the position I've been after.

576
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,232
Let's meet up for a drink soon.

577
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,801
Okay.

578
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:53,072
Goodbye.

579
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:57,812
Darn, do people think my office is for public service?

580
00:35:57,812 --> 00:36:00,442
Why do they have so much business with me?

581
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:02,482
Gosh!

582
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,592
You can sit closer.

583
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,751
Just stick to the point.

584
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,321
Okay.

585
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:16,861
From now on, I'll be talking about Jusung.

586
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,991
No, wait!

587
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,102
I love your outfit today.

588
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:26,971
- That's sexual harassment. 
 - Okay.

589
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:29,912
Look at me. I'm on my knees. That was to butter you up.

590
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,842
Sorry.

591
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,712
I'll begin then.

592
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,752
If you hear this, you'll be tempted too.

593
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:41,452
I couldn't believe it at first.

594
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:44,991
Aren't you curious? Don't you want to hear it?

595
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:51,362
Jusung has offered CEO Yoo.

596
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:54,301
You know him, right? The right-hand man of Jusung's head.

597
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:58,401
They even helped him evade the hearing, their most favored guy.

598
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:02,251
What are you trying to pull here?

599
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:05,582
Plea bargaining, don't you know it?

600
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:08,381
That system is not accepted in Korea.

601
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:09,511
Don't be an amateur.

602
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,221
Ms. Han, without this source, the Narcotics Team can't take him down.

603
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:14,792
You want to try working there?

604
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,551
Look, that's about a criminal cooperating with an investigation

605
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,892
to reduce their sentence,

606
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,661
but in this case, it's just sacrificing CEO Yoo

607
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,261
to avoid getting arrested.

608
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:28,102
Look, they're family.

609
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:30,072
Family members do that to each other.

610
00:37:30,072 --> 00:37:32,201
Getting arrested on each other's behalves.

611
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,571
Pushing one another to be arrested first.

612
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:36,971
That's what families do.

613
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:40,812
Has it never happened to your family?

614
00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:43,212
You don't think it will ever happen?

615
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,422
Think wisely.

616
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:51,721
I'm giving you a chance.

617
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,571
 Has it never happened to your family? 

618
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,971
 You don't think it will ever happen? 

619
00:38:10,742 --> 00:38:13,441
 How could you do this to me? 

620
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,951
 How could you possibly do this? 

621
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:17,912
 Aunt, please calm down. 

622
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:21,352
 How do you expect me to calm down? 

623
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,691
 I'm about to go to prison! 

624
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:26,261
 This house. This building. 

625
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:28,331
 Part of all those is mine. 

626
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,192
 Taking it away from me wasn't enough 

627
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:33,142
 that you're trying to put me in jail now! 

628
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:38,131
 Father is still alive, so how could you do this to your older sister? 

629
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:40,272
 Older sister, my foot. 

630
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:43,712
 You were born out of wedlock, but I treated you with respect, 

631
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,181
 and you ungratefully siphoned off the money. 

632
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,381
 No. 

633
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:50,881
 I know nothing of it. 

634
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:53,051
 I'm telling you. 

635
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:56,491
 I only handled the taxes as your law firm told me to. 

636
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:59,021
 I really don't know anything. I... 

637
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:02,021
 Gun Do, say something! 

638
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:06,701
 Grandpa! 

639
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:09,832
 Is Grandaunt going to prison? 

640
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:13,701
 Can't you help her? 

641
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:16,542
 She's our family. 

642
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,741
 If she goes to prison, she'll be scared alone. 

643
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:20,781
 Please! 

644
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:23,281
 Grandpa, please help her. 

645
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:25,111
 Hye Ryul! 

646
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:26,781
 Take the girl upstairs! 

647
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,281
 Don't let her come downstairs until we settle everything here. 

648
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,661
 - Hye Ryul!
 - Grandaunt! 

649
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,761
 - Hye Ryul! 
 - Mom! 

650
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,761
 Grandpa. Mom! 

651
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:39,162
 Spare me. 

652
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:42,501
 Help me. Please spare me! 

653
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:17,472
You look graceful

654
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:20,072
in your outfit.

655
00:40:20,772 --> 00:40:23,072
Why don't you look around some other brand stores

656
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,472
at the department store today?

657
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,311
Butler Yang.

658
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:32,632
You don't know what I'll be checking out today.

659
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:36,052
I'll be seeing some jewelry.

660
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:39,801
Just head to the exclusive shop as scheduled.

661
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,492
Do I have a place to run off from here?

662
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:07,612
Are you following me because I might hit it off with some other man?

663
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:10,902
Why don't you put an electronic anklet on me?

664
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:21,431
Madam, shall I bring your usual drink?

665
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,101
Yes, thank you.

666
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:41,822
There was another party tailing "A".

667
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:44,891
I think they are exclusively digging on "A" meeting "B".

668
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,422
Who is that?

669
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:49,022
I'm looking into it at the moment.

670
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:51,132
With so many bread crumbs,

671
00:41:51,132 --> 00:41:54,432
it's not strange for others to trace the tracks.

672
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:56,772
But the schedule seems to be delayed than planned,

673
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:58,132
have you changed your mind by any chance?

674
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,282
Stop with the nonsense.

675
00:42:00,282 --> 00:42:04,112
I'm the one who desperately wants to end this daily routine.

676
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:08,482
I apologize if I have offended you, Ms. Young Sun.

677
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:12,701
I think I told you not to call me by that name.

678
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,822
Thank you for waiting.

679
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:20,492
Thank you.

680
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:21,422
I'll be back.

681
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:24,491
Thank you. Goodbye.

682
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,842
Here's your tea.

683
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,971
No, thank you.

684
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:39,911
I'm getting fed up with this.

685
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:42,852
I'm sorry. Shall I get you another drink?

686
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,751
Did we upset you by any chance?

687
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:49,151
Judge!

688
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:52,922
To save 6,000 dollars,

689
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:55,792
I endured only with pain relief patches,

690
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,531
without going to the hospital even when my body ached.

691
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:02,431
It's precious money that I've made in order to pay

692
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:06,071
for my grandson's college tuition fee.

693
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:10,172
I really believed that it would only take one month.

694
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,781
- Plaintiff. 
 - Yes?

695
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:15,911
Stop telling me this and submit it according to the right format.

696
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:17,152
   

697
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:19,221
Under the order of correction, if you do not correct this

698
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,382
by the next trial date, I will dismiss the case.

699
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:24,751
Gosh, Judge.

700
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:28,062
What do you mean by correction and dismissing the case?

701
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:31,801
I'm not smart and only learned how to read and write!

702
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,931
We will proceed with the next trial. Number 21-G-S-392015.

703
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,371
   

704
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:42,142
Darn it. All that for 6,000 dollars?

705
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:45,781
   

706
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,542
 What is your sister doing? 

707
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,312
 She wants me to make an appearance, or else she'll apply for a warrant! 

708
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:53,152
Han Hye Ryul, that wench!

709
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:59,052
Okay, you asked for it.

710
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:11,001
You came.

711
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,442
The students are waiting.

712
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:16,571
Are you handling the whistle-blower?

713
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,911
Yes, I'm being extra careful.

714
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:22,211
You need to make sure of it or they'll strike us.

715
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:24,681
Knock it out.

716
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:34,022
   

717
00:44:54,712 --> 00:44:56,781
I heard that today is a special day,

718
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,821
so this was a favor I asked Professor Na.

719
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:03,752
It is a bit serious to lecture in front of students, isn't it?

720
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:07,102
Especially when we don't even have a suspect to fight with.

721
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:10,462
Then...

722
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:14,931
   

723
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,902
Here. How's this?

724
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:23,012
You look great!

725
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:25,672
Thank you.

726
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,911
Then, shall we start?

727
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:37,192
Many people think that prosecutors are people who beat up others.

728
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:40,192
It is correct.

729
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,192
"To beat up."

730
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:47,202
It sounds like something that is indecent and crude,

731
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,601
but I was surprised.

732
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:52,842
I thought it would be something close to cursing,

733
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:56,641
but it was a word in the dictionary.

734
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,472
Go ahead, search the word.

735
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:03,211
"To beat up."

736
00:46:04,312 --> 00:46:09,082
First, "to tighten up so that the structure is not loose."

737
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,551
Yes.

738
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:14,061
A prosecutor must be someone like that.

739
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,562
 Investigation and the safety of the vice chairman of Jusung 

740
00:46:17,562 --> 00:46:19,701
 depends on whether or not we secure the evidence 

741
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:21,701
 to definitely prove it. 

742
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:24,431
 Did you check the internal documents on the plans for listing the stocks? 

743
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,101
 Yes, I have finished the investigation 

744
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,812
 by calling all the presidents of the subsidiary companies of Jusung. 

745
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:31,572
 The selected date fits perfectly with the announced date 

746
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:33,542
 of the listing plan considering the stock purchase claim period 

747
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:36,892
 and the period when the favorable factor has its effects. 

748
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:42,152
 We will subpoena the Vice Chairman. 

749
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:43,892
Second,

750
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:49,062
"firmly supervise so that the job or words don't become careless."

751
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,362
   

752
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:03,712
 The most important data shouldn't be saved on the computer or cloud. 

753
00:47:03,712 --> 00:47:06,512
 Save it separately on a flash drive. 

754
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,712
 The facilities team came to fix some facilities in the afternoon, 

755
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:11,152
 and I don't have a good feeling about it. 

756
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:12,882
 Please check for wiretaps in my room tomorrow. 

757
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:14,252
 [Han Hye Ryul 

758
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:23,391
Not being careless.

759
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:28,502
This is the biggest virtue that a prosecutor should have.

760
00:47:28,502 --> 00:47:31,431
The most important thing when investigating a case

761
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:36,872
is to break down the case in detail and go through it one by one

762
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:38,712
without being careless.

763
00:47:38,712 --> 00:47:40,462
You need to beat it up.

764
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:44,881
Now, third.

765
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:47,951
"To beat up furiously. To strike severely."

766
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,351
   

767
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:50,692
Only if we could,

768
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:54,962
everyone has someone that you want to beat up, right?

769
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:58,232
Right? Don't you?

770
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:01,531
Now, those people will never open their mouths without pressure,

771
00:48:01,531 --> 00:48:05,641
apart from physical violence.

772
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:10,972
They must be furiously and severely taught a lesson!

773
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:16,312
 So, you mean to say, you don't remember how this document was made? 

774
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:19,752
 No, I can't remember it at all. 

775
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:26,562
 Wait. Are you saying that you didn't get involved 

776
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:29,161
 in choosing this very important date of stock listing? 

777
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:31,431
 Are you telling me to believe this? 

778
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:35,161
 Then, how did this date come about? 

779
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,082
 We must have chosen an auspicious date. 

780
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:44,942
 Hey, knock him out. 

781
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,581
 On his daughter getting early acceptance from college, 

782
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:49,212
 on his son going to an Ivy League school, 

783
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:52,152
 on him getting funding from Christmas Fund. 

784
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:54,821
 Knock him out on everything. 

785
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:02,691
Of course, there are things we must keep in mind.

786
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:04,491
If you beat someone up like this,

787
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:08,301
you should never approach it with self-conviction or emotion.

788
00:49:08,301 --> 00:49:09,672
If you don't back it up with reasonable grounds

789
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:15,071
and objective yet solid legal justification,

790
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,472
you will also beat yourself up

791
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:22,212
as stated in the fourth meaning.

792
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,181
I have a question.

793
00:49:28,122 --> 00:49:30,222
Yes, go ahead.

794
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:35,362
What do you think of those who ignore all circumstances

795
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:38,192
that are reasonable and objective, but have a conclusion ready

796
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:39,961
in favor of one side?

797
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:43,572
To be exact, the side that has money and power?

798
00:49:43,572 --> 00:49:46,602
What is your opinion on those who fail to have an unbiased view

799
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:48,741
and fail justice?

800
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:54,372
   

801
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:00,752
Well, I can't deny that there are legal bodies like that.

802
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:05,822
They should bear the responsibility and pay the price for what they did.

803
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:08,991
According to your expression,

804
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:13,091
it is right for such legal bodies to have their lives beaten up.

805
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,181
Isn't that what it means?

806
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,671
   

807
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:26,142
You're truly great.

808
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,011
I know.

809
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:34,282
I really...

810
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:38,251
respect you.

811
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,392
Thank you.

812
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,692
I hope today will be a good opportunity for you

813
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:46,301
to experience the field work.

814
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:48,262
Thank you.

815
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,472
   

816
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:05,482
It must be nice to have someone like her as your mom.

817
00:51:16,432 --> 00:51:19,791
Jusung would like to meet you.

818
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:23,501
Not now.

819
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:27,342
Even if they get prosecuted, the prosecutor in charge is my daughter.

820
00:51:27,342 --> 00:51:29,542
That will cause a conflict.

821
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,042
Why would I step out when I can't handle it?

822
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,781
That will only cause a misunderstanding.

823
00:51:33,781 --> 00:51:37,652
You see, if people misunderstand me after sleeping with someone,

824
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:39,221
I wouldn't be so upset.

825
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,121
But if people misunderstand me even before I sleep with them,

826
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:43,491
it drives me crazy.

827
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,161
That would drive anyone crazy to death.

828
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,721
You can't even appeal to the law.

829
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:52,361
Right. Things that we can't appeal to the law, that's most resentful.

830
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:55,231
All I have is money and law.

831
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:58,372
I'll buy time.

832
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:02,001
Yes. Time is money.

833
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:07,741
When one suffocates up to here, "If I die now,

834
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:09,982
all that money is worthless."

835
00:52:09,982 --> 00:52:12,512
Then one finally realizes.

836
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:13,652
Yes.

837
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:17,252
Until Jusung is suffocated enough to show the whites of their eyes,

838
00:52:17,252 --> 00:52:20,221
I will wait on it.

839
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,862
Hey.

840
00:52:21,862 --> 00:52:24,862
You should've joined my family.

841
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:28,232
You'd make a perfect son-in-law.

842
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:32,402
Who would've known he was sly enough to steal my spot?

843
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:35,872
So you should've knocked her up first.

844
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:37,011
Because her grandpa is a fanatic,

845
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:41,242
this family never allows abortion or gay.

846
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,712
When he was in Supreme Court,

847
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:46,362
we couldn't even talk about anything against the abortion regulation.

848
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,692
What's so wrong with me being a fanatic?

849
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,962
Father, you should've told me you were coming.

850
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:56,792
Are you expecting me to worry about you in my own office?

851
00:52:56,792 --> 00:53:00,561
I told you to watch your mouth at all times.

852
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:03,931
I will get going now.

853
00:53:07,272 --> 00:53:09,042
What brings you here?

854
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:12,212
Because you weren't reliable.

855
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:16,982
Don't even think about calling Jusung.

856
00:53:16,982 --> 00:53:20,051
Of course. I'd never do that considering the current situation.

857
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:25,151
Don't think it'll get you more money over time.

858
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:27,361
Is that how it works?

859
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:30,462
Now that I think about it, it makes sense.

860
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:34,031
You think I don't know you?

861
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:37,001
Jusung knows you too.

862
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:40,701
I turned them down when they called.

863
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:43,101
I can't take their case.

864
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:46,842
Father, they're still my in-laws. What will that make of Hye Ryul?

865
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:49,042
It's Hye Ryul's job!

866
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:51,882
Then think what's best for Hye Ryul.

867
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:56,522
Gwang Jeon is regretting her whole life for marrying you.

868
00:53:56,522 --> 00:53:59,621
I can never let that happen again.

869
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:03,661
Only if Gwang Jeon wasn't a woman.

870
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:09,871
   

871
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:14,301
You never age.

872
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:17,572
Skincare technology is improving every day.

873
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:23,481
Your elegant speech is still the same.

874
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:30,451
Now that you have verified I haven't changed, tell me why you're here.

875
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,222
Yes.

876
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:36,192
I don't dare to be calculative in front of you.

877
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,761
I will be straightforward.

878
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:42,502
Please stop Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul.

879
00:54:42,502 --> 00:54:47,701
You're the only person who can persuade her.

880
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:54,712
Someone must've promised you a title.

881
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:57,781
A major anchor of a broadcasting station

882
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:01,882
gives up on staying neutral and volunteers to be a pigeon.

883
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:06,762
I'm not just a pigeon.

884
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:10,062
I'm also a blackmailer.

885
00:55:10,062 --> 00:55:11,992
She should stop now.

886
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:15,361
That's best for her.

887
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:19,642
Director Yoon. This is purely my work habit,

888
00:55:19,642 --> 00:55:22,572
but let me correct you because it bugs me.

889
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:26,312
There is a legal difference between threat and blackmail.

890
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:32,381
People often use "threat" and "blackmail" together to scare the other.

891
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:37,752
Blackmailing legally means an illegal act to gain wealth.

892
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,092
Money must be involved.

893
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:45,431
Unless you're here to extort money today, you're only threatening me.

894
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:50,802
When your greed to remain the same is too excessive,

895
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:54,041
it becomes an elder's greed.

896
00:55:57,911 --> 00:55:59,941
I see.

897
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,542
An elder's greed?

898
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:08,681
That's defamation and an insult.

899
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:15,962
   

900
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:26,781
What are you doing here? You should've called me.

901
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:30,302
You're not happy to see me?

902
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:33,882
Because I wasn't expecting you...

903
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:37,551
What is this dress?

904
00:56:39,951 --> 00:56:41,821
Are you a pervert,

905
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:44,722
or were you too lazy?

906
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:47,662
- That's not it. 
 - Then?

907
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:50,642
What were you thinking? Did you want to compare me?

908
00:56:50,642 --> 00:56:53,331
That's really not what I meant.

909
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,801
Rip it.

910
00:56:57,801 --> 00:57:00,402
If that's not it, rip it!

911
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:07,341
Piece of trash. Forget it!

912
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,681
It's trash!

913
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:11,612
- Nan Hee. 
 - I hate it!

914
00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:13,581
Nan Hee!

915
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:19,751
Do you know how terrible it was?

916
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,961
What is this?

917
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:25,362
I'm sorry, Nan Hee.

918
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,601
This is wrong.

919
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:32,471
Yes. You're right.

920
00:57:37,611 --> 00:57:39,872
You love me, right?

921
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,111
Of course.

922
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:45,951
No.

923
00:57:45,951 --> 00:57:48,251
Say you love me.

924
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:52,251
I love you.

925
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:50,551
- You cannot enter. 
 - Move back.

926
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,982
- Move back. 
 - You cannot enter.

927
00:58:52,982 --> 00:58:54,181
- Move back. 
 - Move back.

928
00:58:54,181 --> 00:58:56,322
- No photos are allowed. 
 - Move back.

929
00:58:56,322 --> 00:58:57,692
Move back. It's dangerous.

930
00:58:57,692 --> 00:58:58,991
- Is that the body? 
 - No pictures.

931
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:00,522
- Don't take pictures. 
 - No pictures.

932
00:59:00,522 --> 00:59:01,962
Stop taking pictures.

933
00:59:01,962 --> 00:59:03,562
   

934
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:04,891
Hey, hey!

935
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:08,531
I told you to collect evidence, not damage the scene!

936
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:12,431
This is no sight to see. What are you doing?

937
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:15,201
- Stop taking pictures! 
 - No pictures please.

938
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:17,471
Before you get arrested

939
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,112
for defamation of the dead and obstruction of justice!

940
00:59:20,112 --> 00:59:23,351
- Seriously. 
 - Please go down.

941
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,652
Yes. This way.

942
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:29,822
You're really determined to spread the word.

943
00:59:29,822 --> 00:59:34,280
What is it that you really want?

944
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:40,540
