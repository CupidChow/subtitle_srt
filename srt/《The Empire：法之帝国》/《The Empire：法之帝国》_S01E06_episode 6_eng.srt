1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:09,010



2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,376
Mom!

3
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:23,399
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

4
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:28,989
You were here?

5
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,495
Yes.

6
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:37,291
Kang Baek is here because he knows you like this place.

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,591
Yes, I knew this was your favorite place.

8
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,491
We got the result for the mock trial preliminary round.

9
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,291
We passed it easily.

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,571
I see. Congratulations.

11
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,231
- Good job. 
 - Thank you.

12
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,171
So I said I would treat them.

13
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:58,012
It seems you just started.

14
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:01,191
May we join you?

15
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,511
I could get a more expensive dish that way,

16
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,496
right?

17
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:09,922
I was actually worried we would be done after the appetizer.

18
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,822
This place is really expensive.

19
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,122
You'll be surprised, once, by the flavor, and twice, by the price.

20
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:15,261
Come on.

21
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,692
You said I had to try their beef risotto.

22
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,061
Now you say that?

23
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,569
That's not the problem right now.

24
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,402
They look too romantic for us to join them.

25
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,438
You think so?

26
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,492
Were you having an important conversation?

27
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,382
No.

28
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:40,182
I would love to have a meal with my husband, my son, and his friends.

29
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:44,331
It sounds like a great idea. I hope you're okay with that.

30
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,922
Sure.

31
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:49,566
They probably don't get to go on a date like this often.

32
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,861
Maybe we're interrupting them.

33
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,162
We're sorry.

34
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:53,632
Gosh, don't be sorry.

35
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:58,035
It's been a while since I saw you. Let me treat you to a meal.

36
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,409
   

37
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:14,011
Watching them eat risotto reminds me of the squid ink risotto.

38
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,882
Do you remember the one in Venice?

39
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:17,951
Of course.

40
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,622
You really liked that dish.

41
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,122
It was really funny back then.

42
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:23,921
The risotto looked really black.

43
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,269
All of our mouths got black.

44
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,132
- Right. 
 - I have a photo from that trip.

45
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,232
Hold on.

46
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,801
You guys were wiping each other's mouths while smiling.

47
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,201
It was such a lovely sight,

48
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,502
so I took a photo.

49
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:38,041
Is that so? You have a photo of that?

50
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,105
- Here. 
 - Let me see.

51
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,580
Gosh, no way! Look at that!

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,923
Goodness!

53
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,570
Seriously.

54
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:56,891
Look.

55
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,392
This was taken only a few years ago,

56
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:01,252
but they look like a couple in their 20s.

57
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:04,521
Gosh. Isn't that from a photoshoot?

58
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:10,582
We should go to Italy once we pass the bar exam.

59
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:12,942
- Italy? 
 - Count me in too.

60
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,511
Do you want to tag along?

61
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,511
Of course, he should come.

62
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,451
Sweetie, it should just be the two of us.

63
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,811
Sweetie, I told you to stop clinging on to me.

64
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,422
Naples, Rome, and Milan, we should travel all over Italy.

65
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:30,892
I want to ride the gondola at night in Venice.

66
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:34,361
Why don't we travel all over Europe, not just Italy?

67
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,101
I want to visit Eastern Europe too.

68
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,261
Have you been to the Czech Republic?

69
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:40,841
I've only been to the Czech Republic, but I'd love to visit again.

70
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,402
When I was in the Czech Republic last time,

71
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,811
I was a minor, so I couldn't even drink.

72
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,082
Then you can't say you've been to the Czech Republic.

73
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:52,652
I want to be in Europe on St. Patrick's Day,

74
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:53,982
so I can go to Ireland.

75
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:57,565
- That sounds fun. We should go. 
 - Right?

76
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,449
Kang Baek,

77
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,600
bring Ji Yi home this weekend.

78
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:15,942
Pardon?

79
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:20,037
What I wanted to discuss with you was about Kang Baek and Ji Yi.

80
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:22,982
Once they pass the bar exam, we should send them abroad to study.

81
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:26,382
Why don't we have them pass the bar exam in the US too?

82
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,082
They can enjoy their honeymoon phase in the US too

83
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:32,321
or we can follow them to the US as well. I can go there for training,

84
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,921
and you can take a sabbatical.

85
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,491
Your grandma and other family members want to meet her too.

86
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:42,491
Bring her home this weekend, okay? You should go and pick her up.

87
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,701
 How should I destroy that witch? 

88
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:54,882
Now that she's on my back, these guards are changing their stance too.

89
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,841
They don't think I'm important anymore.

90
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,451
That makes all the difference here.

91
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,982
They will do anything to please people in power,

92
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,382
but once these guards write you off, they treat you like some criminal

93
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:05,391
and they shove their little title against you.

94
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:08,231
Do you know how annoying this is?

95
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,216
How come you're so quiet?

96
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:16,261
Can't you see this?

97
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,173
Hey!

98
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:24,842
They're treating me like some two-bit thug, okay?

99
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:27,042
I'm Ji Joon Ki. I'm Dolphin!

100
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:30,021
I used to handle billions of dollars!

101
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,651
You see, this place is full of people like you.

102
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,339
Even these chairmen who had billions of dollars

103
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,891
come in and out of this place.

104
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,135
Think carefully.

105
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,062
For decades, you've seen the difference

106
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:49,361
between people who go down in flames and people who come out and still hit it big.

107
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,572
They're really good at distinguishing the two.

108
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:57,172
They know if you still got it or you're rotting in here.

109
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:02,632
Are you telling me I'm rotting in here?

110
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:07,303
Come on!

111
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:12,875
Losing your temper like this is being observed too.

112
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,411
Some of them can stay calm because they have people doing their bidding.

113
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,971
They never have to raise their voices like you.

114
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:50,851
Are you feeling me out?

115
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:53,139
Chairman Ji,

116
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,501
as I still show you respect and call you Chairman Ji, you better come to your senses.

117
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,672
It only takes a second for you to go from Chairman Ji to Mr. Ji.

118
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,636
You little...

119
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,214
Work with me.

120
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:09,842
Just trust me, okay?

121
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,412
Has he gone mad?

122
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,322
How could he mention me? I have nothing to do with that!

123
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:19,252
I have never met that jerk!

124
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,552
You can't say that right now.

125
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:25,921
They just gave me a photo of you and Dolphin playing golf together.

126
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:28,361
Gosh. Darn it!

127
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,802
You shouldn't say anything for now. Not a word.

128
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:36,801
Since the cat is out of the bag, we don't know what he has.

129
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,412
Are you sure I can trust this jerk, Attorney Nam?

130
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:43,472
What can you do then? Do you have another option?

131
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,611
Not trusting your ally is the riskiest move at times like this.

132
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,652
You better keep your mouth shut.

133
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,081
- Gosh, when is he going to show up? 
 - Where is he?

134
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:54,191
- I think he's coming. 
 - Is that the black car there?

135
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,022
- He's coming in! 
 - Hey, he's here!

136
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,161
- Get close! 
 - Take photos now!

137
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,165
- Get close! 
 - Be careful!

138
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:03,701
- Right here! 
 - Mr. Ahn!

139
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,402
- Mr. Ahn! 
 - Mr. Ahn!

140
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,471
- Mr. Ahn Ji Hwan! 
 - Mr. Ahn!

141
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,872
Do you deny accepting political bribes from Chairman Ji Joon Ki, regarding Christmas Fund?

142
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,711
You're suspected of having received a large sum of money,

143
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,442
do you have any comments about that?

144
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,742
A significant sum of the money can't be traced,

145
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,652
and it's rumored that politicians have gotten their hands on it.

146
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,151
What do you think about the speculation that it's being used for the presidential campaign?

147
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:24,721
We have acquired the statement that he treated you to several rounds of golf and gave you cash in person.

148
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,183
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,591
Gosh, I don't know him!

150
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,392
You got the wrong guy. Leave me alone!

151
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:35,032
- Mr. Ahn! 
 - Mr. Ahn!

152
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:36,852
That fool!

153
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:40,172
How could he bite?

154
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,777
Come on!

155
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:46,642
He dropped the honorifics to the reporters.

156
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:49,581
He's over, darn it! I sided with the wrong guy.

157
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,898
Han Hye Ryul won, darn it!

158
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,422
How can you laugh right now? You and I are in the same boat,

159
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,851
and that boat is going down, you fool!

160
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,991
What happened to all the liquor and stir-fried seafood you fed him?

161
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:06,140
Il,

162
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,701
how can you be a politician with that temper of yours?

163
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:12,505
Do you think Han Hye Ryul is over the moon right now?

164
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:24,112
Well, isn't this good for us?

165
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,052
Should I summon Mr. Ahn?

166
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,391
Prosecutor Oh,

167
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,392
do you think the Senior Secretary of the Blue House is your friend?

168
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,491
Do you think we can just summon him?

169
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,631
This is where we bring in criminals and put them in jail.

170
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:39,861
We have no evidence or proof.

171
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:43,001
Why should we take some criminal's threat seriously

172
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:46,397
when he has nothing to lose from this?

173
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:52,512
Dolphin, this jerk, is threatening the higher-ups himself

174
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,272
without even addressing us in the middle.

175
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:56,841
Check the dates when he met with his lawyer,

176
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:59,351
and check every single lawyer who was there on those dates.

177
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:05,575
I need you to find out all the lawyers who are messing with us.

178
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,691
 Good job. 

179
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,368
I bet everyone, including the VIP, is scared by now.

180
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:15,392
Are you sure people will forget about Jusung's scandal with this ploy?

181
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:16,802
Don't worry.

182
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:21,902
I specialize in blurring the truth, dragging it out, and fizzling it out.

183
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:26,241
The cases I handled weren't solved because they were innocent.

184
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,661
This is how you escape the law.

185
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,142
Dad!

186
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,882
Goodness, my daughter.

187
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,721
- You look beautiful when you smile. 
 - Gosh.

188
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,522
Dad, thank you.

189
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,892
Don't mention it.

190
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:41,084
This is nothing for my daughter.

191
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:47,862
Then, for a week, I'll be carefully driving it in this direction.

192
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,001
Okay.

193
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,961
You know how to grab people by their throats, right?

194
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,402
You have to make sure they can't breathe,

195
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:57,871
and then give them a breath of fresh air,

196
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:01,071
so they realize how oxygen is precious and great.

197
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:03,081
You must make them experience the suffering.

198
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:06,525
Only then will they be grateful to be alive.

199
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:09,721
Don't worry,

200
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,691
- this will go without a hitch. 
 - Okay.

201
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,662
Thank you so much, Mr. Nam.

202
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:17,013
Gosh, don't mention it.

203
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:18,231
Judge Han,

204
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:20,561
a mere "thank you" can't replace your gratitude.

205
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:26,765
You ought to put aside a great position on the legal team in Jusung, for Mr. Nam.

206
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,201
Of course.

207
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,171
Gosh, it's all right.

208
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,596
Let me pour you a drink.

209
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:44,197
- Are they good? 
 - Yes.

210
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,662
Okay.

211
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,662
Let me pass through.

212
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:54,545
   

213
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,169
Okay, put it in.

214
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:12,267
   

215
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,612
- Good work. 
 - Sure.

216
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,022
It looks like we're having a party.

217
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:20,522
I was told to pay special attention to it.

218
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:24,221
This goes beyond that. You're making a huge fuss.

219
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,461
I heard Ji Yi was paying us a visit.

220
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:29,231
Yes, that's right.

221
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:34,132
I guess the chief prosecutor of the Central District Prosecutors' Office must be an important man.

222
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,071
- Isn't that a live snapper? 
 - Yes.

223
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:43,876
We're serving snapper carpaccio for the appetizer.

224
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,701
I don't feel like having raw food today.

225
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:51,381
That's one of Ji Yi's favorite dishes.

226
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,792
I said I didn't want it.

227
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,227
I said, not today!

228
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,831
This dish was specified for the meal.

229
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,032
- By whom? 
 - Senior Prosecutor Han.

230
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:08,601
Because Hye Ryul said so...

231
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,765
What's going on?

232
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,841
You're here.

233
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:18,252
I guess Hye Ryul has the final say about everything.

234
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:20,012
My stomach has been feeling a bit off.

235
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,681
The thought of having raw food makes me nauseous.

236
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:27,492
Since Hye Ryul picked the dish, she couldn't exclude it from the menu,

237
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:30,321
so I'll stay in my room for dinner.

238
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,492
What on earth is going on?

239
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,362
The great-granddaughter who will keep our bloodline going

240
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:36,831
will be coming to our house to see us.

241
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:39,272
You can't possibly stay in your room.

242
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:43,202
Butler Yang, she is feeling nauseous.

243
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:45,542
I'm sure you won't have a problem excluding that dish.

244
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,471
You have tons of ingredients here.

245
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,742
Why can't you do it?

246
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:51,561
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,627
I guess it was a simple matter.

248
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:02,961
Without you, I'm nothing in this house,

249
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:06,262
so your health must be our top priority.

250
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,331
You're the only one who cares this much about my health.

251
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,132
Are you feeling unwell?

252
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,402
The smell of fish made me so nauseous.

253
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,971
Oh, no! Let's go and lie down for a bit.

254
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,612
You should stay by my side.

255
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:20,724
Of course.

256
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,578
This looks nice.

257
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:42,662
Wait. No.

258
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,801
You can't look too handsome and young.

259
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,032
What if she thinks she's coming here to see you?

260
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,841
I'm sure you have a lot on your plate.

261
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,912
Why didn't you postpone the dinner to some other time?

262
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:55,132
You have other things to worry about.

263
00:14:56,042 --> 00:15:00,012
Exactly. Today is an important day.

264
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:05,121
I, Han Hye Ryul, will tell Ji Yi, today,

265
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:09,085
that I'm struggling and will admit my defeat.

266
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:12,991
I'll do it for Kang Baek's sake.

267
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:17,162
If something goes wrong, as long as he has Ji Yi,

268
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:21,114
Kang Baek will be safe.

269
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,214
I understand.

270
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:31,412
I don't want a lot from you, honey.

271
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,382
I just need you

272
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:37,782
to be a shield for my son, Kang Baek.

273
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,905
That's all I need.

274
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:45,322
Sure.

275
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,785
I will be.

276
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,862
Thank you.

277
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:13,892
I had no idea Ji Yi was this important to us.

278
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:17,521
I'll prepare a fancier meal when you bring your future husband.

279
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:21,531
We'll set up a fluttering awning in the garden, okay?

280
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:25,501
Instead of a string quartet, we'll put grand pianos.

281
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:28,231
We'll have a piano quartet. What do you think?

282
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:31,402
I didn't know you could make jokes.

283
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,172
You're so approachable now.

284
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,142
Gosh. When was I ever unapproachable?

285
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:39,951
You were. You were so unapproachable

286
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:43,522
because you were a queen, a deity!

287
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,291
- Goodness! 
 - You're killing me here.

288
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,392
I wonder if people know

289
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,791
how silly you can be. So silly!

290
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,636
Be quiet.

291
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,112
Right?

292
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:11,681
Gosh. We must be having an important guest.

293
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,981
When I come in and out of the house,

294
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:16,021
only the security cameras welcome me home. Gosh.

295
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,852
You can wait inside.

296
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,191
Don't be like that.

297
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,592
If you think about it,

298
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:25,021
I'm the only one who truly welcomes Ji Yi to our family.

299
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:28,332
You guys are all making a fuss when you're hiding a sword each.

300
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,356
Goodness.

301
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:40,495
I thought Ji Yi was coming.

302
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:45,611
Right, that's not Ji Yi.

303
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:47,541
Ji Yi wouldn't have become that pretty overnight.

304
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,126
Stop it!

305
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,565
Kang Baek,

306
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,091
where is Ji Yi?

307
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:01,352
Well, I didn't think this occasion was for Ji Yi.

308
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,591
What are you talking about?

309
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,031
I never got a chance to tell you.

310
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:09,031
Let me officially introduce her to you.

311
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,056
This is my girlfriend.

312
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,215
Hello, I'm Hong Nan Hee.

313
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,886
Kang Baek and I are in a serious relationship.

314
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,062
Don't be so rude.

315
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:41,592
We can't keep our guest standing at the door. Show her inside.

316
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,962
Was it Nan Hee?

317
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:46,514
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

318
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:04,103
Let's talk more about the details, slowly, as we have dinner.

319
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:09,862
Today's star is Kang Baek, so naturally, Hye Ryul is the host.

320
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:14,431
Why don't we let her say grace on our behalves?

321
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:17,727
Sure. Go ahead, Hye Ryul.

322
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,771
All right.

323
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:24,842
For my son, Kang Baek,

324
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:29,681
I will say grace by citing a few lines from Proverbs,

325
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:33,322
which we must bear in mind throughout our lives.

326
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:42,162
"My son, pay attention to my wisdom,

327
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,162
turn your ear to my words of insight,

328
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,461
that you may maintain discretion

329
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:52,672
and your lips may preserve knowledge."

330
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:54,628
- Amen. 
 - Amen.

331
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,702
"For the lips of the adulterous woman

332
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:03,082
drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,

333
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:05,382
but in the end, she is bitter as gall,

334
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:09,706
sharp as a double-edged sword.

335
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:21,256
Her feet go down to death,

336
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:23,671
and her steps

337
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:26,862
lead straight to the grave.

338
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,771
Now then, my sons,

339
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,848
listen to me.

340
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:35,718
Do not turn aside from what I say,

341
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:39,348
lest you lose your honor to others

342
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:41,392
and your dignity

343
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:45,310
to one who is cruel."

344
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,000
Amen.

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,192
It's such an impressive line.

346
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,862
Mom, Kang Baek isn't even married yet.

347
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:55,002
Why would you talk about adultery here?

348
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:58,265
That was such a grateful prayer.

349
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,386
You heard her, right?

350
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:04,142
Then with a sense of gratitude, may I say grace

351
00:22:04,142 --> 00:22:07,172
with my favorite lines from Proverbs?

352
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:10,211
- What... 
 - Oh my, you must be quite faithful,

353
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,481
if you can respond right away with the same book of the Bible.

354
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:17,322
I will also cite a few lines to say grace.

355
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,737
I can't wait.

356
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:32,802
"Better a dry crust with peace and quiet,

357
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:37,181
than a house full of feasting with strife.

358
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,382
Whoever mocks the poor

359
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:47,261
shows contempt for their Maker.

360
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,751
Whoever gloats over disaster

361
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:53,651
will not go unpunished.

362
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,291
Acquitting the guilty

363
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,731
and condemning the innocent,

364
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,461
the Lord detests them both.

365
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,162
It is not good to be partial to the wicked,

366
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:06,902
and so, deprive the innocent of justice.

367
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:10,402
Rescue those being led away to death.

368
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:13,726
Hold back those staggering toward slaughter.

369
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,582
It will go well with those who convict the guilty,

370
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:22,842
and rich blessings will come to them.

371
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,491
If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction,

372
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,291
even their prayers are detestable.

373
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,422
For riches do not endure forever,

374
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:31,341
and a crown is

375
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:34,545
not secure for all generations."

376
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:51,481
Who says grace in such a threatening way?

377
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,841
It sounds more like a curse than a prayer.

378
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,052
What brought you here unannounced?

379
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:00,951
I heard Ji Yi was visiting the house today.

380
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:03,892
I thought I should at least try

381
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:08,032
to win her favor or something and ran over here,

382
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,062
but who is this beauty?

383
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:13,672
Aunt, this is my girlfriend.

384
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:17,067
Wow, good for you!

385
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:21,402
Strangely, she looks somewhat similar.

386
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:24,241
I have a common face.

387
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:27,601
No way. It's never common to have such a beautiful face.

388
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:30,352
Now that you're here, why don't you take a seat?

389
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:34,331
Since you came, join us for dinner.

390
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:40,035
I'm not that tactless enough to mingle with those who unwelcome me.

391
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:43,632
By the way, why do you look so down?

392
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,872
It's supposed to be a happy family dinner, right?

393
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:50,842
Moo Ryul, let's go. I'll see you out.

394
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:54,602
Mom, I'll leave. Off I go.

395
00:24:56,882 --> 00:25:01,161
Bye. Bye-bye, folks!

396
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,976
Ms. Hong,

397
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:16,083
why don't we choose wine together?

398
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,990
Sure, let's do that.

399
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,012
Are you going to go yourself?

400
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:25,221
Don't tell me you will go.

401
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:36,198
I don't know why I'm craving soju.

402
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,301
What do you think you are doing?

403
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:41,652
I can't believe you held it back until we came all the way here.

404
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:44,832
I asked you a question.

405
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:48,449
I plan to marry Kang Baek.

406
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,162
You're insane.

407
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:54,791
It might be unpleasant for you to have your husband's ex

408
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,531
as your daughter-in-law,

409
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,076
but I don't really mind it.

410
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,771
Now you're being much more realistic.

411
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:08,771
I wondered if you would put up a fake smile

412
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:11,312
behind the thick mask of refinement and dignity.

413
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:13,251
Don't mess with Kang Baek.

414
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:16,922
Then was it okay when I messed with Mr. Na?

415
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:19,641
His heart is going to break!

416
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,791
What do you gain from this? What is it that you want?

417
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,207
Just why are you doing this to me?

418
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:26,892
I got greedy.

419
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:30,639
I never had such an intention, but I got greedy.

420
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,095
From the very beginning,

421
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:37,941
I didn't think of having some kind of relationship with Mr. Na.

422
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:43,477
To hold onto that empty hope, I was overly clever and realistic.

423
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,254
And what?

424
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:47,820
Then I was drawn to him.

425
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,425
Being drawn to someone

426
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,706
was not something I could control.

427
00:27:55,721 --> 00:28:02,062
Your explanation cannot justify that relationship.

428
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,446
A teacher and a student. Married, at that.

429
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:10,771
It's just that you have a lousy sense of morality.

430
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,051
A sense of morality, did you say?

431
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,882
Compassion.

432
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,612
Isn't that the most basic aspect of morality?

433
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:21,732
Total compassion started our relationship.

434
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:25,082
I felt bad for Na Geun Woo.

435
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,152
What?

436
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:28,422
Making love was more like me comforting him.

437
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,126
Why you little...

438
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:35,409
Have you never thought that you'd be too much for him?

439
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,192
Not to mention your family.

440
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:43,126
He's just a selfish and weak man.

441
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:47,333
You asked me if I could handle him.

442
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,592
That's a wrong question.

443
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:52,511
You should've asked if he could handle you.

444
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,580
Shut your mouth!

445
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:58,021
Don't act like you're something.

446
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,791
You are a nobody!

447
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,671
Stop yelling at me,

448
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:04,211
or are you interrogating me now?

449
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:08,328
Why on earth are you doing this?

450
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:11,031
Why are you going this far?

451
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,971
Don't you remember?

452
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:15,798
You patronized me that day

453
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,942
by buying me expensive and fancy bottles of wine.

454
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:22,135
I wasn't really interested in getting married

455
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,862
but that turned out to be the answer.

456
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:31,352
You see,

457
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:35,503
I got greedy over a life like this.

458
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:41,482
If I marry Kang Baek, this will be my life.

459
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:48,382
I cut my own throat?

460
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:52,735
That may be your point, but do you actually think it's possible?

461
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:57,751
Tell me. Do you think you can have him by doing this?

462
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:07,931
If I can't have him,

463
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,859
I will destroy him, at least.

464
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:19,057
But you see,

465
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:23,636
Kang Baek and I love each other.

466
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:32,302
So accept it,

467
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,766
Mother.

468
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:54,832
They wouldn't be killing one another in the storage, would they?

469
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:56,072
What are you saying?

470
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:58,642
There's no need to take this seriously.

471
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:01,662
- As if it can actually happen. 
 - Your mouth!

472
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:06,166
Honey, watch your blood pressure.

473
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,242
- I'll go check. 
 - No, I'll go.

474
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,705
Hye Ryul!

475
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:20,191
I'm okay.

476
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:24,796
I broke a wine bottle by mistake,

477
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:27,501
and Hong Nan Hee went home.

478
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:28,731
Mom.

479
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:33,142
I taught her that it is against courtesy to be an unwelcome guest.

480
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,382
Today's gathering was for Ji Yi.

481
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,741
It wasn't just to see her in person.

482
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,281
If you'd known, you shouldn't have done this.

483
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:44,082
You were so reckless, especially to your elders.

484
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,573
Is this what I've taught you?

485
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,601
Is this the kind of person my son is?

486
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,592
Did I let you down?

487
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:55,592
Yes, I'm very disappointed in you.

488
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,402
But it's about my marriage.

489
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:00,166
It's about my wife.

490
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,317
Kang Baek,

491
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:06,282
are you even aware of what you're saying?

492
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:08,312
You'll marry her?

493
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:09,748
Yes.

494
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:13,451
What are you saying?

495
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:16,382
Kang Baek, this is enough for today.

496
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,451
Right, I think we better stop here.

497
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,380
Wait, I didn't realize you were here.

498
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,551
I couldn't even hear you breathe.

499
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,531
Honey, go back to the room.

500
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,332
I want to have the lamp chop.

501
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:31,768
What should I do not to let you down?

502
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:40,312
I did my very best, but I ended up disappointing you.

503
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:43,342
I gave all my might to fit in,

504
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:46,682
and now must I do what you want even with my marriage?

505
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:50,344
Father, you know how much I tried!

506
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,495
Yes, I do.

507
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,964
What are you talking about?

508
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,726
Kang Baek...

509
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,191
didn't want to go to law school.

510
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,802
What on earth is this about?

511
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:10,572
You must go to law school to become a lawyer.

512
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,911
I didn't want to be a lawyer.

513
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,441
No one asked me about my dream.

514
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,981
All of you said I had to become a lawyer.

515
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,782
That it was only natural!

516
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,911
Why are you telling us this now?

517
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:25,136
No, you never asked me even once.

518
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:27,791
But he told you about this, honey?

519
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:31,791
He consulted with me in case he'd let you down.

520
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,802
Even so, you should've told me!

521
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:38,561
I didn't want to disappoint you like this.

522
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:41,771
It's different. It's different from now!

523
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,501
You can't compare it

524
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,001
- to bringing Hong Nan Hee here! 
 - It's not different.

525
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,672
Both of them concern my life!

526
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,112
I wanted to be a writer, not a lawyer.

527
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,342
I wanted to write poems and novels!

528
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:53,981
What?

529
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,881
Kang Baek.

530
00:33:56,822 --> 00:33:58,222
See?

531
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:00,255
You're disappointed.

532
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,772
All of you are disappointed,

533
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:05,862
so I gave up not to let you down.

534
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,901
I did the best I could!

535
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,781
But I can't let you do what you want with my marriage.

536
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,726
No.

537
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,469
I'll marry her.

538
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:36,823
It doesn't have to be Ji Yi,

539
00:34:36,823 --> 00:34:40,401
but not Hong Nan Hee.

540
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,131
Why not?

541
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:44,676
Why not her?

542
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:50,575
She's classless.

543
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,858
I'm really sorry,

544
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,718
but you just let me down.

545
00:34:58,612 --> 00:35:00,360
Kang Baek.

546
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,907
- Kang Baek! 
 - Hye Ryul!

547
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,152
Am I the only one who finds it strange?

548
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:08,552
She's brave and meticulous.

549
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:11,822
She seems much better than Ji Yi to be Kang Baek's wife.

550
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:15,185
She's charming too. Don't you agree?

551
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:19,676
- Mother. 
 - And I don't get it.

552
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:22,302
Hye Ryul, shouldn't you be able to understand his situation

553
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,989
more than anyone else here?

554
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:30,211
You married Professor Na despite the whole family's objection,

555
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,931
only for love.

556
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:35,660
My wife was adamant about it.

557
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,922
She even said she'd rather cut ties with her dear Hye Ryul

558
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:41,945
than letting Professor Na in this house.

559
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:45,862
Like mother, like son.

560
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:46,932
Father!

561
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:49,661
What? Aren't you happy in your marriage?

562
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:52,762
Then you should root for Kang Baek's happiness.

563
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:55,649
I was against that punk too,

564
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:58,089
but you didn't listen to me!

565
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,811
Grill lamb chops with sour marinade and mint,

566
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:04,071
and bring the dish to my study!

567
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:09,245
I don't need this darn napkin. It's a hassle.

568
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:12,658
Honey,

569
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:15,722
this air might cause me to have indigestion with whatever I eat.

570
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:17,092
Right.

571
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,222
You said you had an upset stomach.

572
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:23,249
- Should we eat alone in the room? 
 - Let's do that.

573
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:26,432
I'll make sure the food is well-prepared.

574
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:28,315
Thanks.

575
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,520
Kang Ye.

576
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,865
Sure, I'll leave you to talk.

577
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,966
You see,

578
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:49,661
Kang Baek loved writing ever since he was little,

579
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:52,097
although no one cared.

580
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:55,097
He gave up on it for you, Mom.

581
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:05,289
Leave Kang Baek alone for now.

582
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,036
I'm telling you not to add fuel

583
00:37:08,036 --> 00:37:11,210
to his temporary emotions.

584
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,691
I should've realized this much sooner.

585
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:22,398
Now I'm suffering from the worst regret ever.

586
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,091
If only I hadn't tried to stop you,

587
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:28,991
I wouldn't have ended up letting him into our family.

588
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,660
Mom.

589
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:34,827
Ms. Yang!

590
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:39,349
Hurry up with the main dish! We must send it to the annex!

591
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:50,625
Don't take what my mom said to heart.

592
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:55,015
- Look. 
 - I beg you.

593
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:56,747
Today,

594
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,271
let's not say anything.

595
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,082
Please.

596
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:07,673
If you truly care for me,

597
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:09,038
please.

598
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,561
It's been a long time.

599
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:35,426
A petty offender transformed into a big shot.

600
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,202
A rich criminal is different indeed.

601
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:40,032
He looks better than us.

602
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,871
Lowly scumbag.

603
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:44,172
His face looks so clean and sleek.

604
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:46,472
I need to manage my skin condition.

605
00:38:46,472 --> 00:38:50,352
A man only looks awful if he doesn't manage himself as he ages.

606
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:53,341
You're single, aren't you?

607
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:55,866
Geez.

608
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:01,222
It's good to see you after a long time, but what brought you here?

609
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,092
Sorry there's nothing I can do to help.

610
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,422
Don't be upsetting.

611
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:08,974
Come on and help us, rather aggressively.

612
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:11,270
Talk to me with respect.

613
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:16,600
You're not showing me respect, and this boy is being rude to me too.

614
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,271
You're driving me crazy.

615
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:22,112
You lowlife, do you think you're something

616
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,632
because people call you Mr. Chairman?

617
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:36,492
People call me "Mr. Chairman" for a good reason.

618
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:37,722
You're too tactless.

619
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,110
That's why your life hasn't gotten any better.

620
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:50,622
You've got dandruff on your shoulder.

621
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,911
I'm busy.

622
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:57,091
My all-day interview with the lawyer starts in 10 minutes.

623
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:01,060
And you,

624
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,061
you got on my bad side.

625
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:04,929
Like I care.

626
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,122
   

627
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,161
That was stiff.

628
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,601
What makes that jerk so full of himself?

629
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,202
He's the same lowlife.

630
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:25,672
A lowlife never changes.

631
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:30,911
What matters is, that piece of trash attracted so many roaches,

632
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,376
and he's acting so fearless

633
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:36,431
because someone has got his back.

634
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:42,805
Just what can he do from here?

635
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:00,947
My gosh, you're already here.

636
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:03,811
Beautiful weather, isn't it?

637
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:06,916
The weather is great today.

638
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,096
Have you been keeping cool?

639
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:12,580
Well, the thing is...

640
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:19,282
It still remains vacant.

641
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,462
You really think so?

642
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:26,461
Well, I was surprised because he brought her home.

643
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:29,501
He called her his girlfriend and said they were seriously dating.

644
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,601
Who knew Kang Baek would do such a gutsy thing?

645
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,441
What do you mean?

646
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:35,841
You didn't know?

647
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,382
We told him to bring you home, so we could see you

648
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:41,182
and talk to you guys about your wedding,

649
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:45,621
but he brought... Nan Hee? Was her name Nan Hee?

650
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,421
He brought her home.

651
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:55,299
My gosh. I guess you had no idea.

652
00:41:57,961 --> 00:42:00,972
Did he bring Hong Nan Hee home?

653
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:02,744
Yes.

654
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:04,641
We prepared a feast for you.

655
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:08,342
The entire family gathered together and waited, only to be shocked.

656
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:11,590
It was a whole new ball game.

657
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,577
That makes no sense.

658
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:22,869
Wow, it gave me goosebumps.

659
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,991
What do you mean by that?

660
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:27,033
She dazzled me.

661
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:29,206
Sorry, I don't follow.

662
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:30,961
Who do you stand with?

663
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:33,501
Nan Hee is quite charming.

664
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:36,532
Now, I understand why they've all fallen for her.

665
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:38,836
"They?"

666
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:42,316
Yes, that's right.

667
00:42:42,316 --> 00:42:45,481
I wasn't the only one who fell for her charms.

668
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:51,870
My step-grandmother, who is the real power behind the throne, and...

669
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,292
Et cetera.

670
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:56,251
Looks like you need to step up your game.

671
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,236
Help me,

672
00:42:58,236 --> 00:42:59,905
please.

673
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:04,879
Kang Baek is the only one for me.

674
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:10,612
Don't be depressed. I'll be on your side.

675
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:12,773
Do I have your word?

676
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:17,999
Well, everything has strings attached though.

677
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:20,081
I'll come straight to the point.

678
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,905
I am going to marry him.

679
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:25,576
No matter the cost.

680
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:29,056
Sounds like a deal.

681
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:40,010
Dad,

682
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:45,232
it's fine if he doesn't choose me, but it can't be her.

683
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:48,894
- Hello? 
 - Do everything you can to stop the investigation on Jusung.

684
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:50,922
You can't even do that, Dad?

685
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:53,582
Well, I understand,

686
00:43:53,582 --> 00:43:56,282
 but what's wrong, my princess? 

687
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:58,088
And...

688
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:01,661
hire a professor as my tutor.

689
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:04,555
I will not let that girl beat me.

690
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:07,522
Are you really all right?

691
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm really sorry.

692
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:11,873
It's fine.

693
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:14,302
Are you okay?

694
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:16,417
I expected no less.

695
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:17,972
Are you really okay?

696
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,941
Yes, it's really fine.

697
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:24,081
I tell it like it is. You know that about me, don't you?

698
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:27,293
It was like Romeo and Juliet,

699
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:29,482
or like Pyramus and Thisbe.

700
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:32,822
I felt like I was a tragic heroine or a myth's protagonist.

701
00:44:32,822 --> 00:44:35,202
It was kind of fun.

702
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:38,822
"Oh, my poor love, Thisbe.

703
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:41,891
You died because of me, yet I stand here alive.

704
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:44,761
I shall thrust this dagger into my sinful heart

705
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:46,626
and follow you in death.

706
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:48,702
The lion behind the rock. Come out

707
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:51,141
and chew up this sinful flesh.

708
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:54,762
This veil shall soak up my blood!"

709
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,311
No wonder you're in the drama club.

710
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:02,211
- I'm good, right? 
 - Yes.

711
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:04,782
- Try it. 
 - Gosh, I can't.

712
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:07,222
- Come on. Do it! 
 - I can't.

713
00:45:07,222 --> 00:45:11,105
"You died because of me, yet I stand here alive, Thisbe."

714
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,217
Come on!

715
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:18,368
"You died because of me, yet I stand here alive,

716
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,302
Thisbe."

717
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:24,232
"This dagger...

718
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:25,702
With this dagger..."

719
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:27,441
"I shall thrust this dagger into my sinful heart

720
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:28,872
and follow you in death."

721
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:30,641
"I shall thrust this dagger into my sinful heart

722
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:33,310
and follow you in death."

723
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,153
"Thisbe!"

724
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:39,121
Bravo!

725
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:41,691
- That was great! 
 - You're here.

726
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:43,291
Nice, sandwiches!

727
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,891
Hey, finish what you were doing.

728
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,492
Oh, is he a rookie actor?

729
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,061
He has got a nice face.

730
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:51,561
Stop making fun of me.

731
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:52,990
Oh, you're here.

732
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,680
Hi.

733
00:46:01,612 --> 00:46:05,775
All right. Everyone is here, so let's get started.

734
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:12,370
Oh, sorry.

735
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,482
   

736
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,761
I'm really sorry.

737
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:33,147
 Why aren't you picking up? Let's meet up and talk. 

738
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:41,682
I want to win first place and the excellence award too.

739
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:45,051
I'll be straightforward with you.

740
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,788
Help me.

741
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:52,355
I told you from the get-go that I'll help you out.

742
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:55,391
Didn't you say you were too busy and couldn't make time?

743
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:57,431
I had a change of heart.

744
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:00,522
I'll do it properly.

745
00:47:00,522 --> 00:47:03,601
Whatever it is, I'll beat Hong Nan Hee.

746
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,615
 "Written Oath." 

747
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:12,612
 "I will conduct research and prepare my statement of defense 

748
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:18,305
 on my own, without the help of anyone." 

749
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,661
   

750
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:26,661
 "I pledge that I will not contact an outsider 

751
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:29,837
 or seek help from anyone." 

752
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:41,739
   

753
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,935
So? Is the food ready?

754
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:54,991
Yes, everything you asked for.

755
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:56,992
Meat, seafood, Korean food, and Western dishes too.

756
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,021
Everything from healthy dishes to fried chicken.

757
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:03,492
Darn it. I can't believe I have to prepare a feast for a convict.

758
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:05,862
Am I under some kind of spell or something?

759
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:07,972
Why did we get intel from that scumbag, of all people?

760
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:11,842
We just let our guard down, thinking the knife was in our hands.

761
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:14,672
Dropping bombs is their specialty, but we had no idea.

762
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:17,612
Why couldn't you figure it out sooner if you're that smart?

763
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:19,981
Strictly speaking, this is all your fault!

764
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,682
You were the one who put me in touch with that nutjob, you idiot!

765
00:48:23,682 --> 00:48:24,922
Hey, get your facts straight.

766
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:28,178
You asked me to get in touch with him!

767
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:34,532
As for booze, give him Kaoliang liquor.

768
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:36,504
First,

769
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:38,908
get him drunk.

770
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:41,202
Then either squeeze something big out of him,

771
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:43,702
so we can turn the tables,

772
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:47,491
or get him to promise us that he won't mess with us.

773
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,892
Settle it, once and for all.

774
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:54,334
Chairman Ji, dig in.

775
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:56,512
It's a humble spread, but we ordered a few dishes for you.

776
00:48:56,512 --> 00:49:00,184
Take your time. Have your drink too.

777
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:07,758
Chairman Ji, you like Kaoliang liquor.

778
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,291
Here, have some.

779
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,862
Kaoliang liquor pairs very well with Chinese food,

780
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:15,310
especially with stir-fried seafood.

781
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,902
Mr. Ko, you should have some too.

782
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,921
Pour me some as well.

783
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:23,172
Come on, let's drink. Here's to Kaoliang liquor.

784
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,519
Cheers.

785
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:33,422
I've been living on nothing but beans and rice.

786
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,852
I'll get an upset stomach if I suddenly eat greasy food.

787
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,676
My intestines will go into shock.

788
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:43,332
You've eaten nothing but beans and rice, but you still look great.

789
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:47,615
You still look healthy and strong, Chairman Ji.

790
00:49:47,615 --> 00:49:51,611
Are you saying that I'm cut out to live in jail?

791
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,111
Well...

792
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:59,065
Don't twist my words, please.

793
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:02,751
Thank you for your cooperation.

794
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,452
Continue to help us out.

795
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:05,782
"Cooperation?"

796
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:07,622
Who? Me?

797
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,822
I should cooperate?

798
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:11,675
Why should I?

799
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:17,280
Well... How should I put this?

800
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:23,430
You know, the big shot in the opposition party...

801
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,135
Did I blow the whistle on a politician in the opposition party?

802
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:30,305
Who says that?

803
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:32,691
I know nothing about it.

804
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:35,062
Big shot, my foot.

805
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,722
I just blew the whistle on some despicable scumbags,

806
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:42,242
who took my money and acted like it never happened.

807
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:47,582
I don't care if they're cops or darned prosecutors.

808
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:59,675
Oh, I see.

809
00:50:59,675 --> 00:51:03,109
I guess you haven't received the list yet.

810
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:06,182
It's not even a quarter of the full list I have.

811
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:08,182
So...

812
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:13,710
small fries like you guys shouldn't mess with me.

813
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:18,332
The food is stinking up the room. Put these away.

814
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:32,122
Chairman Ji—

815
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:39,656
You see, you're smart.

816
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:41,251
I'm useful,

817
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:43,627
and I'm easy to control. Why?

818
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:45,584
I'm simple,

819
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:48,546
but why aren't you taking advantage of me?

820
00:51:53,422 --> 00:51:56,330
What are you afraid of?

821
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:03,472
Prosecutors were born rich and only memorized textbooks.

822
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:05,572
They know nothing about the world.

823
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:09,211
I'm worried about how you'll survive in this world

824
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,935
without your title.

825
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:14,981
- Geez. 
 - That's darn right.

826
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:19,981
A lowly ex-convict is worried about you.

827
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:22,414
You're helpless.

828
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:25,576
You nerds have nothing but knowledge.

829
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:33,015
The answer to life doesn't come from what you memorized.

830
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,980
My goodness!

831
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:47,041
What are you doing?

832
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,974
What is this mess?

833
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:18,081
Haven't you seen someone eating before?

834
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:22,005
You think an ex-convict eats in a different way?

835
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:27,521
Why were you startled? You cowards.

836
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:35,165
That tastes awful.

837
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:38,688
Hey, Mr. Ko,

838
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:40,672
if you kill her,

839
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:45,072
I'll give you something big enough to shake this country big time,

840
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:46,692
okay?

841
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:55,449
You darn wench!

842
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:03,093
Don't you dare mess with me again.

843
00:54:03,093 --> 00:54:05,356
I dare you.

844
00:54:05,356 --> 00:54:08,942
I dare you, darn wench.

845
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:25,047
What should I do about him?

846
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:28,476
Why are you so angry?

847
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,582
Aren't you upset?

848
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:34,050
An ex-convict is threatening a prosecutor.

849
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,325
Let's make this clear.

850
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:39,091
He didn't say he'd kill me himself.

851
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,961
He asked Mr. Ko to kill me.

852
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:44,802
That's an instigation

853
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:46,731
and insult.

854
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:51,312
I'm not sure if that'll be considered public.

855
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:53,221
Ms. Han,

856
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,474
do you think this is funny?

857
00:54:56,474 --> 00:55:00,552
Who do you think is the most humiliated in this building?

858
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:01,981
Me?

859
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:07,166
No, it's Mr. Jang and Mr. Ko.

860
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:12,661
They'd rather get caught pooping on the street.

861
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:16,132
Dropping by Mr. Jang's office was beneficial to us.

862
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:19,312
It's nothing to get angry about. You should be happy.

863
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:22,346
Still, that Dolphin punk...

864
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:36,966
Hello. Han Hye Ryul speaking.

865
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:40,266
Yes.

866
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:43,057
Yes.

867
00:55:43,057 --> 00:55:45,580
I'll see you there.

868
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:52,055
One. Two.

869
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:54,830
Three. Four.

870
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,871
One, two, three, four.

871
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,672
One, two, three, four.

872
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:01,112
Be careful!

873
00:56:01,112 --> 00:56:02,684
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

874
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:05,329
One, two, three, four!

875
00:56:07,012 --> 00:56:09,895
One, two, three, four.

876
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:13,010
One. Two.

877
00:56:17,492 --> 00:56:20,435
May I ask for one?

878
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:23,742
You must return the last one with one pack.

879
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:29,465
That's excessive profit. Isn't that illegal?

880
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:33,260
That sounds like a seriously unfair legal act.

881
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,611
You must've studied law,

882
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:37,041
but you know what?

883
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,881
Civil Law Article 1 says, "If no provisions exist in acts,

884
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,205
customary law shall apply."

885
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:46,610
However, sometimes customary law is stronger than acts.

886
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:51,724
That's the case for this last cigarette.

887
00:56:51,724 --> 00:56:55,885
I'll be too scared to smoke it.

888
00:56:55,885 --> 00:57:02,375
Still, the highlight of spy movies is the smoke during the operation.

889
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,786
I'm still going to smoke it even if you rip me off.

890
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:10,041
You had to act like you are in a spy movie because you got someone on you.

891
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:12,811
Why did someone great like you want to see me?

892
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:19,680
When I heard someone was on me, I realized

893
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,291
they finally recognized me.

894
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:23,791
The Intelligence Service is doing its job right.

895
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:26,991
I became a little full of myself.

896
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:28,432
Congratulations.

897
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:30,492
Let me tell you something discouraging.

898
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:35,532
Soon, you'll realize it's not a big deal.

899
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,032
You're so condescending.

900
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:42,211
- Isn't it amazing? 
 - Yes, I approve.

901
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:45,836
Sorry to say this when you approve of me,

902
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:49,282
but I don't trust you,

903
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:53,202
so meeting up with you like this is somewhat disconcerting.

904
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:56,377
Yet, you're here.

905
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,859
That's good enough for me.

906
00:57:59,592 --> 00:58:05,096
It's very rare for the press to unite and impose an embargo.

907
00:58:05,096 --> 00:58:08,562
They double-check and cross-check on each other.

908
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:11,040
It's chaos.

909
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,972
Dolphin is determined to mess it up.

910
00:58:14,972 --> 00:58:17,676
That's how influential it is,

911
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:20,282
and a false report is crucial,

912
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:30,986
but I have more than that.

913
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:35,551
You should know.

914
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:37,739
Why is that?

915
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:42,516
Their goal is you.

916
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:59,505
 What we've achieved, what we share, and what we plan. 

917
00:58:59,505 --> 00:59:01,921
 All of that is impossible with you. 

918
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:07,578
 I mean, if I let you have Na Geun Woo, would you be able to handle him? 

919
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,626
 I won't say anything to my husband. 

920
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:16,819
 You can't change anything anyway. 

921
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:54,074
 Kang Baek, 

922
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,911
 I've thought about it. 

923
00:59:56,911 --> 01:00:02,103
 Let's... get married. 

924
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:11,070



925
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:16,500
    
♫  Tell me  ♫

926
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:21,990
♫  It's okay for any reason  ♫

927
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:35,620
♫  Did someone cover my eyes  ♫

928
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:49,820
♫  Tell me why I'm your tag  ♫

929
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,770
♫  Even if I shake my hand and hold it  ♫

930
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,302
 Wish your son happiness as his father. 

931
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,401
 I have something to say. 

932
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:02,512
 Are you going to tell me that you were seeing someone? 

933
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:05,341
 I'll move out and live with Nan Hee first. 

934
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,412
 That jerk? He's crazy. 

935
01:01:07,412 --> 01:01:08,952
 we must play him at his own game. 

936
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:11,291
 Give him Han Hye Ryul. 

937
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,251
 Let's take advantage of Dolphin. 

938
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,652
 - You should put yourself first. 
 - Let's get married. 

939
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:16,791
   

940
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,475
 Kang Baek is in the shower, Mother. 

941
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,191
 What are you doing? 

942
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:23,776
 Kang Baek's is not going home tonight. 

943
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:26,940
 - I won't let him. 
 - Put Kang Baek on the phone now! 

944
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:31,150
♫  Standing in front of me  ♫
