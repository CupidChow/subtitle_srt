1
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:06,717
Let's break up.

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,229
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:17,842
What?

4
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:21,128
What did you just say? Say that again.

5
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,028
What did you just say?

6
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:25,467
Nan Hee, the thing is—

7
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,667
You're sorry?

8
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,358
For what?

9
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,778
For toying with me?

10
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:33,837
Because you have to toss me now that you're done with me?

11
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:36,178
You want to break up?

12
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,782
Did we make our relationship official?

13
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,066
What is our relationship?

14
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,818
Did you think I would sleep with you whenever you wanted

15
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:46,218
and let you abandon me when you didn't want me anymore?

16
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:55,427
You said you were at ease when you were with me.

17
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:58,940
You said being with me comforted you

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,338
and made your heart flutter!

19
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:05,746
You said that's why you loved me! You said you loved me!

20
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:09,667
You said you loved me,

21
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,700
but you want to break up with me now

22
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,274
out of the blue

23
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,901
like this?

24
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:21,777
I'm really sorry.

25
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,427
No. You have no idea.

26
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:30,348
You have no idea what you should be apologizing for.

27
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:31,667
There's no sense of respect

28
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:34,338
in the way you treat me or other people.

29
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,408
You only ramble on and on about being fair, bringing justice,

30
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,337
and having a conscience in front of people,

31
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:41,877
but you have no clue what it means to respect other people.

32
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,748
So you're worried that your wife might find out about us

33
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:49,017
because people will find out that you're nothing but a hypocrite!

34
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:50,917
So you're so afraid that you'll lose what you have,

35
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:54,417
which you didn't even deserve in the first place!

36
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,968
You're so consumed with the thought of getting rid of me

37
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:04,963
that you don't even see what you're doing to me.

38
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,778
You were having fun when you were sleeping with me.

39
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,098
I bet it was a thrill.

40
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,878
I'm not asking you to pay for your pleasure.

41
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:18,617
I'm saying you must at least show respect

42
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:20,647
to the woman who made you laugh and comforted you.

43
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,532
So,

44
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,607
since you didn't show me any respect,

45
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:31,059
I will show you the disastrous result

46
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,217
of your action from now on.

47
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:41,778
I bet you want to kill me.

48
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,167
You want me to die, don't you?

49
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,237
How can you say something like that?

50
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,242
Not yet?

51
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:53,679
Then I'll make you think just like that.

52
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,682
Nan Hee, where are you going?

53
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,518
Nan Hee!

54
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:02,086
Nan Hee! It's dangerous!

55
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:06,200
When have you ever worried about me?

56
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:11,342
I'm going to die!

57
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,652
If I die,

58
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,100
you will feel a sense of guilt, even if it's small.

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,688
I will break your heart!

60
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,078
Nan Hee.

61
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,678
Then...

62
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:29,301
you will realize what you have done to me.

63
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,818
- I'm sorry. It's my fault. 
 - Let go of me!

64
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:35,985
- I'm sorry. It's my fault. 
 - Let go!

65
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:05,030



66
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,428
   

67
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,027
What happened?

68
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:19,920
I texted you, but you never texted back. I got worried.

69
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:24,542
Sorry, I didn't check your text.

70
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,948
I'll go wash up.

71
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:31,648
Nan Hee,

72
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:37,632
did you cry?

73
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,977
You met Na Geun Woo, right?

74
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,914
Did something happen?

75
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,947
He wanted to break up.

76
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:52,218
That's for the better.

77
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:56,068
You shouldn't even cry about that. This was supposed to happen.

78
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,275
I told him no.

79
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,786
What?

80
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,207
I can't break up with him.

81
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:04,948
- Nan Hee. 
 - I can't.

82
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:08,528
I can't break up with him yet. I still have so much to do.

83
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,932
You should end it here.

84
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:15,227
What if you get hurt from this? This would've been all for nothing.

85
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,427
You should stop here. I'm sure you can find other ways.

86
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:19,164
No.

87
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:20,964
There is none.

88
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:24,198
I tried out everything else I could, but nothing worked.

89
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,437
I finally started to get on their nerves.

90
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:29,437
How can I stop now? I can't give up now.

91
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:33,668
I would've never started in the first place,

92
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,097
if I was afraid of getting hurt.

93
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:43,138
I should bet my life to give them a taste of their own medicine.

94
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,493
Nan Hee.

95
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,486
Let me go and wash up.

96
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,268
The key point of the Jusung investigation is

97
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,108
to prove the illegal activities conducted

98
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:07,131
during the merger and acquisition at Jusung.

99
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,048
First, Jusung's subsidiary, Jusung Chemical,

100
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:13,547
changed the protocol for accounting management around the end of 2017,

101
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,418
so they inflated the company's value.

102
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,217
That's fraudulent accounting,

103
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,818
so it violates the Capital Markets Act.

104
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,528
While passing down the management rights

105
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,988
and strengthening their authority,

106
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:25,248
we must find out how many illegal—

107
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,581
What do you think you're doing?

108
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,307
We're in the middle of a meeting. If you need to talk to me,

109
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,904
I'll go to your office, sir.

110
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:45,547
So you do know that you report to me, right?

111
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,924
Sit down. Sit down.

112
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,079
I told you to sit down!

113
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:57,897
I'll finish the meeting soon and be upstairs.

114
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,657
So you remember that I'm your supervisor,

115
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:02,398
but did you forget what I told you about this investigation?

116
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,533
Don't finish the meeting soon.

117
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,677
I want you to finish the meeting at this very minute. Stop it!

118
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:11,328
I cannot do that.

119
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:18,548
Are you going to defy orders from your supervisor?

120
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,948
Article Seven of the Prosecutors' Office Act,

121
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,718
"Regarding the affairs at prosecution,

122
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:28,428
prosecutors must follow orders from their supervisors."

123
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:31,340
That's the regulation we have.

124
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,257
Are you his sidekick?

125
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,428
What?

126
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,398
The regulation in question was implemented to achieve unity

127
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,738
when exercising rights as prosecutors. It's only a supplementary regulation.

128
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:44,577
By setting up a nationally uniformed investigation network,

129
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,557
we can be efficient.

130
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:50,247
By balancing our rights to exercise our authority, we can maintain fairness.

131
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:54,017
Also, it is established to control arbitrary decisions by prosecutors.

132
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:57,747
Hence, Article Seven has nothing to do with the Jusung investigation,

133
00:07:57,747 --> 00:08:00,757
as it is clearly confirmed that they committed illegal activities,

134
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,558
and that cannot be and will not be applied

135
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,388
to prevent prosecutors from conducting

136
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:06,698
investigations independently.

137
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,698
If the regulation is used for that purpose,

138
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,468
it will be an abuse of authority.

139
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:15,371
It's considered a serious offense.

140
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:19,111
What? A serious offense?

141
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:23,247
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

142
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,568
Just another day at the office, right?

143
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,988
That's right.

144
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,509
Let's sit down.

145
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:52,024
All right. Where were we?

146
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,900
   

147
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:22,837
This year, we again came in second for the bar exam's pass rate.

148
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,878
Two years in a row.

149
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,808
I knew this would happen.

150
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,307
What are we going to do now?

151
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:32,518
It's imperative to secure our budget to recruit more professors

152
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,177
and expand our scholarship program.

153
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:37,247
How can we now ask for more funding after this?

154
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:38,588
Don't you agree?

155
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:41,157
The pass rate isn't everything.

156
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:44,027
I'm sure you know that our graduates have

157
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:46,257
stellar reputations at the courthouses,

158
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:49,028
prosecutors' offices, and law firms.

159
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,928
The pass rate isn't everything.

160
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,597
"The pass rate isn't everything?"

161
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,268
Then what are we doing here?

162
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,737
What is this place?

163
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:59,837
This is the law school where students learn about the law.

164
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,237
The students here invest their precious time

165
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:04,347
and work their heads off to pass the bar exam and practice law,

166
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,148
and they spend a lot of money to learn from us.

167
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,087
They must pass the bar exam to do anything as law officers!

168
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:12,257
There is only the next step when they pass the exam!

169
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:13,717
Ma'am,

170
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:16,827
this is what Professor Na here thinks,

171
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:20,158
so it doesn't matter how hard I try to help them pass the bar exam.

172
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:23,698
- Don't you agree? 
 - This isn't some cram school.

173
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,138
This is a graduate program.

174
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,138
This isn't some prep school.

175
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:30,568
Then, are you telling me I'm acting like an instructor at a prep school?

176
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,207
Do you think I'm some businessman? I'm a professor too!

177
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:36,077
My top priority is my students' needs!

178
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:37,408
I'm an educator!

179
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:39,717
As this is a graduate program at a law school,

180
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,548
we ought to teach our students

181
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,987
the academic side of the law, as well as the practicality of the law,

182
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,717
so we shape them to be more than just people who practice law.

183
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,029
I have a doctoral degree too!

184
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,658
Ma'am, I apologize for my outburst.

185
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,609
If this continues,

186
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,237
I can't hold my lectures here.

187
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,637
He's not even a tenured professor. He's just a showman.

188
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,768
He's influencing our school with his mere image.

189
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,548
I can no longer put up with this.

190
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,007
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,448
Professor Na,

192
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:15,117
do whatever you want. Let's see what happens.

193
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,388
Those kids from Seoul National University?

194
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,658
They do nothing but study for exams,

195
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,418
and the school is packed with kids

196
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,227
whose parents are judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.

197
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,487
That's a tight-knitted circle.

198
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,658
Your pathetic principle of idealism

199
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:29,826
is weakening the dominance of our school!

200
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:32,398
What good is it when our students become judges or prosecutors?

201
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:33,638
They won't be able to do a thing

202
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:35,607
because those kids from SNU will outnumber them.

203
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,278
So you'll take responsibility for that?

204
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,798
When you're planning to quit teaching and become a politician?

205
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:47,198
You know what? This is the only career I want for the rest of my life!

206
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:55,313
Professor Hwang,

207
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,756
I'm sure Professor Na

208
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:00,597
understood the message behind your passionate speech,

209
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:06,198
and I'm well-aware how hard you work for our school.

210
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,186
I'm always grateful.

211
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,408
Please excuse us.

212
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:11,908
I still have a few things to say to Professor Na.

213
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:15,678
Sure. I also have to work on the questions for the mock exams.

214
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:17,481
I'll get going then.

215
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,748
Reduce the number of your classes starting next semester.

216
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:25,658
Pardon?

217
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:29,087
Do you think this is a place for polishing your reputation?

218
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,457
You're only misleading them, so stop holding lectures.

219
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:34,666
- Mother— 
 - I'm not your mother.

220
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,768
Your trick only works on Hye Ryul

221
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,097
because she doesn't know any better,

222
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:38,438
but to fall for your idealistic principles,

223
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,878
how dare you think it would work on me?

224
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:43,908
People are praising you because they fell for your act.

225
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:45,908
Do you think you're an important professor?

226
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,968
Do you think you can go higher?

227
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,233
Know your place.

228
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,740
Don't be arrogant.

229
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:54,778
If we can't catch up with SNU's pass rate,

230
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,329
I'll get rid of your lectures.

231
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,198
- We need three people. 
 - Hey, this is nice.

232
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,898
There are only two of us.

233
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,768
- We're studying for this. 
 - Look at that.

234
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:12,107
Do you want to join us? 
    

235
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,837
- We just need one more person. 
 - Right. We just need one more person.

236
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,568
We just need an extra person.

237
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,007
- Let's ask one of our friends. 
 - Should we try it?

238
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,837
- You must be in the same lecture. 
 - Let's go this way.

239
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,778
All of my friends are preparing for it.

240
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:24,308
I'm going to try out for the contest.

241
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:27,418
You want to go for the contest on top of our study group and all?

242
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:30,162
I don't have time for it.

243
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,188
I don't think it's that necessary.

244
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,918
It sounds fun, so I'll try it out.

245
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,530
Same here.

246
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,117
Then I'll join you too.

247
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,197
You have to put aside at least two hours per day.

248
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:41,158
You guys have time for that, right?

249
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,198
On top of our study group and the bar exam lectures?

250
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,568
You want us to put aside two more hours a day?

251
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,698
A week before the contest, we'll do an all-nighter to prepare for it.

252
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:50,458
Kang Baek, Kyung Yoon, are you guys up for it?

253
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:54,948
What about you, Ji Yi?

254
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,690
We can only have up to four people on our team for this contest.

255
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,048
Why don't we do it together? I'll make more time for it.

256
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:06,117
I just need you to do some research.

257
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:08,457
Come to think of it, winning the award sounds pretty good.

258
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,127
There's a benefit, and I can put it down on my resumé.

259
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,798
That's if you win the award.

260
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,028
I'll think about it.

261
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,528
To be honest, I have enough on my plate.

262
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,538
Are you sure I don't have to put aside a lot of time?

263
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:21,908
Yes.

264
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,638
Kang Baek, can you help me out?

265
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,957
Why don't we do it with Hyun?

266
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,159
"Pacta sunt servanda." 
 (Latin) 

267
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,482
Promises must be kept.

268
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:37,101
Sorry.

269
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:41,793
What a model student!

270
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,658
This is why loyalty is important.

271
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:46,257
You were treading on thin ice just now.

272
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,698
I almost sued you for reliance damages.

273
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,497
I just dodged a bullet, then.

274
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:51,668
Too bad.

275
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:54,938
I will only profit when there's an argument.

276
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,808
What happens if you are dishonest like him?

277
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,577
It will be a violation of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

278
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:01,337
- He'll get arrested! 
 - Gosh.

279
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,091
Hey.

280
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:13,357
- You know, I was— 
 - Can't you see that we're studying here?

281
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:15,058
We booked this room and put up a sign on the door.

282
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:18,098
You can't just barge in here like this.

283
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:20,278
I know that.

284
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,851
- So... 
 - Is this urgent?

285
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,648
What? Yes.

286
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,808
You can say it's urgent, yes.

287
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,960
What's this about?

288
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,178
- Well, I was— 
 - We're busy.

289
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:38,077
Sort out what you want to say and send us a message later.

290
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:39,962
No!

291
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,332
Well...

292
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:47,757
I want to participate in the contest too.

293
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,087
Then do it.

294
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,888
Why are you telling us that?

295
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,428
We have already formed our teams.

296
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:55,168
You should go and ask other people.

297
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,008
We're in our study group now.

298
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:00,938
If you want, would you like to join us?

299
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:03,908
Kang Baek, Kyung Yoon, and I are going to be on the same team.

300
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,588
- Are you guys okay with that? 
 - Sure.

301
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:08,013
Sure.

302
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,242
Really?

303
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,817
Will you let me join you?

304
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,118
Let you join us? Gosh, we're all working together here.

305
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:18,918
It's going to be pretty tough. Are you sure you can handle it?

306
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,325
Yes, of course.

307
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,701
I'll do my best! Thank you.

308
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:28,598
Thank you. I really appreciate it, Nan Hee.

309
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,227
Gosh, don't mention it.

310
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,098
I'm sure you know more precedents than us.

311
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,838
We should be thanking you.

312
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,037
We're in the middle of our study group.

313
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,698
I'll call you later.

314
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,106
Okay.

315
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,663
I'll get going then.

316
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:50,215
I'll wait for you to call me.

317
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,983
The precedents...

318
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,421
Right.

319
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:59,587
It's not like I haven't done this before.

320
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:01,112
You know that, right?

321
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:05,775
Okay. I do know a lot of precedents.

322
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,827
What are you doing?

323
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,427
What do you mean?

324
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,818
Why did you drag him in?

325
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,864
You're not on our team.

326
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,717
Besides, why would you put it like that?

327
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:22,188
Drag him in? He's a student here as much as we are.

328
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:25,719
What? He scares me!

329
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,441
Everyone here knows he's weird.

330
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,727
He has been studying for the bar exam for ten years

331
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,257
and was held back because his grades were so low.

332
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:32,398
He has no friends.

333
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,368
He gives creepy Post-Its to people in the study hall.

334
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,928
Everyone knows that he's a little crazy.

335
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:41,098
Why would you let him get close to us?

336
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:44,370
And what about you? What was that?

337
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,078
How can you let him join you? What are you thinking?

338
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:53,148
So in your opinion, this investigation was far-fetched to begin with?

339
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,848
That's right. It's more than just far-fetched.

340
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,618
Actually, everything is only suspicion so far.

341
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,257
They already came to the conclusion that Jusung probably did

342
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:04,128
something illegal to pass down the management rights,

343
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,227
and they came up with some speculation to suit that.

344
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:07,928
"Wouldn't they have done this?"

345
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:09,398
They are just trying to corner Jusung.

346
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,728
So this is a typical example of a target investigation

347
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:15,168
which is always discussed as a problem for prosecution reform.

348
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:18,578
Let me tell you the biggest risk of conducting such investigations.

349
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:21,777
If they can't find clear evidence during this target investigation,

350
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,178
they are compelled to look for even a speck of dust.

351
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:27,148
So what do they do? They start investigating beyond the limit.

352
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,317
This is another problem the reform is addressing.

353
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,317
Technicalities-driven investigation.

354
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:32,618
They look for the smallest speck of dust,

355
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,158
so their target is overwhelmed.

356
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,888
Their goal is to catch their target on a technicality.

357
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:39,057
They investigate their cousins, distant cousins, and their in-laws!

358
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:42,797
So are you implying that they are investigating everyone,

359
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:47,067
so they can go after the Christmas Fund case?

360
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,138
- I don't agree. 
 - Excuse me.

361
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,878
I'm not done yet.

362
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,277
Right. That's it.

363
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:54,807
Why is that brought up here?

364
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,807
I thought Jusung was the problem.

365
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,178
Then investigate Jusung.

366
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,678
Why are they going after the Blue House?

367
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:03,987
It's already against the law to go after a specific target.

368
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:07,688
It's clear what the agenda of this investigation is.

369
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,987
They are plotting something

370
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:12,358
by conducting a far-fetched and irrational investigation.

371
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,527
They have already lost their loyalty to the law.

372
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,567
So you are saying that this is only a show to satisfy the ambition

373
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,868
of Ms. Han Hye Ryul and Mr. Na Geun Woo.

374
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,567
 In other words, this is a politically calculated move. 

375
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:27,059
 I wonder if they won't be facing any risks by doing so. 

376
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,802
 I believe our public's wise judgment will be... their risk... 

377
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:46,658
   

378
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:49,165
 I need you to hurry. 

379
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,161
   

380
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,977
 When will it be done? 

381
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:07,517
I don't think you should be taking your sweet time now.

382
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:11,357
This is my wrongdoing.

383
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,551
I will take full responsibility.

384
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,448
- But we can't stop— 
 -  Oh .

385
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:21,272
This is why you are a problem.

386
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:24,570
Look, Mr. Na,

387
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,838
do you actually think you can take responsibility for it?

388
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:32,507
 Han Hye Ryul's incredibly high pride and the life of this young student. 

389
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:35,608
How are you going to take responsibility?

390
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,288
 Han Hye Ryul will feel humiliated to death, 

391
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:42,571
and this will just kill that student.

392
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:46,239
Now tell me how you will take responsibility!

393
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:56,960
   

394
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,340
Hi, honey.

395
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,098
Yes.

396
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:05,171
If it's not urgent, can I call you later?

397
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,178
Yes, important guests are here to visit me.

398
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:10,082
Sorry, bye.

399
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:14,017
Welcome.

400
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,928
Please have some tea.

401
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,939
I'm sorry we couldn't catch them this time.

402
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:44,678
- We could have. 
 - Don't mention it.

403
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,677
We miss our suspects every time. Right, Mr. Oh?

404
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:50,488
Of course. We hardly catch our suspects.

405
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:52,660
What?

406
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,902
That's classified.

407
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:59,457
You look cooler in person.

408
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:02,967
Oh, my. Do I look that bad on TV?

409
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,128
No, that's not what I meant.

410
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:08,467
Hey, you punk. This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

411
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:12,008
Then, Mr. Ji, I guess you were quite the player.

412
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:16,548
Well, yes. I was very popular among women.

413
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,584
Look at you.

414
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,418
What, you punk?

415
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,895
Well, thank you.

416
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:30,088
I know you're disappointed, but being considerate of us, instead.

417
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:33,728
It's all right. We share the same goal.

418
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,003
Christmas Fund.

419
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:37,528
We must bring them down.

420
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:40,368
Yes, no one is willing to get involved,

421
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:44,952
so your support is giving us great strength,

422
00:22:44,952 --> 00:22:49,177
but you'll have to be careful.

423
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:53,677
Dolphin is no human.

424
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:57,791
You must be very careful.

425
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,677
There are people behind this mirror, right?

426
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:12,859
But what is this place?

427
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,268
I don't feel like eating here.

428
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,471
The table is too dark,

429
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,547
and geez, it's dusty.

430
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:28,018
From now on, we will begin recording our interrogation

431
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:31,718
on Ji Joon Ki, the suspect in the Christmas Fund case.

432
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:34,777
No, wait.

433
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:38,627
You will record what?

434
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:42,268
I'm informing you that we will video-record this interrogation

435
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:43,897
according to the Criminal Procedure Code.

436
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,768
The whole process will be filmed from start to end.

437
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:49,467
As soon as the recording is over, the original copy will be sealed.

438
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,628
I see, the Criminal Procedure Code.

439
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:55,764
That's nice, the Criminal Procedure Code,

440
00:23:55,764 --> 00:24:00,842
but does the Korean prosecution even know of such a law?

441
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:05,998
You guys don't seem to care much about procedures.

442
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:10,335
Then,

443
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:14,895
let me perform my right to be assisted by an attorney,

444
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:18,598
that I am given by the Constitution and the Criminal Procedure Code,

445
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:20,898
as prescribed by Article 12, Fourth Section of the Constitution,

446
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:25,265
and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

447
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:31,130
I'm quite experienced in these kinds of issues, you see.

448
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,047
Are you stunned?

449
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:40,197
All right, I refuse to be interrogated

450
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:43,735
without my attorney's presence.

451
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:50,598
When we notified you of the summoning date,

452
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:52,698
you were asked whether you want your attorney's presence,

453
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:54,498
and you answered you didn't need that.

454
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:59,007
Well, I didn't think I'd need my attorney

455
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:01,907
for eating stir-fried meatballs here.

456
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:06,818
So are you refusing to be interrogated today?

457
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:07,877
Yes.

458
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:10,418
Then when should we reschedule to?

459
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:14,601
I'm not sure. When would it be okay for you?

460
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,317
I'm sure you want to hear a lot from me.

461
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,570
Right, Ms. Han?

462
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:27,668
You see,

463
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:31,455
I've been wanting to meet you

464
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:33,757
because I thought

465
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:39,510
you and I would click.

466
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:43,147
How dare you, darn swindler?

467
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:46,757
Hey, you scum. I'm not your friend!

468
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,557
You filthy moron!

469
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:52,998
When a prosecutor asks a question, you just give an answer!

470
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:56,998
How dare you try to talk with me, you ignorant lowlife?

471
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:59,553
Darn.

472
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,993
   

473
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:10,907
Tell them we need to check on something with him, and put him in the waiting room.

474
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:13,118
Make sure he comes to his senses.

475
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:15,118
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,684
Look here!

477
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,718
Hey!

478
00:26:57,628 --> 00:26:59,864
What is it?

479
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:02,268
Why aren't you sending me back to the lock-up?

480
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:04,228
It's so suffocating here.

481
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:08,752
I came here at 2:30 p.m., and 5 p.m. passed a while ago!

482
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,967
The prosecutor wants you to wait here to check something.

483
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,312
Check what?

484
00:27:15,037 --> 00:27:17,446
Where are the honorifics?

485
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:23,088
Sir, check what?

486
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:25,883
Why do you ask me?

487
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:31,235
We're just doing what the prosecutor told us to do.

488
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:34,927
Hey, why do you talk to me without honorifics?

489
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:37,148
Why, you idiot...

490
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,972
You dropped honorifics first.

491
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,510
"Hey?"

492
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,343
"Hey..."

493
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:48,993
Who do you think I am?

494
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:04,448
Shut your mouth and crouch in here.

495
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:11,975
They're treating me like some dog.

496
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:49,386
"If I were king,

497
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:53,861
I'd redress an abuse that cuts back one-half of humankind."

498
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:57,348
"I would have women participate in all human rights,

499
00:28:57,348 --> 00:29:01,431
especially those of the mind."

500
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,687
What Emilie du Chatelet said in the 1700s,

501
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:09,308
doesn't sound awkward at all even now. Isn't that funny, Mom?

502
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:12,328
She was Voltaire's lover and sponsor.

503
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:14,611
They were academic companions,

504
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:19,167
and she fell in love with a 10-year-younger poet,

505
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,164
who was also an officer.

506
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:26,409
Why don't you live like her instead of becoming king?

507
00:29:27,138 --> 00:29:32,262
I plan to become king and live such a wonderful life as well.

508
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:37,037
That, I didn't get to think of.

509
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,118
It's not bad.

510
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,947
He has arrived.

511
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:05,147
These days, things must be tough for everyone because of me.

512
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:08,118
Not really for me.

513
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:10,717
I just say that I'm the old man on the back burner,

514
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:13,588
that I don't know anything nor do I have influence.

515
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:16,371
I'm also clueless

516
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:18,457
about what Hye Ryul is up to, Father.

517
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:20,297
You don't have to tell me that,

518
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:22,470
and I don't need to know.

519
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,379
I believe you will handle the issues outside the family,

520
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,608
but what concerns me are the family issues.

521
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,720
About Gun Do,

522
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,707
I'm putting up with him not to provoke him anymore,

523
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:37,247
but shamelessly enough,

524
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:40,178
he sits around the table with us in my house

525
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:42,947
and takes what he thinks he deserves.

526
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:44,748
Seeing him frustrates me to death,

527
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,651
however...

528
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:48,874
You're right, Father.

529
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,928
Provoking him more won't do any good.

530
00:30:50,928 --> 00:30:53,728
I think a little differently.

531
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,528
Grandpa, you're alive and well,

532
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:58,828
but he leaves the way open and offers the main room.

533
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:01,038
He will probably attempt to do more.

534
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,608
At first, I was flustered that Ham &amp; Lee was under attack.

535
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:06,408
Later, I doubted it.

536
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:10,277
But the moment Won Kyung said his target was Na Geun Woo,

537
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:12,913
I got a double take.

538
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,247
I had forgotten the biggest problem

539
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:18,587
was always within our family.

540
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,757
Now that he has shown his claws, he might even go for the head.

541
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:27,128
He intends to take over Ham &amp; Lee regardless of your presence.

542
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:29,004
I won't let that happen!

543
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:31,267
I will get his head instead.

544
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:35,197
Grandpa, a conflict will cause damage in any way,

545
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:39,778
and people are waiting for that to happen around me.

546
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,307
I can't give them what they want.

547
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,148
But he is obviously determined.

548
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:46,848
Will there be a way to avoid conflict?

549
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:51,213
I will cut off his connections.

550
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,570
Connections?

551
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,060
Yes.

552
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,897
Those who chime and instigate him,

553
00:31:56,897 --> 00:32:00,198
I will cut them off from him and bring them to my side.

554
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:03,098
That's the only way to bind his hand and foot.

555
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:07,201
I will embrace his surroundings.

556
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:10,707
I've known her since she was little.

557
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,737
She is easygoing and kind.

558
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:15,537
I don't mind having her as my daughter-in-law.

559
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:19,689
I will embrace Ji Yi.

560
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:24,328
The daughter of the head of the Central District Office...

561
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:28,517
That will only complicate the situation.

562
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:32,128
Won't it shrink your world?

563
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:35,188
The one who loves more is always on the losing end.

564
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:38,954
Ji Yi likes Kang Baek a lot,

565
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:43,255
and with her as a hostage, I won't have to walk on eggshells.

566
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:47,438
Kang Baek, just why are you being like this?

567
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:48,778
What is it this time?

568
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:50,533
"This time?"

569
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,708
I'm not a wife who grills her husband.

570
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,247
Don't put it like that.

571
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,888
What is it that annoyed you this time?

572
00:32:56,888 --> 00:33:00,228
Everything. Everything annoys me.

573
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,918
I just don't understand how you behave around Hong Nan Hee.

574
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:04,287
- You're always at her beck. 
 - I'm not.

575
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,358
You are. Do you even know what others say?

576
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,398
What others say doesn't matter.

577
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:10,698
I get along with her because she's a close friend.

578
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,558
All right, she's a close friend of yours.

579
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,029
What about me then?

580
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:19,038
You decided on the competition without asking me in advance.

581
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,310
I apologized for that.

582
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,410
Just that?

583
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,078
Is that all you thought you should apologize for?

584
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,377
How could you treat me like this?

585
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,118
Think of how you behave these days.

586
00:33:29,118 --> 00:33:31,687
What do I mean to you?

587
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,467
A pretty and cute friend.

588
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,942
And?

589
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:39,228
- Ji Yi. 
 - And?

590
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:42,063
Other than a friend!

591
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,820
Ji Yi, you see—

592
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,470
Try harder!

593
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:50,905
I've known you since kindergarten.

594
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,696
You always had my heart.

595
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:59,417
You comforted me, appeased me, and supported me.

596
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:03,500
I can't imagine my life without you.

597
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,288
- Ji Yi, that's— 
 - If you were going to break my heart now,

598
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,408
you shouldn't have been so kind from the start.

599
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:14,201
So try harder.

600
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:21,738
If all this is because of Hong Nan Hee,

601
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,858
I will never forgive you.

602
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:37,482
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:15,058
I don't feel like having Korean food today.

604
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,598
Would you like to have Western food instead?

605
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:22,158
You're offering to change the menu right away. That's not fun.

606
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:25,367
If I say, "It's going to take a lot of time,

607
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,967
so please have what was served today,"

608
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:30,868
you can throw another fit and say,

609
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:33,407
"Are you telling me to stop complaining and just eat?"

610
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,890
Will it be fun for you then?

611
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,180
Do you take joke lessons?

612
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,478
You can't learn how to make jokes.

613
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:43,620
If you think I have a sense of humor, I must be a natural.

614
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:48,091
That was hilarious!

615
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:51,618
Your sense of humor calls for violence.

616
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,342
What?

617
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:56,627
Why don't you again talk back at me with your gifted sense of humor?

618
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:59,598
Now you come at me every time I speak.

619
00:35:59,598 --> 00:36:02,822
Am I a joke to you?

620
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:05,302
Answer me!

621
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,534
That crazy witch is at it again.

622
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,647
She's a total lunatic.

623
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,518
Geez, I might be asked to set the table again.

624
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:16,147
I can't believe they took someone like her into this family.

625
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,387
They probably didn't know.

626
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:18,948
They wouldn't have done it had they known.

627
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:22,087
She becomes a refined lady around the family.

628
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,928
Doesn't Ms. Yang tell them about her?

629
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:26,297
Come on, I bet the family knows.

630
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,357
There's no way they are unaware of her temper.

631
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:31,502
They must be just feigning ignorance.

632
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:35,937
I always say this, but whatever they have in mind,

633
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:39,497
this family lives a life full of trouble.

634
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,607
All right.

635
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:42,337
Since she knocked over the Korean meal,

636
00:36:42,337 --> 00:36:44,078
let's try the Western meal this time.

637
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:47,478
I'm going to make steak, a salad, and consommé.

638
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:49,217
Get me the broth.

639
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,647
Gosh.

640
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:53,618
The dishes she smashed today are worth more than my monthly pay

641
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:55,217
and she did it without even batting an eye!

642
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:58,058
That lunatic's madness is ruining my mood!

643
00:36:58,058 --> 00:37:01,260
- Darn her! 
 - Drop this madness!

644
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,740
Hey!

645
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,697
Hey!

646
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:21,478
Hey!

647
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:25,150
- Let go of me! 
 - Don't move.

648
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,437
What do you think you are doing?

649
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:32,675
You darn scums!

650
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:37,728
A get-together must be with nothing more expensive than ox bone soup,

651
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:42,237
but this seems pricey enough for me to worry about future trouble.

652
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:44,422
This is why

653
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,908
I admire judicial officers,

654
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:49,168
because they know the law,

655
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:53,293
they're careful and cautious at all times.

656
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:56,448
Are you saying we're cowards?

657
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:59,495
That's right.

658
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,288
If you know the law,

659
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:07,328
you must be scared of how frightening the law can be.

660
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,257
It's not about just one person.

661
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:12,725
Three generations of a family can be ruined in an instant.

662
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:20,208
There you go suspecting again.

663
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,607
There's nothing here.

664
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:27,100
Recorders and cameras? There's nothing like them here.

665
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:28,817
Should I show you?

666
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:31,487
Goodness, you don't believe me.

667
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,217
- I have nothing. 
 - Gosh!

668
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:36,602
Please stop and sit down.

669
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:38,887
- I have absolutely nothing! 
 - I see.

670
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:41,328
- Let's talk at ease. 
 - Gosh.

671
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:42,763
Sure.

672
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:45,515
Goodness.

673
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:49,737
You're the butler of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

674
00:38:49,737 --> 00:38:53,978
According to Mr. Ham, your job is to clean up the mess.

675
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,670
Isn't that right, Mr. Nam?

676
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:02,388
Don't be upset.

677
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:05,188
Mr. Ham says that about Na Geun Woo too,

678
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:07,943
that he used to clean up his mess,

679
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:14,098
but these days, he thinks he got stabbed in the back.

680
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:20,337
His former underling seduced his daughter into joining his family,

681
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:22,693
and now, he's after Ham &amp; Lee.

682
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:29,308
So, are you saying you can't and won't trust me?

683
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:31,748
You talk just like him!

684
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:34,348
He said exactly the same thing.

685
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:38,317
You're different indeed, Mr. Nam.

686
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:41,357
This is why Mr. Ham of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation

687
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:46,694
keeps you very close to him, even when he can't trust you.

688
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:49,783
You see,

689
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:52,297
I thought I could break through this crisis

690
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,837
only with his help in any way.

691
00:39:54,837 --> 00:40:00,062
So I begged him with every means, except for going down on my knees,

692
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,505
but you know what he's like.

693
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:05,808
He's willing to take me down at any time.

694
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:07,147
Isn't this too harsh?

695
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:11,447
Honestly speaking, I had what could put Ham &amp; Lee into trouble.

696
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:16,157
We agreed to join hands, so I thought we'd be partners no matter what.

697
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:18,527
Goodness. Let me keep this short.

698
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:24,112
I'd like to ask you for your help.

699
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,743
Do you have a mess to be cleaned?

700
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:34,608
A lawyer's job is to clean up a mess.

701
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:37,078
A mess is the same, whoever causes it.

702
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:39,107
There's not much of a difference in how dirty and smelly it is.

703
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:42,492
I'm not so picky at choosing what to clean up.

704
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,101
So,

705
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:49,927
you don't mind whoever and whatever mess you clean up?

706
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,360
You will clean it up?

707
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,980
That won't be all.

708
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:57,816
As long as it's worthy, I can swallow it and even take the blame.

709
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:01,316
Goodness.

710
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,538
Only if I get to have someone like you on my side,

711
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:08,854
I'll be at ease regardless of how much trouble I cause.

712
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:14,147
Anyway, I'm sorry for not even touching the food,

713
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:16,348
but I will make up for this

714
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,388
with the determination to swallow and take the blame,

715
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,888
when I get the chance to clean something up.

716
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:24,847
I like to keep things clear.

717
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:27,660
Whether it's my mess or Mr. Ham's,

718
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,741
you don't care at all. Is that it?

719
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,248
Anyone can become a lawyer these days.

720
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:36,640
When you're paid to do the job, you don't care whose mess it is.

721
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:41,903
Well... I'll be off, then.

722
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:17,716
Close the door, will you? I can smell the filthy mess.

723
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:22,417
   

724
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,977
   

725
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,058
- Yes, sir. 
 - Hey, how did it go?

726
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:30,393
I just left.

727
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,902
He kept talking about cleaning up messes when we met for dinner.

728
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:38,198
He's about to wet his pants because he's scared,

729
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:43,198
thinking he's made a big mess, yet he's still bluffing.

730
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:48,230
I have to say, I think he'll be the easiest one to maneuver.

731
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,901
Right, I see. Sounds like he has an unusual taste.

732
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:57,032
Does talking about filth stimulate his appetite or something?

733
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:01,757
Did he talk about anything else?

734
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:04,677
That's all he talked about the whole time?

735
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,558
Okay, let's think about that.

736
00:43:08,558 --> 00:43:11,330
I always trust your judgment, you know.

737
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,737
So you think Mr. Ahn is the easiest one to maneuver.

738
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:19,237
Those who wet their pants and bluff are always the biggest pushovers.

739
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:21,478
You should call it an early night.

740
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:24,560
You must be exhausted after listening to his pathetic spiel.

741
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,948
Oh, have some food.

742
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:32,888
I bet you were too busy talking about your messes to eat earlier.

743
00:43:32,888 --> 00:43:34,623
Go on and eat.

744
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:37,647
Don't sit there grimacing.

745
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:45,728
I shouldn't have come today.

746
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:47,737
That's not true. You should be here.

747
00:43:47,737 --> 00:43:50,607
Director Yoon, this is how you learn.

748
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:52,268
This is how things work in politics.

749
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:54,978
Swallow and spit.

750
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:56,877
You have to master that craft.

751
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:58,448
If it's sweet, don't swallow it,

752
00:43:58,448 --> 00:44:00,968
and don't spit it out even if it's bitter.

753
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:06,176
It can save you or get you fired.

754
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:10,753
I'm learning a lot from you.

755
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,336
Please, let's eat.

756
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:30,873
I saw the interview.

757
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:36,478
Professor Hwang, I did not know that you were thinking that.

758
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:39,661
Ma'am, the thing is...

759
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:43,857
To be honest, considering the recent incidents

760
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:47,598
involving Jusung, we can't say that there are no problems...

761
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,728
Those who enjoy all the privileges

762
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,527
come with their professor titles,

763
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:53,268
including their six-figure salaries,

764
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:56,938
while vying for the opportunity to kick-start their political careers.

765
00:44:56,938 --> 00:44:59,538
You used to despise such professors. Am I wrong?

766
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:02,125
I'm sorry.

767
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,942
They got in touch with me urgently,

768
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:08,748
- so I couldn't turn it down. 
 - I see.

769
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,968
- Was it Jang Il? 
 - Pardon me?

770
00:45:10,968 --> 00:45:13,767
Did he ask you to do it?

771
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:18,858
- Ma'am, it was... 
 - Ji Yi

772
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:22,398
gets good grades in the class that you teach.

773
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:24,467
She always gets an A plus.

774
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:28,248
In her other classes, she gets mediocre grades.

775
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:40,148
You should reflect on yourself first,

776
00:45:40,148 --> 00:45:43,348
before you run your mouth about others' family matters.

777
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:52,336
Yes. You're right, ma'am.

778
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,335
   

779
00:46:20,888 --> 00:46:23,527
 Professor Hwang, I watched your interview. 

780
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,828
 That was exactly what I wanted to say. 

781
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:27,428
 It totally hit the mark. 

782
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:30,791
 Let's grab a drink soon. 

783
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:34,600
   

784
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:53,054
I got you.

785
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:13,676
   

786
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:24,072
Hi, honey. Are you busy today?

787
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:26,768
No. I have nothing going on today.

788
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:30,018
Really? Then how about we have dinner together?

789
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:33,221
Sure. Where do you want to go?

790
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:36,607
Well, just pick a place you like.

791
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,913
Oh, then...

792
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:43,908
How about that place? I don't remember the name.

793
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:45,519
You mean, Togata?

794
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,083
I like that place too.

795
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:51,202
Yes, that place.

796
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:55,748
Gosh, maybe we were right about us being geniuses.

797
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,888
Totally. We didn't even give our 100 percent.

798
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:00,658
Our fingers barely touched the keyboard,

799
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:01,958
but we passed the preliminaries.

800
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,627
Guys, we pulled three all-nighters in a row.

801
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:05,627
Don't you remember?

802
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:07,928
Not at all. Hey, it's about time you accepted it.

803
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,184
We're geniuses.

804
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:12,482
Goodness.

805
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:14,768
Oh, Ah Jeong's team passed the preliminaries too.

806
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,237
Ji Yi and Hyun's team?

807
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:17,237
- That's great. 
 - Yes.

808
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:19,638
They'd better avoid us in the finals.

809
00:48:19,638 --> 00:48:21,737
We'll totally beat them.

810
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:23,848
He always gets ahead of himself like this.

811
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:25,547
In his mind, we already won.

812
00:48:25,547 --> 00:48:26,978
Guys, don't talk to me for a moment.

813
00:48:26,978 --> 00:48:31,078
I'm trying to decide what I should buy with the prize money.

814
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,337
Oh, hey!

815
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:38,757
We passed the preliminaries. Did you see it?

816
00:48:38,757 --> 00:48:42,098
Yes. You should start getting ready for the finals.

817
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:45,228
Understanding the Supreme Court's previous rulings and precedents

818
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:47,996
is always so important.

819
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:50,697
That said,

820
00:48:51,368 --> 00:48:53,148
I have to go to the library.

821
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:56,228
This is only the beginning!

822
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,756
Let's...

823
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:02,889
We can do this.

824
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,018
We can do it!

825
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:05,798
- Let's do this! 
 - Let's do this!

826
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:14,647
- Professor Na. 
 - Hello.

827
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,127
You came a little early today.

828
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,828
Yes, I'm taking her out for dinner.

829
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:21,052
Oh, I see.

830
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,886
Ms. Han,

831
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:28,237
you look a little different.

832
00:49:28,237 --> 00:49:30,681
Hey, don't get cheeky with me.

833
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:31,778
You're early.

834
00:49:31,778 --> 00:49:35,442
- Yes, there was no traffic. 
 - I see.

835
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,147
- I'm off. 
 - Okay.

836
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:40,892
Mr. Oh, you should go home soon too.

837
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:44,027
You know that we're in this for the long haul, right?

838
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:47,960
Go out on a date here and there, so you can keep going.

839
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,747
Like you?

840
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:52,278
Yes, like us.

841
00:49:52,278 --> 00:49:53,527
I'll see you tomorrow.

842
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,460
- See you soon. 
 - Bye.

843
00:50:12,518 --> 00:50:13,547
   

844
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:17,736
 Eun Mi, are you free later? 

845
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,328
- Ta-da. 
 - Wow.

846
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:25,911
This is how I roll.

847
00:50:26,897 --> 00:50:28,897
But seriously, what's up with you today?

848
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:34,078
I took time out of my busy schedule to see you, Eun Mi.

849
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:37,448
There's definitely something in the air at the Prosecutors' Office.

850
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:41,478
My sissy, nerdy boyfriend has turned into a swindler.

851
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:43,417
Clearly, your boss left early today.

852
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:45,248
But what? You made time for me?

853
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:46,487
What?

854
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,004
Hey! Stop it.

855
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:52,775
Go away.

856
00:50:52,775 --> 00:50:54,599
I love you.

857
00:50:55,257 --> 00:50:57,442
That tickles.

858
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:02,999
Why are you so sweet today?

859
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,787
It feels like I'm going to melt.

860
00:51:05,787 --> 00:51:08,492
Were you always this sweet?

861
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:11,348
I want to live like this.

862
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:13,663
Like this? How?

863
00:51:15,118 --> 00:51:21,061
I want to have the strength to stick to my beliefs while...

864
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:25,586
Yes. I want to always be this sweet.

865
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:31,763
Wow. So you'll be ambitious and sweet?

866
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,118
My boss taught me

867
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:39,241
that you need power to defend your beliefs.

868
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:42,751
Oh, you realized that just now?

869
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:49,385
As the line from "Parasite" says, "What you need is vigor."

870
00:51:51,147 --> 00:51:55,451
But do you know what a famous film critic said?

871
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:59,487
"Vigor comes from your social status."

872
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:04,074
Isn't that awesome?

873
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:06,948
That impressed me.

874
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:08,598
That's the truth.

875
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:11,538
Whether it's your vigor or belief or dignity,

876
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:14,517
it all comes from your social status.

877
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:16,558
Right.

878
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:19,454
Ms. Han, who sticks to her belief,

879
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:21,805
looks wonderful.

880
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:26,047
Are you complimenting another girl in front of your girlfriend?

881
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:27,518
Look, young lady.

882
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:30,527
Ms. Han fixed her makeup before she left,

883
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,527
for her dinner date with Professor Na.

884
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,547
I promised myself, "Right,

885
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:38,461
I should make Eun Mi live that way."

886
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:42,768
Even a long time after we're married,

887
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:45,208
you should still feel that I'm sweet.

888
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:48,428
- But what were you saying? 
 - I'm touched.

889
00:52:48,428 --> 00:52:51,452
That's really touching,

890
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,917
but you're not proposing to me

891
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,097
in the hotel room full of case records, are you?

892
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:02,012
What do you take me for?

893
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,383
I'm sorry.

894
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:10,357
Speaking of which, is what we see from that couple really everything?

895
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,781
You think so?

896
00:53:12,781 --> 00:53:14,237
Yes.

897
00:53:14,237 --> 00:53:17,808
Sometimes Professor Na comes to the Prosecution Service after work.

898
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:22,884
When Ms. Han looks tired, he escorts her home.

899
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:25,625
He's too perfect.

900
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:28,452
Way too perfect.

901
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:30,545
So thorough.

902
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:34,458
Here.

903
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:38,358
You like calamari, especially from this restaurant.

904
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:41,274
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

905
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:42,657
Are you okay with your time today?

906
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:44,842
Isn't this your busy season?

907
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:48,907
No matter how busy I am, I should make myself available to you.

908
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:53,409
You don't trust me? It's true.

909
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:56,117
I'm just thankful.

910
00:53:57,078 --> 00:53:59,478
Is something wrong?

911
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:01,155
No.

912
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:04,348
It doesn't sound like it.

913
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:10,464
Is it hard to deal with my mom outside?

914
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:14,041
I'm really sorry.

915
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:17,228
I know it's beyond understanding.

916
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,668
I understand how tough that is.

917
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:21,668
Even I find her too much sometimes.

918
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:24,431
It must be worse for you.

919
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:28,578
You see, sometimes it's too much for me

920
00:54:28,578 --> 00:54:30,708
when she sees her unaccomplished dreams in me.

921
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:36,719
But because I'm her daughter, I understand how she feels

922
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:39,008
to lose and be forced off.

923
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,936
No wonder she hates me.

924
00:54:42,936 --> 00:54:46,338
- A man like me doesn't deserve— 
 - Geun Woo,

925
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:48,828
there's something she doesn't know.

926
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:53,098
She thinks I was too naive to fall for you.

927
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:56,867
Everyone thinks their child is naive and immature,

928
00:54:56,867 --> 00:54:59,108
or that's how they want to believe it.

929
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:04,978
She doesn't want to know how clever I could be.

930
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:08,985
Even though I'm still her child, it's still scary.

931
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:17,963
When I chose you, I bet all my pride.

932
00:55:17,963 --> 00:55:20,602
My pride.

933
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:23,121
I wouldn't do that for anyone.

934
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:27,015
Me? Han Hye Ryul?

935
00:55:28,698 --> 00:55:32,582
That's who you are.

936
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:36,012
You're really amazing.

937
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:43,062
Cheers.

938
00:55:52,027 --> 00:55:53,764
Mom!

939
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:03,957
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

940
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:09,355
You were here?

941
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:11,922
Yes.

942
00:56:14,578 --> 00:56:17,917
Kang Baek is here because he knows you like this place.

943
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:21,157
Yes. I knew this was your favorite place.

944
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:25,528
We got the result for the mock trial preliminary round.

945
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:27,804
We passed it easily.

946
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,998
I see. Congratulations.

947
00:56:29,998 --> 00:56:32,774
- Good job. 
 - Thank you.

948
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:35,583
So I said I would treat them.

949
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:38,538
It seems you just started.

950
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:41,681
May we join you?

951
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:45,047
I could get a more expensive dish that way,

952
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:46,903
right?

953
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,417
I was actually worried we'd be done after the appetizer.

954
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:52,348
This place is really expensive.

955
00:56:52,348 --> 00:56:54,918
You'll be surprised, once, by the flavor, and twice, by the price.

956
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:56,058
Come on.

957
00:56:56,058 --> 00:56:58,587
You said I had to try their beef risotto.

958
00:56:58,587 --> 00:56:59,828
Now you say that?

959
00:56:59,828 --> 00:57:02,408
That's not the problem right now.

960
00:57:02,408 --> 00:57:06,168
They look too romantic for us to join them.

961
00:57:06,168 --> 00:57:08,323
You think so?

962
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:11,157
Were you having an important conversation?

963
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:30,865
   

964
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:32,628
 Hello? 

965
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:35,398
 Honey, where are you? Aren't you at school? 

966
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:38,018
 Why did you call this number? 

967
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:43,038
 Because you should be at school, but you turned your phone off 

968
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:45,742
 and never checked it. 

969
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:49,604
 What? Do you find my calls a hassle? 

970
00:57:51,007 --> 00:57:52,507
 Did you call? 

971
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,447
 Sorry, I was busy. 

972
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:57,904
 I'm in a rush to leave. 

973
00:57:57,904 --> 00:57:59,981
 Are you busy tonight? 

974
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:03,191
 A little. 

975
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,406
 What are you up to? 

976
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:07,511
 Well... 

977
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:11,297
 Someone needs to talk to me regarding legislation. 

978
00:58:11,297 --> 00:58:13,101
 I see. 

979
00:58:15,098 --> 00:58:17,437
 Stop nagging my husband. 

980
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:20,697
 Stop nagging my husband. 

981
00:58:21,737 --> 00:58:23,407
 Regarding legislation? 

982
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:25,308
 That's very important. 

983
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:27,095
 You should get going, 

984
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:29,717
 but you have to make yourself available for me tomorrow. 

985
00:58:29,717 --> 00:58:34,282
 I miss you so much, but I'll wait. 

986
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:05,948
   

987
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:08,391
   

988
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:12,427
 I transferred all the files to the USB flash drive, just in case, 

989
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,827
 to be prepared for anything. 

990
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:16,997
 Thank you. 

991
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:20,038
   

992
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:29,010



993
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:35,378
   

994
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:37,574
   

995
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,830
♫  Take off the mask  ♫

996
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,020
♫  Show me your face  ♫

997
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:55,550
   

998
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:02,020
♫  Why are you trying to hide it? 

999
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,980
♫  Sing out your voice as sharp as an awl  ♫

1000
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,670
♫  Reveal yourself  ♫

1001
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:20,200
♫  Get out into the world  ♫

1002
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,710
♫  Why do you want to hide?  ♫

1003
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,610
♫  Tell me why  ♫

1004
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,538
 You're smart, 

1005
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:39,637
 but why aren't you taking advantage of me? 

1006
01:01:39,637 --> 01:01:42,507
 Just what can he do from here? 

1007
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:43,808
 Has he gone mad? 

1008
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,248
 How could he mention me? I have nothing to do with that. 

1009
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,047
 I have never met that jerk! 

1010
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:51,447
 Since the cat is out of the bag, we don't know what he has. 

1011
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:53,748
 Don't you dare mess with me again. 

1012
01:01:53,748 --> 01:01:57,157
 Kang Baek, bring Ji Yi home this weekend. 

1013
01:01:57,157 --> 01:01:59,427
 Kang Baek is the only one for me. 

1014
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:01,157
 Do everything you can to stop the investigation on Jusung. 

1015
01:02:01,157 --> 01:02:03,197
 I will not let that girl beat me. 

1016
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:06,398
 I'm really sorry, but I can't let you do what you want with my marriage. 

1017
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:08,167
 What do you gain from this? 

1018
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,498
 What is it that you want? 

1019
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:11,578
 Kang Baek and I love each other, 

1020
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:13,730
 Mother.
