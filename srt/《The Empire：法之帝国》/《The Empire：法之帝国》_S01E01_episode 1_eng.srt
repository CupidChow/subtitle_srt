1
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:03,848
   

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:05,447
   

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:08,548
 Oh, my. What's up with the vibe here? You know? 

4
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:12,317
 My manager said I had an offer to be an MC at a book concert. 

5
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:16,658
I thought, "Why would they want an A-list MC like me?"

6
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:20,557
I wondered if selling these books would be enough to cover my fee.

7
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:22,657
That's what I thought.

8
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,897
But when I heard it was for Professor Na Geun Woo...

9
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,767
The leading presidential candidate.

10
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,408
   

11
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,838
The idol star with 50 million fans!

12
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:36,338
   

13
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:39,778
I thought that I had to be here even if I had to pay to get in.

14
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,216
That's right!

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,587
So that's why I'm here today,

16
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:44,587
but after looking at the atmosphere here

17
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,257
and the scale of the press today,

18
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:50,228
this event is more significant than a concert by a top idol group.

19
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:55,427
Wait. Is it possible that he's announcing his presidential candidacy today?

20
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:02,297
Don't tell me I was the only one who was kept in the dark... okay.

21
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:05,137
All right. You've been waiting for a long time now.

22
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,877
 He graduated from Seoul National University with a law degree. 

23
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:10,146
 He passed the bar exam in his 20s and served as a judge. 

24
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:13,807
 He now works at Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, the best law firm in Korea. 

25
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,088
 On top of that, he's a professor at Minguk University Law School. 

26
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:20,998
He's the leader of the new generation in Korea!

27
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:26,457
No. He's the symbol of intelligence with the biggest influence now.

28
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,128
He's got all the best genes.

29
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,298
He's so cool.

30
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,020
This is Professor Na Geun Woo!

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:39,060



32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,807
 - There she is. 
 - She's here. 

33
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,678
She's pulling in.

34
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:48,877
Take the photos.

35
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:52,010
Step back now.

36
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:04,790
   

37
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:29,827
- You're so cool! 
 - We love you!

38
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:32,757
   

39
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,907
- You're amazing! 
 - Over here, sir!

40
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:37,366
Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul, will you keep investigating Jusung?

41
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,567
Some people call it "the open revolution". Any comment?

42
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:42,297
Is it true there's a conflict between you and your ex-husband, Prosecutor Ko Won Kyung?

43
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,436
- A comment, please. 
 - Prosecutor Han.

44
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:45,287
- Prosecutor Han! 
 - Prosecutor Han!

45
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,376
- Prosecutor Han! 
 - A comment, please!

46
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,307
- Prosecutor Han! 
 - Prosecutor Han!

47
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,877
Tell the vice chairman of Jusung to come in.

48
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:56,628
I don't want his minions. Bring me the vice chairman.

49
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:59,387
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,487
   

51
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,708
Honey, you're home.

52
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,917
My goodness. You cooked cheonggukjang  (soybean paste stew) .

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,617
That's the first thing you say to your husband?

54
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:34,117
Gosh. Sorry. It smelled so good.

55
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:34,917
I'm hungry.

56
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,157
Go wash up. I just have to scoop up the rice.

57
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:40,127
Gosh. You made rolled omelets too?

58
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,358
Can I just have a piece?

59
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,027
All right.

60
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:48,067
Here.

61
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,007
This is delicious.

62
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,577
It's so good, honey.

63
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:02,747
Since I cooked dinner, you prepare snacks for wine.

64
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,588
Okay.

65
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:33,277
The wine has just enough tannins for your taste,

66
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,478
and this is a nice full-bodied wine.

67
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,548
Thanks.

68
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,857
Cut!

69
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,287
- You guys look great. 
 - Gosh.

70
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,827
Didn't I sound too awkward?

71
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,157
Gosh, no. Not at all.

72
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:53,897
When you were preparing the salad earlier, you tore the romaine lettuce with your hands,

73
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:56,267
and it looked like you knew how to cook.

74
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,768
She actually is a good cook.

75
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,377
Gosh, no.

76
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:05,108
Why? No one makes bulgogi  (fire meat)  with glass noodles better than you.

77
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:57,397
You look even more ravishing today.

78
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,728
Let's come back here tomorrow.

79
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:04,968
I rented this place for a week because of the filming.

80
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:07,287
Then I won't let you leave tonight.

81
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,538
Let's get a nice hotel room next week.

82
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,047
- Really? 
 - Yes.

83
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:53,817
- You'll keep going at it? 
 - You bet.

84
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,287
It won't be an easy fight.

85
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,986
It won't be fun if it's too easy.

86
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:01,658
Goodness. That's so you.

87
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,127
You'll support me, right?

88
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:09,168
Oh, my. Of course. Not just anyone is asking me for my support.

89
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:12,268
Who's asking?

90
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:15,537
My wife, the coolest woman on earth.

91
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:18,738
The order is coming from Ms. Han Hye Ryul.

92
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:25,347
Prosecution is an independent office.

93
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:29,058
A prosecutor is an individual,

94
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:32,557
as well as an organization that can exercise the prosecuting authority.

95
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,697
   

96
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:36,366
Then according to what you said, is it fair to understand that

97
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:43,098
Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul's arbitrary investigation of Jusung is legitimate?

98
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:47,608
It's not an arbitrary investigation. It's an independent investigation.

99
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,808
Let me ask you again.

100
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:55,508
The vice chairman of Jusung, the target of this investigation, is the husband of Prosecutor Han's sister.

101
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,377
In other words, he's her brother-in-law.

102
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:04,748
As this wasn't an easy decision, many of our viewers are interested in Prosecutor Han's intention.

103
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,897
"Prosecution must be reformed."

104
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:11,027
"No one is above the law. Jusung isn't an exception."

105
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:16,597
That's the intention of Prosecutor Han which I confirmed again this morning.

106
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,067
That must be the latest update.

107
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,038
   

108
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,236
Today, her independent investigation has been labeled as arbitrary and criticized.

109
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:31,417
This is an example that shows that prosecution still hasn't left behind the top-down structure.

110
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:35,488
The best time to reform prosecution is today.

111
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,988
It must begin today.

112
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,407
Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul!

113
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:55,176
Were you aware that Jusung wouldn't be attending today's event?

114
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,277
Rumor has it that the higher-ups are against your investigation.

115
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:59,977
Do you plan to indict him despite the conflict?

116
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:04,046
Your husband, Professor Na Geun Woo, is discussed as a leading presidential candidate.

117
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,656
Some people think you guys are trying to stay in the spotlight.

118
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,507
What are your thoughts on that?

119
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,226
- Please answer a question! 
 - A comment, please!

120
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:12,527
- Just one question! 
 - Prosecutor Han!

121
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,927
- This is great. 
 - Hey.

122
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:38,867
There hasn't been a day when you don't look stunning.

123
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:45,538
That's a run-of-the-mill compliment that isn't like you.

124
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:49,077
That's such boring praise to a gorgeous queen like her.

125
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,928
I didn't know you guys were this genial.

126
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,897
You weren't so kind this afternoon.

127
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:58,068
Why would I be nice to you?

128
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,507
After your reality show aired,

129
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,978
your approval ratings for presidential candidacy went up,

130
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,917
but thanks to that, my ratings at home went down.

131
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,947
You became the known enemy of every husband in Korea.

132
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,818
I guess it was my fault.

133
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,958
- Here. 
 - Hey.

134
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,927
Excuse me.

135
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,168
You're here.

136
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,337
- Yes. 
 - Where are your seats?

137
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,938
We're on the first floor.

138
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:36,778
We're grateful that you got us seats.

139
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:39,678
You look so stunning today. Your dress looks divine.

140
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:43,848
Is that so? That's a compliment to the professor's taste.

141
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:45,710
He's the one who picked it out.

142
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,180
Really?

143
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,456
He always dresses nicely, so I thought it all came from you.

144
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:54,188
His outfits are perfect, even up to his shoes.

145
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:58,226
I have no interest in fashion. I don't have time for it either.

146
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:00,767
He tells me to dress better and buys me clothes,

147
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,937
and I comply by wearing them because I don't want him to nag me.

148
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:06,937
He coordinates all of my outfits.

149
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,748
You have one more charm to add to your list.

150
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:17,747
Are you trying to appeal to your students with your charms, not with your class?

151
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:19,117
Didn't you know?

152
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,087
Students don't take his class for the content.

153
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:26,027
We take his class because he's teaching it.

154
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:37,338
I can understand that. Everyone has similar tastes.

155
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,118
I must consider you a property of the public,

156
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,837
as long as it's for the welfare of the people.

157
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,706
I can't let my jealousy get the better of me.

158
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:49,118
I want to have a marriage just like yours, Mother.

159
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:53,717
I have to prepare for the legal clinic after the concert, so I'll be late.

160
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,958
- Again? 
 - Yes.

161
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,107
You're in charge of the case, Professor Na. You're coming, right?

162
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,258
Well, after the concert...

163
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,638
Sorry. I can't let you have him tonight.

164
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,507
The ownership is clear here.

165
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,958
We can't seem to argue otherwise.

166
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,437
They're so happy together.

167
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,317
All good.

168
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:26,688
Look at her, acting so snobby.

169
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,688
Goodness.

170
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:33,957
How can a mere senior prosecutor treat the Senior Presidential Secretary as if she's better than him?

171
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:37,098
Instead of saying hello to me, she just stood there.

172
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,997
How dare she walk over to her son the moment he beckoned to her?

173
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,048
You know she thinks she's a princess.

174
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,737
She basically wants us to get permission for an audience.

175
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,968
Princess, my foot.

176
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,468
She's just acting arrogant because of her dad.

177
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:52,207
Both of them are going after Jusung and making a huge scene,

178
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,777
and I can't face the president because of that.

179
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,248
The president of the university... and the Prosecutor General can't stop them either, right?

180
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:02,058
That's why this is driving me crazy.

181
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:04,387
Think about it. Her own sister is married to the Jusung family.

182
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:06,128
What is she trying to do right now?

183
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:09,328
It's because her sister is married to the Jusung family.

184
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,997
What?

185
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,267
A prosecutor who doesn't even go easy on her in-laws or her brother-in-law,

186
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,808
and the good-looking and smart husband defends her

187
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:23,238
in the eye of the law. He's the perfect husband.

188
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,547
He's sexy, isn't he?

189
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:29,118
How's that going to help anyone?

190
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:32,718
You saw the approval ratings for Na Geun Woo as a presidential candidate.

191
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:36,287
He has no experience in politics, and he's never shown any interest in candidacy, but that's the number he got.

192
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,357
The approval ratings can't be held seriously.

193
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,597
It's just a popularity vote.

194
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:42,828
The public has no idea what politics is.

195
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:47,697
Because they're going after the conglomerate, Jusung, people think that justice is being served

196
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,566
and they will protect the powerless from injustices.

197
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,538
That's what they think,

198
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:57,006
but the public has no idea that once these prosecutors resign, they do everything to satisfy their greed.

199
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:59,947
In a way, this is for the better,

200
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,847
that they seem perfect and noble.

201
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:04,488
What do you mean?

202
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:10,418
That kind of reputation will backfire later because people will not be so willing

203
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:14,627
to forgive the smallest flaws at times like these.

204
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:30,848
   

205
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:44,688
Let me make a call and use the restroom.

206
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:49,786
- Is it urgent? 
 - Yes, it's for my column. They must have a lot to edit.

207
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,687
- You should go call them then. 
 - Sorry.

208
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,838
 Hello? 

209
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,107
Why did you call me at this number?

210
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,737
 I thought you would only have this phone with you now. 

211
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:11,806
Exactly. Why? Is something wrong?

212
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:16,947
 They didn't open up the seats on the third floor, so the restroom on that floor will be empty. 

213
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:21,087
- What are you implying? 
  - The women's room. 

214
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:22,958
 There's only one women's room on the third floor. 

215
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,727
 I'll wait for you there. 

216
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,857
 If you don't hurry, you'll miss the second part. 

217
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,188
Where are you going?

218
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,388
Isn't it obvious?

219
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:04,286
Are you going to the bathroom, full of people, in that dress?

220
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:07,798
I'm saying this out of my affection for you.

221
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:10,158
I must protect your classy image.

222
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:14,497
Use the one on the third floor. No one is in that restroom.

223
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,568
Is that so? Should I do that then?

224
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:18,238
I'll go with you then.

225
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:21,168
- Thanks. 
 - Don't mention it.

226
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:52,537
You see, I just can't believe that you are

227
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:54,308
Kang Baek's mother.

228
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,540
I swear you look like his older sister.

229
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,447
You're putting me on a pedestal.

230
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,648
I mean it.

231
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:11,808
I didn't know you liked shopping that much.

232
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:13,788
It will be over soon like an interview.

233
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:16,698
I'll be training in the field soon. Get me an outfit.

234
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,698
Okay.

235
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,117
Come to the legal clinic today.

236
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,598
I can't do that.

237
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,467
- Come. 
 - I'll think about it.

238
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,638
I said, "Come."

239
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:32,978
I'll be a little late.

240
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,777
That's my man.

241
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,778
- Ma'am, it's almost time. 
 - Oh!

242
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:45,948
Okay.

243
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,067
- Older Mi Ja. 
 - Yes?

244
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:05,967
- Put this on a plate. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

245
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,136
- Younger Mi Ja. 
 - Yes?

246
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:12,378
- Have this ready to go. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

247
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:16,348
- Chef Kim. 
 - Yes?

248
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:19,947
Mother prefers to have her oboktang  (stew)  hot. Don't forget that.

249
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:20,857
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,988
She mentioned carrot juice.

251
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:24,456
Did the carrots arrive from Jeju?

252
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,456
Yes, early in the morning today.

253
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,857
She needs to drink it before breakfast.

254
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:31,057
Oh, sure. I'll have it ready right away.

255
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,827
Make one more glass for my husband.

256
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:37,666
Serve him a scone and compote to have with it too.

257
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,167
Sure thing.

258
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,907
This is the schedule after breakfast.

259
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:18,707
- Good morning, Mom. 
 - Did you stay up all night again?

260
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:22,418
- Well...
 - It's going to damage your skin.

261
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,517
- Good morning, kids.
 - Good morning, Grandma.

262
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,016
Did you have a good night?

263
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:28,017
Yes, thank you for asking.

264
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:32,327
Grandma, why must we have breakfast this early?

265
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:34,797
Because everyone has to go to work early.

266
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:37,297
But I go to school, not work,

267
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:38,727
and it's way before time.

268
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:41,678
We've got to see each other before going to work.

269
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:44,198
We can see each other on the weekends.

270
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,806
Family members see each other every day.

271
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:49,408
Oh, please.

272
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:53,247
I think it's about time you got used to this, Princess.

273
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,547
Good morning.

274
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,717
- Go on in. 
 - Okay.

275
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,187
I'm not late, am I?

276
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,618
- The zipper. 
 - Oh, my.

277
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:08,597
Goodness, my pumpkins!

278
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,197
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

279
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:19,366
Mother, your skin looks so fair today.

280
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,538
Really?

281
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,606
Maybe it's thanks to the hanbang  (traditional Korean medicine)  skin product you got me last week.

282
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:26,548
Apply enough. I'll get you more before you run out of it.

283
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:28,218
Thank you.

284
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,277
It seemed effective,

285
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:32,547
so I was thinking of applying a lot on my neck and hands anyway.

286
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:35,756
Then why don't you apply some on your feet too?

287
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:37,687
I can't do that.

288
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,527
It costs 1 million Korean won per product.

289
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,928
Mother.

290
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,797
Apply it to your feet too.

291
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,628
Now I'm embarrassed, honey.

292
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,667
Let us pray.

293
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:54,908
"Do not boast about tomorrow,

294
00:23:54,908 --> 00:24:00,377
for you do not know what a day may bring forth."

295
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:05,076
"Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth."

296
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:10,316
"Let an outsider praise you, and not your own lips."

297
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,058
Proverbs 27.

298
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:17,457
Dear Almighty, please let us not be full of arrogance

299
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:23,167
and protect us so that we can follow your words in life.

300
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:29,438
Thank you for this food you've given us with grace.

301
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:32,348
- Amen. 
 - Amen.

302
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:43,147
"Dear brothers and sisters, honor those who are your leaders in the Lord's work."

303
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:47,328
"They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance."

304
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:53,467
"Show them great respect and wholehearted love because of their work,

305
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:57,398
and live peacefully with each other."

00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,107
Judge Han.

315
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:33,867
Mom, she's a total nutjob!

316
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,307
How dare she mess with Jusung? They're our in-laws!

317
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:39,747
It's not a bad idea because they are our in-laws.

318
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,717
No, it's actually better that they are our in-laws.

320
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:48,117
You are a judge after all, being so inflexible.

321
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:50,887
I thought our rule was not to talk about business with family,

322
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:53,128
and I think that's only right.

323
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:57,497
Mom, look at how she behaves!

324
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:59,228
Dad.

325
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:01,467
Why did you marry me off into the Jusung family?

326
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,166
It wasn't only for my sake.

327
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,567
Judge Han, calm down and sit down first.

328
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,978
Mom, how do you expect me to calm down now?

329
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,206
Today, I came all the way here despite the busy schedule

330
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,617
because my in-laws kept giving me the eye!

331
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:16,418
I got chewed out!

332
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:20,988
Sorry. I have no leisure to look after your in-laws.

333
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:26,056
Lucky you. You don't have to mind your in-laws, thanks to your husband who is almost an orphan.

334
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,687
Right.

335
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,897
He's a perfect guy.

336
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:31,467
Hold your horses.

337
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,766
I know how you feel,

338
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,168
but how about taking a deep breath first?

339
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,437
This is enough.

340
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,238
Don't ask for trouble.

341
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:43,608
Who do you think you are?

342
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:50,717
A prosecutor.

343
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,957
Senior, let's take it easy.

344
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:03,327
Then will you be my white knight, Pro Oh?

345
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:06,397
- Go, Han Hye Ryul. 
 - Go, Han Hye Ryul!

346
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:09,467
- Go, Han Hye Ryul! 
 - Go, Han Hye Ryul!

347
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:13,307
- Go, Han Hye Ryul! 
 - Go, Han Hye Ryul!

348
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,747
Dear my seniors, juniors, and colleagues.

349
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:22,247
I realize something as I get older.

350
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:28,347
I, Han Hye Ryul, sure am a butcher.

351
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:32,388
- So... 
 - Say no more.

352
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:34,697
You don't know what I will say next.

353
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:38,858
I think I already know, so save it, you brat.

354
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:43,467
Oh, I guess you've been reported right away.

355
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:47,938
This is why people say prosecutors are conglomerates' dogs.

356
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,287
Hey.

357
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:02,687
How dare you raise your voice at me?

358
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:07,357
And are you acting up because your father has your back?

359
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:10,858
You came right at my weakness.

360
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,366
Whatever I do, you want others to see it

361
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:16,868
as a troublemaker pulling her father's strings, don't you?

362
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:20,636
But I believe you pull his strings more than I do.

363
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,877
So let's drink and decide.

364
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:27,148
The loser will give in.

365
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:30,748
Hey.

366
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,287
I'm quite experienced in this.

367
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:37,688
It's what made me come this far.

368
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:40,757
Okay.

369
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:45,398
If you win, I'll support you with something very cool.

370
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:48,667
You need a promotion, don't you?

371
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,436
Someone even got a chief prosecutor title with this.

372
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:54,537
A promotion as what, a deputy chief?

373
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:56,907
Okay, all right.

374
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:58,377
Try out for a chief prosecutor title.

375
00:28:58,377 --> 00:29:02,948
I think you can make it. It's possible.

376
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:05,987
If drinking this will get me there...

377
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:32,007
I'll aim all the way up to a prosecutor general title.

378
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,587
I won't mess with Jusung.

379
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,358
I promise.

380
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:05,477
- Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up!

381
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,077
- Bottoms up! 
 - Drink it.

382
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:08,647
- All the way! 
 - All the way!

383
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,947
Drink it!

384
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,587
- All the way! 
 - All the way!

385
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:13,788
- Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up!

386
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:16,488
- Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up!

387
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:24,767
Let me down.

388
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,997
- This way. 
 - No, I can drink more!

389
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:28,697
- Goodbye! 
 - Gosh.

390
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:30,567
- Let's go. 
 - Goodbye!

391
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,007
- Hey. 
 - Goodness.

392
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:35,476
- Let me down. 
 - Goodness.

393
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:38,138
I said I...

394
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:40,606
- All right. 
 - Why did you...

395
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,518
Everyone, attention!

396
00:30:44,387 --> 00:30:46,288
Right this moment.

397
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:47,956
- Right this moment! 
 - Right this moment!

398
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:50,916
I have been called upon by the nation and its people.

399
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,357
- I have been called upon... 
 - I have been called upon...

400
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:53,986
- by the nation and its people. 
 - by the nation and its people.

401
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:57,426
I have taken the honor to be a prosecutor in Korea.

402
00:30:57,426 --> 00:30:58,967
- I have taken the honor... 
 - I have taken the honor...

403
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,827
- to be a prosecutor in Korea. 
 - to be a prosecutor in Korea.

404
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,467
As a public servant,

405
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,968
I shall uphold justice and human rights.

406
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:06,737
- As a public servant, 
 - As a public servant,

407
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:09,006
- I shall uphold justice and human rights. 
 - I shall uphold justice and human rights.

408
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:13,807
I shall protect my neighbors and community from criminal acts.

409
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,416
- I shall protect my neighbors... 
 - I shall protect my neighbors...

410
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,846
- and community from criminal acts. 
 - and community from criminal acts.

411
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:23,417
This darn heavy duty has been given to me!

412
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:27,157
- This darn heavy duty has been given to me! 
 - This darn heavy duty has been given to me!

413
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:28,226
Let's go!

414
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,797
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

415
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,967
Yes!

416
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,267
Yes!

417
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,478
I'm acting up because my father has my back?

418
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:49,548
Hey, it's so...

419
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,188
What's wrong with you all?

420
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:57,057
Since when did we go by the law

421
00:31:57,057 --> 00:32:00,527
that you're acting so true to the law?

422
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,628
Has anything worked out by the law?

423
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:07,228
No, and that's why people hire lawyers.

424
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:11,767
Dear lawyers, let's not be like this.

425
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,667
Our purpose is sales.

426
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:17,938
Have a business mind, not a legal mind.

427
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:29,788
Our university's purpose is simple.

428
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:33,028
An honorable admission and graduation.

429
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:35,958
A law school strictly for those qualified.

430
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:40,496
An alma mater that makes everyone envious.

431
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:44,237
That is why we rake in scholarships from Jusung Foundation

432
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:47,868
and provide our professors with the best benefits,

433
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:50,777
but we're second in terms of the bar exam pass rate?

434
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,347
Why couldn't you do a better job?

435
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,917
The law school of Minguk University...

436
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:03,788
Everyone knows what it is,

437
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:09,787
but no one actually focuses on the details of "The Last Judgment" right here.

438
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:15,726
At the age of 61, Michelangelo spent six years completing this masterpiece.

439
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,438
In 1517,

440
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:20,506
to warn the confusing times and the Christian society,

441
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:23,078
which was corrupted enough to cause the Protestant Reformation,

442
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:27,678
Pope Paul III made certain decisions and they're included in this.

443
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,716
It portrays the seriousness of the corruption at that time,

444
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:33,548
as it criticizes the corrupted society.

445
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:40,158
Once again, it was the year 1517.

446
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:46,197
Now after 500 years, has anything changed from then?

447
00:33:46,197 --> 00:33:48,197
What do you think?

448
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,408
Everyone says history shows development.

449
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,077
Technology made surprising changes to human life,

450
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,447
but crimes, punishments, and legal irregularities

451
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:03,617
haven't changed much from what Josef K faced in the novel,

452
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:07,047
"The Trial" written by Kafka, 100 years ago.

453
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:09,548
Is this too much of a leap to say?

454
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,717
I am...

455
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,888
ignorant about the law.

456
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:17,057
It's true.

457
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,166
When I was a judge, there wasn't even once

458
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:23,837
that everyone agreed to my ruling with satisfaction.

459
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:27,007
Instead, all of them said it was unfair.

460
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,707
They wanted to kill me.

461
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,837
They called me names,

462
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:38,017
so I looked things up again to see if I made a mistake in applying the law.

463
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,647
Before we get started, let me tell you something.

464
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:44,717
I mean, to put it professionally, let me "confess" something.

465
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:47,458
Like I just said, first,

466
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,298
I'm ignorant about the law.

467
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:52,766
So my lectures won't be of practical help

468
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:56,867
to law graduate students preparing for their bar exam.

469
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,567
"This question comes out frequently."

470
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,708
"This was from a mock exam. That was from a bar exam."

471
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:04,476
I won't be focusing on past exam questions.

472
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,977
All right.

473
00:35:06,778 --> 00:35:10,178
Get up and leave if you want.

474
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:14,487
Secondly,

475
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,858
I'm a feminist.

476
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:24,297
And according to the oldies' beliefs and logic,

477
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:27,367
I'm a communist.

478
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:33,507
Hence, I do not think the law and judges are sacred at all.

479
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:37,508
You're cool.

480
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:39,576
We still need fair laws for women,

481
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:43,617
the disabled, gender minorities, and the socially vulnerable.

482
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:47,417
No laws, no judges are sacred

483
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:50,057
and perfect.

484
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:58,498
Let me promise you one thing.

485
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:01,937
A way to think like a judicial officer.

486
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:05,507
In short, a way to think logically with a legal mindset.

487
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:07,668
As a law student myself,

488
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:12,008
I'll study and figure it out together with you during my class.

489
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:25,887
We talked about the conditions of punishment based on...

490
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:27,128
   

491
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,198
Focus!

492
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:40,108
Turn to page 138.

493
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,658
The issue regarding applying the accomplice rule.

494
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:47,777
This is from the bar exam in 2018 and the mock exams in 2013 and 2017.

495
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:52,416
A separate regulation is applied to each accomplice if necessary.

496
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,116
The accomplice rule

497
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:58,357
of the criminal law doesn't apply to inside accomplices.

498
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:01,128
This is important because...

499
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:09,068
What is he? A professor of Theater and Film?

500
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,837
We hold judges sacred for they enforce the law.

501
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:23,047
However, the realists in law say that the judiciary's decision

502
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:28,286
is a problem with what the judge had for breakfast.

503
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:32,258
In other words, if your sentencing

504
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:34,837
happens on the day the judge had a fight with his wife,

505
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:38,657
you're in bad luck.

506
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:53,147
Well, since there aren't any court cases yet,

507
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,516
- it's realistically impossible. 
 - Hello, Professor.

508
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,118
I'm Reporter Yoon Eun Mi from SBC, who called you—

509
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:58,616
Professor, can I have your autograph?

510
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:00,616
- Can I have your autograph, please? 
 - Wait.

511
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:01,516
Can I have your autograph?

512
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:04,557
Can I have your autograph, please?

513
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:13,228
Gosh.

514
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:15,196
Can I take a selfie with you?

515
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:18,436
- Can I have your autograph? 
 - I'm Reporter Yoon Eun Mi from SBC.

516
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,987
- Excuse me. 
 - I'm sorry.

517
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,306
I told you that I won't do individual interviews.

518
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:25,076
You're putting me in a difficult position if you come like this.

519
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:28,047
Please, I'm asking for just a moment of your time.

520
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,478
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:30,476
- Professor! 
 - What about the photo?

522
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,386
- You promised a selfie with us. 
 - Autograph, please.

523
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,417
Gosh.

524
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:38,387
Goodness.

525
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:43,277
 Then are you saying your wife has control over you? 

526
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,826
 No, it's not that she has control over me, 

527
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:48,498
 I want to live as a dependent variable. 

528
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:52,036
 Goddesses like Aphrodite and Athena have the right to be hailed. 

529
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,538
He said, "Aphrodite and Athena."

530
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:58,878
What kind of woman has control over a man like that?

531
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,348
- What is it to be controlled? 
 - Well...

532
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:04,317
Not even imagining being with another woman?

533
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:07,468
 I'll only look up to Professor Na Geun Woo. 

534
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:12,387
Class preparation is complete.

535
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,280
- Ah Jeong. 
 - Yes?

536
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:23,737
You know I trust you a lot, right?

537
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,367
Just tell me. What is it?

538
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,917
Shall I show you something interesting?

539
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,137
Something interesting?

540
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,747
I really trust you.

541
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,618
What is it?

542
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,347
This better be good.

543
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:56,128
He's being controlled by his wife?

544
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:09,410
♫  The sun is just a shining star, even if it goes round and round all day  ♫

545
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:20,080
♫  In the end, there is only one crown left  ♫

546
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,128
I watched the TV show.

547
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:30,258
You relate Hye Ryul to Aphrodite and Athena,

548
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,697
then what am I?

549
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:34,728
You're my muse.

550
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:36,498
Muse?

551
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:39,038
You're my Helen.

552
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:47,647
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

553
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:53,547
Remember. I can become Aegis and Hades.

554
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:56,848
Don't forget. I can become a shield,

555
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:01,008
but I can also be the demon that pulls you into the fire pit.

556
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:02,997
I won't forget it.

557
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,110
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

558
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:17,260
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

559
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:24,180
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

560
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:31,240
♫  We are burning on the tide  ♫

561
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:35,857
Eventually, for your own good,

562
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:41,298
your mother, your grandmother, and I made an effort.

563
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,937
It is the Lord's blessing to receive a talent.

564
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:49,677
It is evil and idle to just keep that talent.

565
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:54,277
You must win more talent with the talent you have.

566
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:56,617
Only then you can undertake great deeds.

567
00:42:56,617 --> 00:43:01,488
Only then, you could enjoy the Lord's joy together.

568
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:03,987
Chapter 25 of the Gospel of Matthew...

569
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:05,857
Honey.

570
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:10,028
It's late. Are you still studying the gospel?

571
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:15,598
Now, Kang Baek is better in the bible than I, and Kang Ye...

572
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:18,067
And for Kang Ye...

573
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,767
You should think about her complexion.

574
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,508
You know how important sleep is for a lady's complexion?

575
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:26,078
It is. Look how dry my skin is.

576
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:29,147
Your complexion is so much better than mine.

577
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,847
Is it? That could be right.

578
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:34,517
Gosh. Think about my age.

579
00:43:34,517 --> 00:43:39,057
How can I be compared to this high schooler with a young face. Gosh, you.

580
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:42,357
I really mean it, Great-grandma.

581
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,928
What about you Kang Baek? Are there any difficulties with your studies?

582
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:48,627
No. I'm okay.

583
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:54,066
He always gets a scholarship from Minguk University Law School where all the talented students gather.

584
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,337
Kang Baek, you're great.

585
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:59,278
The scholarship isn't the big deal.

586
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:01,408
Our Kang Baek is a natural.

587
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,778
When I saw his answers the other day,

588
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:05,888
he is the same as Hye Ryul when she was young.

589
00:44:05,888 --> 00:44:10,018
His logic is clear and never misses an issue.

590
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:12,758
Really?

591
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:17,457
Do you want to become a prosecutor like your mother after graduation?

592
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:22,497
- Well, I—
 - No. He should become a judge like me.

593
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:26,437
It's about time we have another Supreme Court Justice.

594
00:44:26,437 --> 00:44:30,408
Heaven can be compared to ten women going out to greet

595
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:34,648
their husbands, each holding a lamp.

596
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:38,678
Gosh.

597
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,697
She already left me the facial cream.

598
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,187
She did?

599
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:45,018
It wasn't something urgent.

600
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:49,458
She's always good at taking care of the family.

601
00:44:51,627 --> 00:44:54,398
I wonder if she really thinks of me as family.

602
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:57,267
Why? Did something happen?

603
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:00,767
Did Gwang Jeon make a mistake?

604
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:05,807
No, she didn't. It's been years since I came to this house,

605
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:09,418
but I feel like I'm treated like a guest. That's why.

606
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:15,278
It's nice that she takes care of me, but to this day, she has never discussed

607
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:17,487
household matters or even the dinner menu with me.

608
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:20,328
That's because I made sure it doesn't happen.

609
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:24,597
To never let my woman go through any complex matters.

610
00:45:27,198 --> 00:45:29,867
Thank you, honey.

611
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:31,698
Good.

612
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:33,067
Let's apply this together.

613
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,737
I'm okay. You go ahead and put it on.

614
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,878
Here.

615
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:41,677
Let's put some on your face...

616
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:44,548
and on your neck as well.

617
00:45:45,317 --> 00:45:48,087
And on your hands.

618
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,417
We should put some on your feet.

619
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,488
Goodness.

620
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:03,168
You came home late.

621
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:08,237
Course preparation took a long time.

622
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:10,638
I thought you don't have a class tomorrow.

623
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:16,517
I have this special lecture next week.

624
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:20,968
You look tired. You should go upstairs.

625
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,168
You're home.

626
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:40,508
It took a while.

627
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,936
You must be tired. Take a shower and rest.

628
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:44,277
Yes.

629
00:46:44,277 --> 00:46:45,978
Do you need to work?

630
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:48,848
Yes, I need to ask Mom something.

631
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,448
Okay.

632
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,377
Good night.

633
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:48,467
Here's your coffee.

634
00:48:00,248 --> 00:48:01,718
Nice.

635
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,087
Think about your health.

636
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,127
Mom.

637
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:11,927
If I don't do this, I'm going to lose my mind

638
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,567
or I have to kill someone.

639
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:26,777
A cat walked in.

640
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,678
Mom, take a look at this.

641
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:34,048
The seizure is giving me a headache.

642
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:36,417
According to the Supreme Court's decision,

643
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,817
the item for seizure, written in the warrant

644
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:42,298
issued by the judge, must be interpreted strictly.

645
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:44,727
We must not settle or make an analogical interpretation

646
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:48,098
that plays against the confiscated,

647
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:50,598
but if you look here...

648
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:52,467
   

649
00:48:52,468 --> 00:48:55,337
I've never been there before.

650
00:48:55,337 --> 00:48:57,778
I was home that day.

651
00:48:57,778 --> 00:49:00,507
How strange.

652
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:03,417
Joong Jin. He said he was never there.

653
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:05,348
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake in the investigation?

654
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:08,348
May 8th, 8 p.m.

655
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:11,997
The crosswalk in front of Jakjeon Station, Gyeyang-gu, Incheon.

656
00:49:11,997 --> 00:49:13,588
Were you there?

657
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:19,458
Oh, right. That day...

658
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,197
My friend suddenly wanted to go out for a drink.

659
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:24,136
I went to a bar nearby.

660
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:25,397
Who's that friend?

661
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:28,068
May we call him?

662
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:31,877
We had a fight that day and decided never to meet again.

663
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:35,477
- What about payment? 
 - Payment?

664
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:38,478
He paid for everything.

665
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:51,698
A lie...

666
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,398
is like a living thing.

667
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:57,297
Once you feed it,

668
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:59,206
it sees its chance

669
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:03,708
and sucks the blood out of you...

670
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:09,948
until you die. It's that gross.

671
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,117
Your ex-wife's brother,

672
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:18,516
we've confirmed

673
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:21,558
his bank account as well.

674
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:25,528
I...

675
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:28,067
I'm hungry.

676
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,967
I'll tell you after some food.

677
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:33,667
What a wise decision.

678
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,866
Joong Jin.

679
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:37,476
Get him extra large ox bone soup.

680
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:40,008
Extra large ox bone soup it is.

681
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:43,647
Let's wrap it up after the meal.

682
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:46,848
Get me one too!

683
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:51,537
Get me extra large ox bone soup.

684
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:53,888
What brings you here?

685
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,127
It's been years since you graduated from college.

686
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,397
Why do you still come to me asking for food?

687
00:50:58,398 --> 00:51:00,426
If you want a free meal,

688
00:51:00,426 --> 00:51:02,867
go meet your successful seniors.

689
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:04,197
Don't you know how much I get?

690
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:07,737
Don't be like that, I need comfort.

691
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:10,878
I got scolded big time after getting rejected today.

692
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:15,648
Then go home and enjoy your parents' hearty meal.

693
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:18,016
Why are you looking for ox bone soup here?

694
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:21,247
I already have a lot on my mind.

695
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:23,258
Get lost.

696
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,658
How can you say that to a reporter?

697
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:30,558
You'll regret kicking me out.

698
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:34,228
I brought solid information.

699
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:38,667
What's that?

700
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:43,377
You said it's solid.

701
00:51:43,378 --> 00:51:45,077
Come on.

702
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:48,147
Can't you trust people?

703
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,976
It's not that I can't trust people,

704
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:52,047
but you aren't exactly reliable.

705
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,147
Show me what you have first.

706
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,687
The presidential candidate preference survey result is out.

707
00:51:57,687 --> 00:52:00,156
Na Geun Woo is clawing his way up.

708
00:52:00,156 --> 00:52:02,328
Very fast.

709
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,727
- Is that all? 
 - No way.

710
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:06,927
There's a new person.

711
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:09,998
- A new person? 
 - It's unbelievable.

712
00:52:09,998 --> 00:52:11,136
It must've bothered him so much.

713
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:12,237
They're having an internal investigation.

714
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:15,488
They want to root her out before she gets any bigger.

715
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:19,158
- Internal investigation? 
 - Police Intelligence Agency.

716
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:21,207
Who is it?

717
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:23,476
I thought it was all for show when she said she was going after Jusung,

718
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,827
but this must've been what they were after.

719
00:52:26,548 --> 00:52:28,447
Na Geun Woo's wife,

720
00:52:30,557 --> 00:52:32,087
Han Hye Ryul.

721
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:17,120


722
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:30,160
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

723
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,747
   

724
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,500
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

725
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,540
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

726
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,680
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

727
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,530
♫  It's a game of the tongue  ♫

728
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:00,690
♫  My heart is already on the floor  ♫

729
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:06,800
♫  Who will laugh at the end?  ♫

730
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,440
♫  On the shoulders of the giants  ♫

731
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,080
♫  Like a blooming flower  ♫

732
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:18,516
   

733
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:20,758
 We will subpoena the vice chairman. 

734
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:22,587
 Han Hye Ryul, that wench! 

735
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,826
 They're still my in-laws. What will that make of Hye Ryul? 

736
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:26,827
 It's Hye Ryul's job! 

737
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:29,268
 I guess she is one fierce woman indeed. 

738
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:30,636
 So you're not going to let this go. 

739
00:55:30,637 --> 00:55:33,967
 Don't tell me that you have the slightest hope that you will be the president. Is that it? 

740
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:36,107
 Could there be any info about Han Hye Ryul? 

741
00:55:36,108 --> 00:55:40,107
 How's the Christmas Fund going? 

742
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:41,246
 Knock it out. 

743
00:55:41,247 --> 00:55:43,647
 I think they are exclusively digging on "A" meeting "B". 

744
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:44,947
 Who is that? 

745
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:46,948
 You love me, right?
