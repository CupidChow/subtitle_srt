1
00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:02,733
   

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:54,060



3
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:04,363
I would like to congratulate you on getting accepted 
    

4
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,533
into the best law school in Korea. 
    

5
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:13,733
Your intelligence and hard work have brought you here,

6
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:16,343
and you have now also become the chosen ones

7
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,114
to gloriously live your lives as law officers.

8
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:23,614
I always share a short saying, which is my life motto,

9
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:29,224
during my entrance ceremony speech every year.

10
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:35,423
Everyone, I just said it was a short saying.

11
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:37,744
You should clap when you hear things like that.

12
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:47,343
You're watching one's ability

13
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:52,843
to become brazen, which is the most important quality for lawyers.

14
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:01,723
Rudolf von Jhering, who published "The Struggle for Law," said this.

15
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,494
"One person has been obliged to battle and to labor

16
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:06,294
for another who enjoys and lives in peace."

17
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:10,293
Everyone, I'll be straightforward.

18
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:13,063
Will you live to battle and to labor?

19
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:17,074
Or do you want to live in peace?

20
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:21,413
Based on how you spend your days at this school,

21
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:25,383
you will be either obliged to battle or live in peace.

22
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:27,114
Don't get carried away by getting into this law school.

23
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,214
You must stay on your toes.

24
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,954
There are 30,000 lawyers in Korea.

25
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:35,954
Getting a lawyer license will not give you a comfortable life!

26
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:39,363
The director definitely has a presence.

27
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,663
I'm going to study really hard.

28
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,663
The speech was disappointing, and she totally misinterpreted the line.

29
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,563
My cousin who took the bar exam told me.

30
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:50,103
Jhering said that the purpose of the law is to bring peace,

31
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,644
and the means to attain peace is to battle and labor.

32
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:54,543
The life of the law is to battle.

33
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,913
Battling to bring forth the law...

34
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,883
- Kang Baek. Excuse me. 
 - ...is not a curse but a blessing.

35
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,154
"One person has been obliged to battle and to labor

36
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:04,084
for another who enjoys and lives in peace."

37
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,854
It means you should not forget that the peace you enjoy now came from someone's sacrifice,

38
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,994
and it encourages you not to stop working hard to walk the right path.

39
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:13,763
Why are you going that deep?

40
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,293
Just let it go.

41
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:18,404
She just wants us to study hard. That's a good message.

42
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,333
If I don't pass the bar exam... Goodness.

43
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,903
That will turn our peaceful life into a battlefield for sure.

44
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,844
Other people are living on a battlefield,

45
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:28,414
but can we say that there's peace just because your life is at peace?

46
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,744
Law officers are the last people to think so.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,614
Sure. That's peace to me.

48
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,054
Attending law school is a way out of the proletariat,

49
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:39,004
and it's the only ladder that will bring me to the bourgeoisie.

50
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,953
- Mr. Revolutionist. 
 - Sorry, Kang Baek.

51
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:48,724
- Let's go and get some food. 
 - Starting this semester, I'm going to get a tutoring class from a lawyer.

52
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:51,663
If you want, you can join me.

53
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,943
What? Did you hear that?

54
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,513
Yes.

55
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:13,153
Back then, I didn't know she was your grandmother.

56
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,554
Sorry.

57
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,524
Don't be. I thought you were right.

58
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,033
You weren't upset?

59
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,063
So tell me.

60
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,233
You said the life of the law is to fight, Mr. Officer of the Law.

61
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,103
What didn't you understand?

62
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,773
Well, churches are unincorporated.

63
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,614
According to Article 275 of the Civil Law,

64
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:40,444
the assets of the churches belong to the members. I understood that part

65
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:45,253
but it confuses me when a church divides into two churches.

66
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,153
Then the Civil Law only considers this

67
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,424
as breaking away as a group or remaining in the original group.

68
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:52,474
Does it mean we can't consider this as a division of...

69
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,530
Guys, I brought... coffee.

70
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,804
I knew this would happen at some point.

71
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:34,833
Hey, I understand that you guys are young and all.

72
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,744
You guys can't kiss in this sacred study room!

73
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:41,303
- Nan Hee. 
 - Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

74
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,414
You guys should be careful not to get caught.

75
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:49,084
I'll tell you a spot where you will never get caught kissing.

76
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,833
   

77
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,284
You should let your eyes rest from time to time.

78
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,254
You're reading on your days off too.

79
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,153
Gosh. I'm not scolding you or anything.

80
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:34,293
I'm just worried that you might read books all night.

81
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,193
"Maurice?"

82
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:39,003
That's a great book, and he was an excellent writer too.

83
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,303
Did you enjoy the book?

84
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:41,804
Yes,

85
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:45,244
but I couldn't read it again because it was heartbreaking.

86
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:47,943
But this book has a happy ending.

87
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:51,143
Well, it wasn't just about the plot.

88
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:56,184
Living as a homosexual must have been painful and lonely,

89
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,424
and thinking that he was only able to share his love through a novel

90
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:06,223
he couldn't publish when he was alive made me sad and pity him.

91
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,363
You pity him.

92
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,703
It really makes me so proud that you're always showing

93
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:18,173
interest in the socially weak.

94
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:22,074
You will be a much better law officer than me.

95
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:25,013
I don't think I can be.

96
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,954
No. I believe in you

97
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,813
with all of my heart.

98
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,354
Wrap up your reading and come to the dining room.

99
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,484
Let's have lunch.

100
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:39,564
Oh, don't let your grandpa see you reading this.

101
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,023
You know how he is, right?

102
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:45,134
He is going to throw a fit if he catches you reading this.

103
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,934
Don't take too long.

104
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:53,204
   

105
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:00,013
My beloved members,

106
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,714
no one is born homosexual.

107
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,854
Homosexuality is an acquired preference.

108
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,553
They either got addicted after watching gay porn

109
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,624
or were sexually aroused when they were kids.

110
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,064
That's when people become homosexuals.

111
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:19,334
In the Bible, homosexuality is considered an abominable sin,

112
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:22,774
and it says that they will be stoned to death.

113
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,944
However, in the Bible, as long as one repents from their sins

114
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:30,614
and decides to turn over a new leaf, everyone can be forgiven.

115
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,143
Take the sinner in Luke for example.

116
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:35,914
- When she asked Jesus for forgiveness... 
 - Are you all right?

117
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,354
He answered her with love, not punishment.

118
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,423
Yes.

119
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,523
Even if you committed the grave sin of homosexuality,

120
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,594
as long as you repent and come back to the arms of Jesus,

121
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,494
everyone including prodigals, murderers, and homosexuals

122
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:51,333
can be embraced with love.

123
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,604
That's the Christian way to live.

124
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,520
- Amen! 
 - Amen!

125
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,104
Amen.

126
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,444
A sin that will bring death.

127
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:01,913
Verse 13, Chapter 20 of Leviticus.

128
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:05,744
"If a man lies with a male, as with a woman,

129
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,854
both of them have committed an abomination.

130
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,714
They shall surely be put to death.

131
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:14,083
Their blood shall be upon themselves."

132
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,464
Leave.

133
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,893
Don't ever come back.

134
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,294
- Kang Baek. 
 - Leave.

135
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,334
It's over.

136
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:27,464
It's all over now.

137
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,703
- Don't do this. 
 - No! You stop this!

138
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:40,773
Just punch it with your hand.

139
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,214
It's nice. Isn't it?

140
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,240
We can make it as big as a face.

141
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,280
Right.

142
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,184
Make Italian food since we're having a visitor.

143
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:57,324
Well, Ms. Ham said she wanted us to make octopus gourd soup

144
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:02,263
and hot pot rice with pine mushrooms for dinner.

145
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,064
No. Actually, we received some excellent shrimps.

146
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:10,873
I will make bisque pasta and a pine mushroom appetizer.

147
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,304
You can make fresh pasta, right?

148
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:17,474
I don't have enough time to age it but I'll do my best.

149
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,413
Please tell the visitor that dinner is at 7 p.m.

150
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,610
- Sure. 
 - There's no need.

151
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:27,824
If you're talking about Kyung Yoon, he just left.

152
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,954
Already?

153
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,023
They have exams coming up soon. He came by just to say hello.

154
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:35,733
Kang Baek hasn't eaten anything lately.

155
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,403
I chose the menu for dinner without talking to you first.

156
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:40,564
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:44,334
Let's have Italian food for dinner as she suggested.

158
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,204
- Okay. 
 - That's fine.

159
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,873
I only told them to change it because the last time he was here,

160
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,584
he seemed to like pasta.

161
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:54,383
I would like some Korean food for tonight's dinner too.

162
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:58,353
You should prepare healthy meals Kang Baek likes for now.

163
00:11:58,353 --> 00:12:00,653
Yes, I will do that.

164
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,653
Thank you.

165
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,194
I'll come down when dinner is ready.

166
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,573
Should I prepare a cup of tea in your study?

167
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,344
No.

168
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,854
I need to pray.

169
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:35,654
I must pray.

170
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,363
"When you pray, go into your room, close the door,

171
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,463
and pray to your Father who is unseen.

172
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,134
Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you."

173
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,604
"Do not be like them,

174
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,914
for your Father knows what you need

175
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:02,613
before you ask him."

176
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,664
 Hello. How may I help you? 

177
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:51,564
 I want to buy a birthday gift. 

178
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,104
 Is that for your girlfriend? 

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,803
 Yes. 

180
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,273
 This is the most popular piece this season. 

181
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,570
 It's a platinum— 

182
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,370
 This kind of design isn't... 

183
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,864
 Do you have one in a simple design? 

184
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,253
 Well, if you don't have couples' rings yet, how about a ring? 

185
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,553
 Pardon? 

186
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,194
 Oh... 

187
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,164
 The design is the same for both men and women, 

188
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:25,003
 and it won't be uncomfortable to wear it in your day-to-day life. 

189
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:27,763
 As it feels comfortable, many couples buy them for their wedding bands. 

190
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,533
 You can get them engraved without charge within the first month of your purchase. 

191
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,773
 I'll take them. 

192
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:36,344
 Okay. Do you know your girlfriend's ring size? 

193
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,773
 Well... 

194
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,913
 I don't. 

195
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,304
 I think the size might be about the same 

196
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,123
 or slightly bigger. 

197
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,194
 Then could you bring her here next time? 

198
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:52,094
 No. I can't do that. 

199
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:55,764
 I see. This is a surprise. 

200
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:56,633
 Yes. 

201
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:00,603
 You can exchange it for a different size within two weeks of your purchase. 

202
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:02,934
 I'll prepare a size bigger than yours, 

203
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,574
 so she can try it on first. 

204
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,704
 If it doesn't fit her, you can get it exchanged. How about that? 

205
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,674
 Sure. I'll do that. 

206
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,974
 I'll make sure the wrapping is done nicely. 

207
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:15,313
 I'm so envious of your girlfriend. 

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,430
♫   A friend's voice   ♫

209
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:32,950
♫   from afar   ♫

210
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:40,970
♫   Will the turning train wheels   ♫

211
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,910
♫   answer?  ♫

212
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:51,554
   

213
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,783
   

214
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:55,553
You made it obvious that this was a targeted investigation

215
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:58,324
but you had to release the suspect before the 48 hours were up.

216
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,294
This time, you failed to file for an arrest warrant after the immediate arrest,

217
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,194
so the evidence won't be admissible?

218
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:07,433
- I'm sorry. 
 - An apology won't make this go away!

219
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,304
Without an arrest warrant,

220
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:12,204
even if there was consent, the evidence is obtained illegally.

221
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,904
We can't use any of the evidence from the cell phone!

222
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:17,313
How will you fix this?

223
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,783
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,513
We have no choice now.

225
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:25,024
Only charge him with animal abuse, and drop the other charges.

226
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,124
Let go of the other charges.

227
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,554
- Sir! 
 - Listen carefully.

228
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,964
I'm trying to clean up your mess.

229
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:35,964
You guys blew all the other charges like stalking and illegal filming!

230
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,404
The victim is dead,

231
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:42,774
and I don't want this case to get more attention.

232
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:46,843
This is very good news for you guys.

233
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:52,614
Starting now, you need to lie low and go along with the flow.

234
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,314
Okay?

235
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,483
There will be a disciplinary hearing,

236
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,223
so prepare for that.

237
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,573
A disciplinary hearing?

238
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,053
Wait. Him too?

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,863
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,933
It's my fault.

241
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:20,473
Gosh. It's partially my fault too.

242
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,114
You didn't do anything wrong.

243
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,084
It makes me wonder if our mistake is that bad.

244
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,614
His lawyer just happens to be really good.

245
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:30,953
We were doing what everyone else was doing.

246
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,884
It was wrong that we did it because everyone was doing it.

247
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:36,753
We often make that excuse when we don't want

248
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:40,723
to be responsible for breaking the protocol for minor things.

249
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:44,093
The world has changed, but we stuck to our old ways of doing things.

250
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,533
That's our wrongdoing.

251
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,604
Sorry.

252
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:48,933
We should catch the culprit.

253
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,643
It's all good as long as we catch the culprit. Okay?

254
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,513
Gosh. I thought I was going down for this. 
    

255
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:07,354
Look at this. I was just trying to get on the good side

256
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,794
of the prosecutors and the Blue House. Darn it.

257
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:13,223
They can't come to an agreement, so I'm in a tight spot in between.

258
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:16,493
At times like this, I should just play dumb.

259
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,343
There's nothing I can do.

260
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,633
Goodness.

261
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:26,104
Do you think the culprit of this case will be caught?

262
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,854
When there are so many people hoping that won't be the case?

263
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,074
I'm surprised that you wanted to see me in private.

264
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:50,794
It makes me wonder if I have become an important person now.

265
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:55,733
You are very close to Hye Ryul

266
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,973
and my ex-son-in-law,

267
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:01,274
so it never occurred to me that we should meet in private.

268
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,843
I hope you won't be offended by that.

269
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,543
After all, we will soon be in-laws.

270
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,754
"In-laws?"

271
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,084
Yes.

272
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,193
Ever since Ji Yi was young, it was you who always said

273
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:20,423
that you wanted her to marry my grandson.

274
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,693
Right,

275
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,593
but...

276
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,304
my daughter is only 25 years old.

277
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,673
She is just tall.

278
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:33,943
She is still a little kid.

279
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:35,973
I know

280
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:39,113
what's stopping you.

281
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:43,954
You must want to find the best husband for your precious only daughter.

282
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,484
Isn't that how you feel?

283
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:51,864
If she marries Kang Baek now, it won't be easy for the time being.

284
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:55,863
Right. She is like a delicate little flower.

285
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,593
She was coddled all her life.

286
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,534
While raising her, I never wanted her

287
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,473
to experience any unpleasant feelings like sadness and pain.

288
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:06,344
So if things get even just a little stressful, she can't take it.

289
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:10,614
Do you remember Moo Ryul's wedding?

290
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:11,913
You came to her wedding.

291
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,413
Of course, I remember. It was such a grand wedding.

292
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:19,184
It was just a year after Jusung's first search and seizure

293
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,283
since its establishment.

294
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,353
Was it?

295
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,323
Oh, right.

296
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:31,034
It was the talk of the town for a while.

297
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,763
Jung Chan Young was the head of the Special Department.

298
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:37,134
Looking back now, I don't know how he had the nerve to do such a thing.

299
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,574
He is not that gutsy.

300
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,913
He started his own firm after that. I hear it's doing very well.

301
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:43,714
Yes, it's doing really well.

302
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:48,944
Rumor has it that he earned more than 200,000 dollars in just three years,

303
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,183
then there are people like me who get a civil service salary,

304
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:54,733
even when they work themselves to the bone.

305
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,653
When I think about that,

306
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,763
it makes me sad that I have this job.

307
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,694
That being said,

308
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:06,663
I'm thinking I could help you become brave,

309
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:10,403
like Jung Chan Young.

310
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,533
What do you say?

311
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,213
Pardon me?

312
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:19,114
Whether it's a defense counsel made up of big-firm lawyers

313
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,814
or an in-house legal team,

314
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,783
it's all useless unless it's your own family.

315
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,724
Jusung finally realized it.

316
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:31,793
That's why they initiated the marriage talk with my family,

317
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:35,794
not some influential politician or business leader's family.

318
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,533
The tip-off Jung Chan Young received...

319
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,190
By any chance, was it...

320
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,400
No.

321
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,344
"I should just admit to giving the tip-off."

322
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,483
It's better to use that to have leverage.

323
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,753
I hear you wish to get into politics.

324
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:06,293
How much longer will you walk on eggshells around everyone and wait?

325
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:12,394
I can help you make it happen with this.

326
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,974
Can you think of anyone who can look into the secret?

327
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,043
Well...

328
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,140
That's...

329
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,940
You see,

330
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,884
this is the kind of family you're marrying Ji Yi off to.

331
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:34,624
The reason Gun Do has never gotten into trouble

332
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:37,453
despite all his frivolous antics.

333
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,664
Now, you know why.

334
00:22:58,614 --> 00:22:59,615
   

335
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:00,843
   

336
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:14,664
The call can't be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

337
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,174
   

338
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,184
   

339
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:40,984
 You're drunk. 

340
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:46,623
 Not enough to not understand what this means. 

341
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,763
 Are you sure? 

342
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:56,403
 Kang Baek 

343
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,133
 doesn't even care about me now. 

344
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:02,704
 My friend, who I confided in, is blackmailing me, 

345
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:05,443
 and to be honest, I'm falling behind in class. 

346
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,213
 My parents fight every day because I'm a failure. 

347
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:14,124
 - Ji Yi. 
 - I don't even know what I'm doing here. 

348
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:17,294
 Why am I holding out? What for? 

349
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:20,023
 I'm really exhausted. 

350
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,763
 I just want... 

351
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,243
 to forget about everything 

352
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:29,833
 for just one night. 

353
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:37,874
 Does this have to mean something? 

354
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,953
 Get some sleep. 

355
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:54,254
 It's dangerous to drive at this hour. 

356
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:56,153
 Kyung Yoon won't be back until around lunchtime. 

357
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,794
 If someone sees me, that will be more dangerous. 

358
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:00,224
 And... 

359
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:04,664
 I'm sorry. This won't happen again. 

360
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,374
 Then let me walk you to the parking lot, at least. 

361
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,674
 It gets really dark here at night. 

362
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:29,654
   

363
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,533
Ji Yi.

364
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,613
- Let's talk. 
 - My answer is no.

365
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:52,584
What?

366
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:56,014
Your proposal. My answer is no.

367
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,014
I won't go to you.

368
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:01,823
I don't want to have to apologize to both of you anymore.

369
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:16,364
If you happen to see Kyung Yoon, can you tell him to call me?

370
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:19,843
He is not coming to class, and I can't reach him.

371
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,443
Why? Because of Kang Baek?

372
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:24,743
Are you afraid he will tell Kang Baek about that day?

373
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,514
If that's what this is about, don't worry.

374
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,083
I know that Kyung Yoon is discreet,

375
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,983
- but I feel anxious. 
 - No, that's not what I meant.

376
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,854
Kang Baek...

377
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:41,524
doesn't care who you sleep with, so you don't need to worry.

378
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:43,834
He doesn't love you.

379
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:49,503
- Stop. 
 - He never loved you

380
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,403
and never will.

381
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,243
I told you to stop!

382
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:56,773
I know that too, so stop!

383
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:00,283
I love him, and that's all that matters!

384
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:04,654
I'll just love him more to make up for it!

385
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,884
That's enough!

386
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,524
That will do!

387
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,094
Ji Yi.

388
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:23,703
I thought that would be enough too.

389
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,173
Turns out, it's not.

390
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:31,023
It doesn't work that way.

391
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,223
Kang Baek's friend stopped by while you were out.

392
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,493
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

393
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:50,663
Thanks to the visit, Kang Baek seemed to be in a better mood

394
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,664
but he went back to his room.

395
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,333
Don't worry too much. Everything will get sorted out soon.

396
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:59,174
- Really? 
 - Wait and see.

397
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:03,543
Oh, right. I forgot.

398
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,174
So it's not Yoon Gu Ryeong.

399
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,274
You sure heard that fast.

400
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,344
Even in this office, only a few people know.

401
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,654
Oh, please. It's what got me this far.

402
00:29:44,654 --> 00:29:47,683
So clearly, you came here with a goal today.

403
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:53,893
I'd like to achieve my goal, but the thing is,

404
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:58,193
I do not know how much you love your son.

405
00:29:58,193 --> 00:30:00,703
In other words,

406
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:04,003
it depends on what and how much I'm willing to do

407
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:07,744
for Kang Baek?

408
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:11,073
That's right. This time, the stakes are high.

409
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:15,213
I'm here to ask you for a favor that requires

410
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,413
strong determination.

411
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,854
You say it's not easy, straight up?

412
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,794
What a new approach.

413
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:26,963
The reward is worth it.

414
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:29,793
A murder case

415
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:33,133
is not closed until the culprit is captured.

416
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,763
The culprit,

417
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,504
I will give it to you.

418
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:44,673
All ready and set up just for you.

419
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:48,743
What are you saying?

420
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,584
I'm saying I'll make it look like an ordinary murder case.

421
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,654
For Kang Baek

422
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,594
to escape clean.

423
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:05,393
   

424
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:09,963
I don't know what you heard,

425
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:13,904
but Kang Baek didn't do it.

426
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:18,473
You've met him before.

427
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:23,243
- He wouldn't... 
 - You're right. Kang Baek isn't the culprit.

428
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:28,053
The culprit I'm giving you

429
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:32,854
is the guy who killed Hong Nan Hee.

430
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:40,704
Prosecutor Ko.

431
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,803
I mean, does the truth matter now?

432
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:09,663
Suspend the execution of Dolphin's sentence

433
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,583
for about three months.

434
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,264
I'm sure you'll come up with a good reason for it.

435
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,903
He said his body aches these days.

436
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:20,753
Suspension of execution for only the ones with late-stage cancer?

437
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:23,444
You're right. It's not easy.

438
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,574
Please hurry.

439
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:30,114
The procedure is complex, and you'll need Mr. Jang's approval.

440
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,653
He wants the payment in advance.

441
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:36,124
He said he was backstabbed by prosecutors many times before.

442
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:39,323
What are you getting in return?

443
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:48,534
You care about what I'm getting?

444
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,634
How delicate of you.

445
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:55,073
I might as well answer since you asked.

446
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,144
I'm planning to go independent.

447
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,584
It's been a while since I walked the prison wall. 
  (T/N: Crossing back and forth between the line of legality) 

448
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:08,024
I got sick of watching others making money when I did all the work.

449
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:11,524
Mr. Han will be disappointed.

450
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:15,163
I'm not sure if he'll be disappointed

451
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:17,623
or if he'll want to kill me.

452
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,073
 The call can't be connected... 

453
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:45,453
   

454
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:52,194
I thought only special intimidation didn't apply.

455
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:56,104
Evidence for stalking and illegal filming must be in the phone.

456
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,473
We made a mistake.

457
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,944
We couldn't unlock the phone.

458
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:02,743
Even if we did it, it was inadmissible.

459
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:04,743
We can't use it anymore.

460
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,443
I'm ashamed.

461
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:09,013
Geez.

462
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:14,004
You came to my house on my day off, and that's what you say?

463
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:15,924
What about that punk?

464
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:17,593
Is it over now?

465
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:22,064
If he passes the bar exam, he becomes a lawyer, doesn't he?

466
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,963
I'm sorry.

467
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,813
Hong Nan Hee is dead.

468
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:41,843
She can't do or become what she wanted,

469
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,584
but the murderer's better off?

470
00:34:46,223 --> 00:34:48,023
How...

471
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,924
How is that possible?

472
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:56,893
Yoon Gu Ryeong didn't kill Hong Nan Hee.

473
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,263
According to NFS' result, the iron pipe he was holding

474
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:03,234
had cats' blood. In fact, a lot of blood.

475
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,234
Multiple cats.

476
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,474
So?

477
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:10,174
Meaning he used the same iron pipe,

478
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,214
but he would change the weapon just for the murder?

479
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:15,614
That's awkward.

480
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,884
Conclusively,

481
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:22,123
he's left-handed.

482
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:39,234
The culprit is right-handed.

483
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:42,574
There are many who are right-handed.

484
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,843
So who's the culprit?

485
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,314
 The call can't be connected... 

486
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:54,624
   

487
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:12,004
Mr. Oh!

488
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,843
What?

489
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:16,944
Is there a problem with the warrant application?

490
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:20,684
No, that's been done meticulously.

491
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:23,683
I just heard about this.

492
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,714
- Hye Ryul. 
 - Yes.

493
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,593
About Yoon Gu Ryeong...

494
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,854
 He'll be prosecuted for animal abuse, what he got caught red-handed on. 

495
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:08,263
 He won't be charged for the rest. 

496
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,134
 His phone is important, 

497
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:13,663
 but it became inadmissible. Nothing more can be done. 

498
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:16,533
 By the way, making the cellphone inadmissible evidence 

499
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:20,044
 because it contains no scene of the accident, 

500
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:23,113
 isn't that Professor Na's field of study? 

501
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:25,174
   

502
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,904
Ladies and gentlemen.

503
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:40,024
Are animals objects?

504
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,593
If they are, why is that?

505
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:47,203
If they aren't objects, what's the reason?

506
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:49,234
Anyone?

507
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:01,564
Law students who argue that animals are objects,

508
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:05,854
often claim harming others' animals

509
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:07,984
should be considered property damage.

510
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:10,593
   

511
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:20,593
Come on. Answer the phone!

512
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:23,234
Answer it!

513
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,374
   

514
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:42,154
   

515
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,964
   

516
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:52,263
Are you okay?

517
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,563
Prosecutor Han!

518
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:57,033
Ah Jeong? Are you okay?

519
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,203
- Yes. 
 - Are you hurt?

520
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,504
- Get up. 
 - I fell from shock.

521
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,174
I'm sorry.

522
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,013
Are you okay?

523
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:05,674
Are you hurt?

524
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:06,743
No, I'm fine.

525
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,913
My goodness. I'm really sorry.

526
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:13,553
Give me your phone number just in case.

527
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:16,954
- I'm really okay. 
 - Still.

528
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,364
Wait. I'm sorry.

529
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:26,433
   

530
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:32,134
Here.

531
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:34,343
I'm really sorry, Ah Jeong.

532
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,013
No, I wasn't paying attention.

533
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:38,673
   

534
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:44,913
   

535
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,223
   

536
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,524
Are you getting a call?

537
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:53,024
Yes.

538
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:57,194
If you feel pain later, make sure to call me, okay?

539
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,794
Yes.

540
00:39:58,794 --> 00:39:59,904
- Prosecutor Han. 
 - Yes?

541
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:03,734
Was that Professor Na who called?

542
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:06,534
Yes.

543
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,773
Are you here to meet Professor Na?

544
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,214
Yes. I should get going.

545
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:15,643
- Take care. 
 - Yes.

546
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:19,083
Prosecutor Han!

547
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:22,784
You love

548
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,093
Kang Baek more than him, right?

549
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,363
You'd do anything for Kang Baek, right?

550
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:31,734
That's what parents do.

551
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:37,303
What are you trying to say?

552
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:40,304
Nan Hee...

553
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:43,343
Professor Na killed her.

554
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:50,954
Nan Hee was seeing Professor Na,

555
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:53,183
not Kang Baek.

556
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,794
   

557
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,933
 Are you happy that I'm gone? 

558
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,734
 Are you happy that I'm dead? 

559
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:10,174
   

560
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:13,904
   

561
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:41,233
 Yoon Gu Ryeong knew it too. 

562
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:44,933
 Even that they had a fight that day. 

563
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:49,143
I wondered if I should tell the police,

564
00:41:50,013 --> 00:41:51,774
but I couldn't.

565
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:55,074
I couldn't make Kang Baek the son of a murderer.

566
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:58,043
I didn't think he'd be able to bear with it.

567
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,234
I wanted Professor Na to turn himself in.

568
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:05,023
That's why I posted the picture online.

569
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:09,564
What picture?

570
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:12,343
The pictures of Nan Hee and Professor Na

571
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,163
lying in bed together.

572
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,503
It was wrong of me.

573
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:24,144
I had no idea people would gossip about Nan Hee so much.

574
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:26,674
That Professor Na would feign ignorance,

575
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:30,143
and even defend Yoon Gu Ryeong.

576
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:35,584
You'll protect Kang Baek no matter what happens, right?

577
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:38,573
Even if you have to give up on someone,

578
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:43,593
you are the only one

579
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:46,234
who can put an end to this.

580
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:12,524
Hye Ryul.

581
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,534
What is it?

582
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,833
Honey.

583
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:26,234
Just what is it?

584
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:31,014
What's wrong?

585
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:34,614
Do you

586
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,514
love Kang Baek?

587
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,554
Of course, I do.

588
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:42,354
He is our son.

589
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,493
Even if we get divorced?

590
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,333
Yes, even if...

591
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,164
Even if we get divorced,

592
00:43:56,504 --> 00:43:59,973
he'll still be my son. Forever.

593
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:04,513
Then why did you do it?

594
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,243
Yoon Gu Ryeong

595
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:10,083
will be free of suspicion now, thanks to you.

596
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:14,654
Without a post-warrant, one's phone can't be used as evidence.

597
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:16,823
You know that.

598
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:21,924
You knew, but you still bailed Yoon Gu Ryeong out to save yourself.

599
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:26,733
While Kang Baek was struggling in the gutter,

600
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,734
you did that to save yourself!

601
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,274
That's not it.

602
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:33,634
If you had truly considered him as your son,

603
00:44:33,634 --> 00:44:36,004
could you have done that?

604
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:39,773
A parent

605
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:42,843
is willing to sacrifice themselves for their child,

606
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:45,784
but what you said was all a lie!

607
00:44:47,524 --> 00:44:51,254
When you said you loved me, it was a lie.

608
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:54,794
When you said Kang Baek was your son,

609
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:59,173
and that you cared for him more than anyone else, it was all...

610
00:44:59,173 --> 00:45:01,363
No.

611
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:04,534
I know it's shameless of me,

612
00:45:05,473 --> 00:45:07,743
but I meant it all.

613
00:45:07,743 --> 00:45:09,743
I never...

614
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:14,743
My mom, Moo Ryul, Yoon Gu Ryeong, and Lee Ah Jeong.

615
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,813
They all know.

616
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:20,054
Ah Jeong

617
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:23,584
waited for you to turn yourself in.

618
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:29,863
She just couldn't make Kang Baek a murderer's son!

619
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:33,464
You care less about him than his friend does,

620
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,764
and do you possibly think you have the right to be his father?

621
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,933
How dare you say

622
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:46,614
that you love him and that he is your son?

623
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,943
Honey.

624
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,824
You don't think that's true, do you?

625
00:45:56,824 --> 00:46:01,363
- I didn't— 
 - Why didn't you just have an affair with a random woman?

626
00:46:01,363 --> 00:46:03,363
Then Kang Baek's friend wouldn't have come up to me

627
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:06,563
and told me about your affair!

628
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:11,373
You shouldn't have let anyone know in the first place!

629
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:16,774
Then... Then you wouldn't have had to defend Yoon Gu Ryeong,

630
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,183
nor would you have had to feel humiliated

631
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:23,183
to face my mom and sister!

632
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:27,984
I'm really sorry.

633
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:32,223
I'm sorry even to apologize.

634
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,993
Kang Baek knows.

635
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,334
What?

636
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:43,004
He knows about you and Hong Nan Hee!

637
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:45,433
He knows all about it.

638
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:10,263
- I'm done. 
 - Eat some more.

639
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:12,464
I prepared this dinner with care.

640
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,533
I'm afraid I'll have indigestion.

641
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:15,834
Even so.

642
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:19,834
Let him do as he wants. He's not a little kid.

643
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:22,973
I'll go upstairs.

644
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:26,884
Since you're not a little child, start going to school again

645
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:29,644
and proceed with your marriage with Ji Yi.

646
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:34,183
If a wedding feels too much, get engaged first.

647
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:35,283
Father.

648
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:40,693
He's old enough to know what's right.

649
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:44,564
Yes, I better do what's right.

650
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:48,134
I'll be going. Excuse me.

651
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,973
Honey.

652
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:56,573
I can't watch him stuck in his room anymore.

653
00:47:56,573 --> 00:48:01,444
He should know when to get over it and move on.

654
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,934
I love the scent. Pine mushrooms are already in season.

655
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:10,124
By the way, is Jang Il even willing to marry Ji Yi off to our family?

656
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:12,754
He's hardly in touch with me these days.

657
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:14,394
He is definitely trying to spare his bones.

658
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:18,694
He has made it to be the head of the Central District Office.

659
00:48:18,694 --> 00:48:20,703
It's not that he is trying to spare his bones.

660
00:48:20,703 --> 00:48:23,064
He just has a lot of options in mind.

661
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:26,274
Honey, don't be too harsh on Kang Baek.

662
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:28,374
He must be going through the worst.

663
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:32,913
Let's leave him be and keep him safe for the time being.

664
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:36,614
I'm worried he will stand on the brink of a precipice.

665
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:44,553
You just don't listen to what Kang Baek says.

666
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:46,894
He said he will do what is right.

667
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:49,163
It means he'll be investigated as a testifier

668
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:51,393
and turn himself in, like he said the other day.

669
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:56,263
He told me that he will be investigated as scheduled,

670
00:48:56,263 --> 00:49:00,534
that he asked the police to come get him if he can't make it.

671
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:03,774
His marriage or engagement is not the issue here.

672
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,543
Why...

673
00:49:06,814 --> 00:49:10,283
Why do you not listen to him?

674
00:49:10,283 --> 00:49:12,354
Do you pretend not to know?

675
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:14,784
Or can't you hear him?

676
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,723
I'll tell Hye Ryul and Professor Na to come home soon.

677
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:21,893
Okay.

678
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:24,933
Let's gather again in the reception room in an hour.

679
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:28,663
We'll organize our thoughts until then.

680
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:59,294
- Hi, Mom. 
 - Are you with Professor Na?

681
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:03,973
Yes.

682
00:50:03,973 --> 00:50:06,974
Hurry home. Kang Baek...

683
00:50:06,974 --> 00:50:09,904
No, just come straight home.

684
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:12,074
We'll talk here.

685
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:21,083
Refusing to be investigated may not be the answer.

686
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,084
Let him cooperate,

687
00:50:23,084 --> 00:50:25,953
and we'll have him plead the Fifth.

688
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:28,723
He is not in the condition to be investigated right now.

689
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:30,294
He must avoid it no matter what.

690
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,793
But he already made a call,

691
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:37,973
or do you want him to be taken like the actual culprit?

692
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,803
They have no evidence.

693
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:44,214
That is why they summoned him as a testifier, not a suspect.

694
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:47,484
If he makes a mistake during the investigation...

695
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:51,014
Hye Ryul, stay out of this from now on.

696
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,384
Professor Na will take charge instead.

697
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,753
- Grandpa! 
 - Someone unrelated is better.

698
00:50:57,753 --> 00:50:59,654
I'm his father.

699
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:01,993
Are you blood-related?

700
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,334
You're unrelated here.

701
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,834
- Legally, I am— 
 - The law doesn't hold any meaning.

702
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:16,674
The reporters are everywhere. Find a way to be unexposed.

703
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,374
What?

704
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:20,474
Okay.

705
00:51:20,474 --> 00:51:24,613
Hye Ryul, go to work and request a warrant.

706
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:27,084
Distract people's attention with Jusung's issue.

707
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:33,174
Don't let Kang Baek say a word. Not even a single word.

708
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,524
Do whatever it takes to do that, at least.

709
00:51:42,134 --> 00:51:45,004
They say the rich thrive for three generations even if they go down,

710
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,643
but they also say not many of them last three generations.

711
00:51:47,643 --> 00:51:50,674
Either way, it's decided within three generations.

712
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,044
Then, will the third generation be the end of this family?

713
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,694
Do you want it to be the end of you guys?

714
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:58,814
I'm sorry.

715
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:12,734
Honey, how did the talk go?

716
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:16,004
It's late at night. Let's go to bed and talk about this tomorrow.

717
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:17,504
Honey.

718
00:52:17,504 --> 00:52:20,944
I don't know anything about the law but I'm still worried.

719
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:24,073
I was so shocked to read those online comments.

720
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:27,313
What do you mean?

721
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:31,053
They say Kang Baek was engaged to a rich girl

722
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:33,283
when he was dating the dead girl.

723
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,624
That he only played around with her.

724
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:38,294
They were gossiping about all that ridiculous nonsense.

725
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:41,393
I still have a headache, and my heart feels stiff.

726
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:44,533
You're tender-hearted as is.

727
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,863
Don't read such comments for the time being.

728
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,504
My law firm will take action.

729
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,603
It's about our great-grandchild. I can't stop minding it.

730
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,243
Honey.

731
00:52:57,243 --> 00:53:00,343
You know how fast it spreads

732
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,714
when something is intriguing, groundless, and speculative.

733
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:03,715
Right.

734
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:05,354
If we push ahead with his wedding,

735
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:08,884
it will only give strength to this story.

736
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:14,064
When Kang Baek graduates, after some time from now, reconsider it then.

737
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:18,763
I understand the current situation but he is our only great-grandson.

738
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:22,704
I feel bad to marry him off in a rush like this,

739
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:25,904
and when he gets married,

740
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:31,343
I want to attend his wedding as a legal great-grandmother.

741
00:53:33,214 --> 00:53:36,413
No matter how urgent it is, a great-grandchild shouldn't

742
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,484
get married before his great-grandmother.

743
00:53:38,484 --> 00:53:40,484
Let's follow the order.

744
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:45,093
Oh, right. You're right.

745
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:49,723
It was you!

746
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:52,834
You did it!

747
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,133
What are you talking about?

748
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:58,984
I was out working all day and just finished the family meeting.

749
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:02,874
Of course, you didn't do it yourself.

750
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:05,243
That's not what you're like,

751
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:10,913
but Hong Nan Hee died because of you.

752
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:15,354
Look, Ham Gwang Jeon.

753
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:17,974
I may not be the best husband material

754
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:20,794
but don't frame me for murder.

755
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:24,323
It doesn't matter

756
00:54:24,323 --> 00:54:26,993
whether you killed her or not.

757
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:29,293
Whether you admit it or not,

758
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:33,703
I must cover up everything you've done.

759
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,834
That's how things have been.

760
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:38,874
In the end, this is what you were going for.

761
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:43,063
You even gave her a scholarship for this, didn't you?

762
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:45,884
To get something on me.

763
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:50,254
I thought you realized

764
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:55,494
how scary one could get if they had nothing to lose.

765
00:54:55,494 --> 00:54:58,634
You need to feed them as much as they wouldn't starve to death.

766
00:54:58,634 --> 00:55:01,134
You need to keep them as warm as they wouldn't freeze to death.

767
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:04,033
Only then, do they become docile.

768
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:08,143
Otherwise, they attack you instead. Shouldn't you be aware of it now?

769
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:12,543
Is that why you never let me get too close to you?

770
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:15,084
To tame me?

771
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:16,843
No.

772
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:21,223
I fed you too much with too much warmth

773
00:55:21,223 --> 00:55:24,424
that you've become oblivious as to who the master is here.

774
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:27,354
Is that why you're seeing Yoo Ye Hoo, that guy?

775
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:29,393
Because he is docile?

776
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:34,393
He has been true to you for more than 10 years.

777
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:36,603
So aside from everything else,

778
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:39,833
he is good at waiting for sure.

779
00:55:40,874 --> 00:55:43,603
Don't describe him like that.

780
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:48,743
Then let me put it in another way.

781
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:51,184
When Hong Nan Hee died,

782
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,183
what were you doing?

783
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,984
Why?

784
00:55:55,984 --> 00:55:59,424
Can't I accuse you of murder?

785
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,193
No.

786
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:07,594
I have an alibi,

787
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:10,703
although you won't be pleased to hear it.

788
00:56:15,303 --> 00:56:17,353
There's no need to talk more.

789
00:56:17,353 --> 00:56:19,444
Keep Kang Baek safe.

790
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,474
Then I will

791
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:24,484
keep your only son, Yoo Hyun,

792
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:27,183
safe.

793
00:56:34,564 --> 00:56:37,363
   

794
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:39,234
   

795
00:56:39,234 --> 00:56:41,464
Come in.

796
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,113
Take a seat.

797
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:56,343
Yoo Hyun,

798
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:59,484
something was omitted in your scholarship application.

799
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:03,854
This scholarship is from an outside organization,

800
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,453
so the grade must be converted into 100 in total.

801
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,133
I see.

802
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,334
I better submit it again.

803
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:16,434
   

804
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:24,854
You're better than my family.

805
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:26,414
What was that?

806
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,734
You're better than my family.

807
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:34,413
There are hundreds of students, but you're this attentive to me.

808
00:57:36,283 --> 00:57:40,083
I thought I could have a talk with you at the same time.

809
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:43,423
As a director myself, I need to be aware

810
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,633
of whether my students are doing well at school

811
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,294
or if they're having any inconveniences.

812
00:57:47,294 --> 00:57:49,564
I'm doing well.

813
00:57:49,564 --> 00:57:51,304
From now on,

814
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,573
I'd like to do better.

815
00:57:54,573 --> 00:57:56,044
Excuse me?

816
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:00,743
They say seeing is wanting. It can also mean

817
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:04,243
that you never want what you haven't seen.

818
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:09,953
Actually, I didn't want much in life.

819
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,494
But then,

820
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:16,863
now that I've joined the law school here,

821
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:20,564
I keep wanting to have more.

822
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:27,234
You better study harder then.

823
00:58:27,234 --> 00:58:29,103
Of course.

824
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,244
However,

825
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:36,224
some things can't be gained through studying.

826
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:42,084
For example, what Kang Baek has.

827
00:58:43,424 --> 00:58:45,423
When I see him,

828
00:58:45,423 --> 00:58:49,263
I get angry without realizing it.

829
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,593
As his uncle,

830
00:58:54,203 --> 00:58:57,303
I shouldn't feel that way about my nephew.

831
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:03,773
You...

832
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:08,613
Since when...

833
00:59:09,843 --> 00:59:11,343
Well,

834
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,884
what about you?

835
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:18,893
Kang Baek. Does he know?

836
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:23,294
Of course, he is in the dark.

837
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:24,894
Don't worry.

838
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,663
I'm not stupid enough to play this big card recklessly.

839
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,604
Instead,

840
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:38,343
help me,

841
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:41,413
so I won't have to expose it,

842
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:44,663
so I won't get the urge to do it.

843
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:46,714
Will you?

844
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:56,460
♫   Why is the world turning a blind eye?   ♫

845
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,760
♫   I have to   ♫

846
00:59:57,763 --> 01:00:01,270
    
 ♫   give it back  ♫

847
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:07,260
♫   If I take one last step   ♫

848
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,950
♫   I was going to give it to someone   ♫

849
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:17,490
♫   In the end, someone ended up getting it   ♫

850
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:23,820
♫   That pain that nobody wanted   ♫

851
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,170
♫   I can't even stop   ♫

852
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:34,100
♫   Because if I go one step further, it will end   ♫

853
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:43,640
♫   Countless twinkling   ♫

854
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,973
 I should've told her, but I couldn't! 

855
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:47,113
 I was too scared! 

856
01:00:47,113 --> 01:00:49,714
 Just what happened that night? 

857
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:52,113
 I killed Nan Hee. I'm going to turn myself in. 

858
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,723
 Now, there's only one thing we can do. 

859
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:55,953
 He was arrested. 

860
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,354
 Are you giving up on Na Geun Woo? 

861
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,924
 The murderer is in this family. 

862
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:00,794
 That man killed Hong Nan Hee. 

863
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,294
 We received a tip-off. 

864
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:04,464
 Liar. You're lying! 

865
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:08,520
 Let's stop now. Let's please stop, Mom! 

866
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:15,360
