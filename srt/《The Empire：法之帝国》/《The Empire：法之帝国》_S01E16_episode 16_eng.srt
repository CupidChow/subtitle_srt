1
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:03,430
   

2
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:11,639
Honey?

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,912
Honey?

4
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:15,580
Honey.

5
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,369
Honey.

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,084
Give me some water.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,990



8
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,233
Good morning, sir.

9
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,733
Good morning.

10
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,964
I don't see my wife.

11
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:40,434
Where did she go early in the morning?

12
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:41,774
Pardon?

13
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:44,525
We thought she was still asleep.

14
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:48,873
Why did you smirk?

15
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:51,294
Nothing, sir. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,128
What is it?

17
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:59,497
Why are you wearing Kang Ye's hairpin?

18
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:01,031
Here.

19
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,544
Father.

20
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,787
Ae Hun is not around.

21
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,519
She was going to leave one day.

22
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,394
She probably left because it was time.

23
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:37,453
But this is too sudden.

24
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:41,538
- I was dubious about her background, but... 
 - Maybe her background

25
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:44,677
was crazy enough for her to disappear overnight.

26
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:47,943
Gwang Jeon, do you know something?

27
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,498
No, not really.

28
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:54,715
I just trusted your judgment.

29
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,866
I mean, you're never wrong.

30
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,129
I chose the wrong person this time.

31
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,614
Get over it.

32
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:06,653
It seems she just ran away with some jewelry.

33
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,494
It wouldn't even cost much.

34
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,864
If she'd asked for alimony or division of assets,

35
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:14,144
it would've been a nuisance.

36
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,133
What's wrong, Father?

37
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:38,785
Father. Don't tell me...

38
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,102
It's gone. Everything.

39
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:47,184
Without it...

40
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,190
Without it...

41
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:04,060
Yes. Tell his daughter to pay a visit.

42
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,200
Are you doing all right?

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,923
- How's your mom? 
 - She's all right.

44
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,473
The surgery went well.

45
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:25,734
What about you?

46
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:29,413
I'm doing well.

47
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,344
I got some money for you to use.

48
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,474
There's no need.

49
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:37,534
You should use it for yourself.

50
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,012
We have no worries these days.

51
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,613
Your friend, who paid for Mom's surgery,

52
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,213
has been taking good care of us.

53
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,523
Oh, really?

54
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:50,267
So just take care of yourself.

55
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:51,964
You look too skinny.

56
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,716
Okay.

57
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:59,682
Dad, a reporter came.

58
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:01,922
According to her,

59
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,965
you didn't kill the law student.

60
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,114
What? Why?

61
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,814
Is it true?

62
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,712
By any chance...

63
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:26,123
Come to think of it, your friend sent a package for you today.

64
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:29,268
What? What package?

65
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:35,701
 I don't know. He said you'd need it. 

66
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:47,004
 Get him some snacks, 

67
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,763
 so that he can be stuffed at his last moment. 

68
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,893
 That should be enough of a message. 

69
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:14,518
Does Gwang Jeon know?

70
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:18,160
Not yet. I just hope she won't find out.

71
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:21,013
You arrogant rat!

72
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,654
How dare you even think of showing this to me?

73
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:28,834
You took me into this family because you valued this side of me.

74
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,994
I wonder how my wife will react

75
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:35,361
if she finds out whose idea this meeting was.

76
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:42,873
I'm not like Gwang Jeon and Hye Ryul.

77
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:45,373
I don't fear my children.

78
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,910
Right.

79
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,574
You're like me.

80
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,873
You're a collector too.

81
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:54,397
You collect very valuable secrets.

82
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:58,797
I heard you got your ledger stolen.

83
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,693
I'm in a similar situation.

84
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,793
The only difference is

85
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:07,224
what's stolen is the copy, while the original is safe

86
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,231
and the thief is dead.

87
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,003
I'll give it all to you.

88
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:15,420
It won't be as good as the ledger, but it'll still come in handy.

89
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,949
So, what is it that you want?

90
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,007
Dolphin, that scum, is too dangerous.

91
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,969
Please get rid of him.

92
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:34,777
We found an account for the cloud used to transfer the data.

93
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:38,797
If lucky, we might be able to find something out of this,

94
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,763
but the problem starts here.

95
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:44,603
It won't be possible without a warrant.

96
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,434
Yes.

97
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:50,093
It's against the Information Network Law.

98
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,987
Yes.

99
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,588
I'll give you a call. Bye.

100
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,727
The world has changed,

101
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,281
but this place is still the same.

102
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,215
What brought you here?

103
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:25,654
I wanted

104
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,767
to kill Hong Nan Hee.

105
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:34,554
Because she destroyed

106
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,621
what I cared about and cherished.

107
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,845
I really wanted her dead,

108
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:43,364
and wished someone would kill her.

109
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:47,182
I even had such an idea.

110
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:51,573
Honestly speaking, I didn't feel bad

111
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,991
about her death at all.

112
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,834
- Hye Ryul. 
 - Still,

113
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,574
I didn't kill her.

114
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,697
Right.

115
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:12,378
And the arrested culprit didn't kill her either.

116
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,468
What?

117
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,034
So, what are you planning to do?

118
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,661
I'll find the real culprit.

119
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,164
Even if I have to reveal everything,

120
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,613
I want to find them.

121
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:40,309
It will hurt you too.

122
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,063
It's true that you got fooled by Ko Won Kyung and Dolphin,

123
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,723
but it's also true that you made an illegal deal.

124
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:51,108
If I'd simply said

125
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:55,204
it wasn't Kang Baek

126
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:57,845
and that I sent him home,

127
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:02,788
he wouldn't have been accused.

128
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:06,473
My greed for a perfect family

129
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:11,281
made me keep my mouth shut. Kang Baek thought I did it

130
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,784
and was concealing the murder.

131
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,514
It was my fault.

132
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,121
You only had an affair.

133
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:23,781
As if it was for Kang Baek's sake,

134
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:27,164
I somehow ended up making a fake culprit

135
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,433
without knowing how devastated he was.

136
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,063
You're right.

137
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:35,904
I killed Kang Baek.

138
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:40,887
It was too harsh of me then.

139
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,613
I didn't mean it.

140
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:47,243
- If it's because of that... 
 - No, it's not because of what you said.

141
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:53,560
It's not because I was hurt, nor is it because I feel guilty.

142
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,840
Kang Baek's last request was

143
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:02,338
to stop doing what was wrong.

144
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,697
To do that,

145
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,175
I need to repent first.

146
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,452
All right.

147
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,385
Then,

148
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,717
there's something you must see.

149
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:29,453
What's in it?

150
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,974
You better

151
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:34,597
see it when you're alone.

152
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:41,703
Whatever decision you make afterward, I...

153
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,888
will follow.

154
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,174
All right.

155
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:20,343
- All right. Let's clink. 
 - Sure!

156
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,573
Cheers!

157
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:25,546
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

158
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,953
I should've arranged this way sooner.

159
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:32,723
I'm sorry it took so long!

160
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:33,924
I'm sorry!

161
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:38,720
We got together like this. That's good enough.

162
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,034
The moment it goes public that the three of you gathered together,

163
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:46,203
it will cause a huge uproar in the country.

164
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:49,174
So especially today, I prepared a private elevator

165
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:53,504
and emptied this floor and the one below.

166
00:11:53,504 --> 00:12:00,544
You wouldn't know how grateful I am for Jusung's generous support.

167
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,254
- Thank you! 
 - Don't mention it.

168
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,684
As a token of gratitude, I'll drink this all up at once!

169
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,931
Gosh.

170
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,113
Thank you!

171
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:18,563
By the way, are you sure about Christmas Fund?

172
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:23,534
Must you ruin the mood at this time?

173
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,544
Consider it a small loss at the beginning of your investment.

174
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:28,943
Hey, move aside.

175
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:30,073
All right!

176
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,926
Senior Secretary Ahn, right here,

177
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:37,453
is going to set everything up for us.

178
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,554
Right, Senior Secretary Ahn?

179
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:46,493
The VIP would never make an order that could cause harm to Jusung.

180
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,233
Did you hear him?

181
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,764
Is that right?

182
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:53,827
If that's the VIP's intention, I shouldn't be worried.

183
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,874
The liquor tastes so sweet tonight.

184
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:01,674
There's no need to build friendships at a sauna.

185
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:05,983
We can scratch each other's itch just fine this way!

186
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,384
- Right? 
 - Yes, Father-in-law.

187
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:12,424
Sir, let me scratch your itch!

188
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,853
- Let's clink. 
 - Cheers!

189
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,294
We'll keep this mood going!

190
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,065
- Let's drink and die! 
 - Cheers!

191
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,353
Let's drink and die!

192
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:23,127
Do you need some scratching too?

193
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,707
Hold on.

194
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:48,323
- Attorney Nam. 
 - Goodness.

195
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,503
Geez.

196
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,794
What took you so long? I waited so much for you.

197
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,497
Did you bring it?

198
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,790
From now on,

199
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,205
let's start having some real fun!

200
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,387
How exciting!

201
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,062
All right!

202
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:28,393
All right, then. Senior Secretary Ahn, you first!

203
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:48,191
 Let's drink! 

204
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,384
 Drink up! 

205
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,554
 Let's drink! 

206
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:55,313
 Let's drink and die! 

207
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,597
 Yes! 

208
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,820
 Let's drink! 

209
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,463
Goodness.

210
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,510
Come in.

211
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,464
Did you ask for me?

212
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,443
What are you doing? Have a seat.

213
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:50,128
Okay.

214
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,843
First off, I'm sorry.

215
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,083
For what?

216
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,343
We're going to be very busy for the next few weeks.

217
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:07,274
We're resuming our investigation on Jusung.

218
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,453
We got new evidence,

219
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:14,834
and it's so concrete that no one can overturn it.

220
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:18,233
How... What is it?

221
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,774
I'll show you later.

222
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:23,944
Hong Nan Hee's murder case will be reinvestigated too.

223
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,148
We won't be in charge of it,

224
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:29,548
but I'll be an important testifier of that case.

225
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,753
It will keep me busy,

226
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:37,624
so I'd like you to take charge and lead the investigation.

227
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:39,463
I don't understand.

228
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,564
The murderer already got arrested.

229
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:44,193
The indictment was made, and the trial is in a few days.

230
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:47,565
He's not the culprit. I confirmed it myself.

231
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:50,560
- What? 
 - I'll explain it later too.

232
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:54,644
The confession should be taken back first.

233
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:57,743
The biggest problem is the purse that was submitted as evidence.

234
00:16:57,743 --> 00:17:01,114
Because of that purse, we became sure he did it

235
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,884
and closed the investigation.

236
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:06,223
Hong Nan Hee's roommate testified

237
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,253
that she carried the purse when she went outside.

238
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:12,793
Besides, her DNA and the culprit's DNA were found in it.

239
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,364
It had another man's DNA as well,

240
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,693
but we have no sample to compare it with.

241
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:20,864
It's not like DNAs are registered in a system like fingerprints.

242
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:24,603
Just in case, we searched the identification database,

243
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:27,043
but we couldn't get anything out of it.

244
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:30,714
So you don't know who murdered Hong Nan Hee

245
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:34,943
and brought her purse to the fake culprit.

246
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:37,463
- And there's no way to find out. 
 - Right.

247
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,684
So we're planning to check the account we found the other day.

248
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,604
We don't know what we will find.

249
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:47,993
 - Let's drink! 
 - Let's drink! 

250
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:51,678
 Let's drink! 

251
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,003
You will...

252
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,517
expose this?

253
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,084
Well, what I want is to investigate.

254
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,207
I already am.

255
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,253
This was in Hong Nan Hee's flash drive.

256
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,884
It gives a good enough reason to open the cloud account.

257
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,154
Even if not for that,

258
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:21,118
- investigating what these people in the video did that day... 
 - Senior.

259
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,293
One of them is your father,

260
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:27,203
and this isn't just a simple lobbying activity.

261
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:31,744
If I'm to find the murderer of the girl who tried to report this,

262
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,956
I shouldn't play safe.

263
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,886
What...

264
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,291
are you planning to do?

265
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,929
- I'll run away from home. 
 - What?

266
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,626
Cover it up!

267
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:03,104
You're still quite resourceful,

268
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:06,374
but it's not as good.

269
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,443
The warrant was issued this morning.

270
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,513
Such concrete, direct evidence was found.

271
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:14,844
It must've been impossible even for you to stop this.

272
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:17,375
You're crossing the line!

273
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,523
This will be a humiliation to the family.

274
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,293
A father-in-law and a son-in-law together... Not a chance.

275
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,953
I don't need your permission.

276
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:27,424
There's another way to get Jusung and Dolphin,

277
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:32,634
- but this is too lousy... 
 - Truth is bound to be lousy, you see.

278
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:35,374
The neater a ruling is,

279
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,146
the more things are omitted and twisted within.

280
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:41,769
I'm sure you know.

281
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,352
Hye Ryul!

282
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,314
Hye Ryul, please reconsider.

283
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,354
You won't be safe from it either.

284
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,878
I'm sorry, Mom.

285
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:55,015
I'll get going.

286
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,818
Father!

287
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,463
You knew about the video, didn't you?

288
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:24,513
Was that your idea from the get-go?

289
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:25,753
Be quiet!

290
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:28,453
Pull the cash from the bank accounts under borrowed names.

291
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,324
What are you talking about? You don't have your ledger anymore.

292
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:34,963
Some people might not have heard, so get the cash while we can.

293
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,094
What are you planning to do?

294
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:38,334
We just have to talk to a few smart ones.

295
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,733
Dolphin is an inmate who scammed billions of dollars.

296
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,273
We're not like him. We can deflect attention to him.

297
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:47,074
- Then— 
 - How are we any different from him?

298
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:50,414
Is there anything in the house we haven't stolen from other people?

299
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,543
- What? 
 - The assets from Grandpa?

300
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,713
You didn't inherit them. You took them from him!

301
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:57,983
And Grandpa stole other people's assets too!

302
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,447
- What did you say? 
 - If you weren't so greedy,

303
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:05,963
Mom, Ye Hoo, Aunt, and Kang Baek could have been here with us!

304
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,394
It's all because of you!

305
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:09,864
- You... 
 - What?

306
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,963
Do you still think I'm a little kid who's scared of you?

307
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:15,008
What did you say? You...

308
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,388
Let go of me!

309
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:26,898
Father!

310
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:31,483
Father! Stay with me!

311
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,931
- Butler Yang! 
 - Gosh!

312
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,894
Father, wake up!

313
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,570
Father!

314
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,750
Is this 911?

315
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,627
He fell from the staircase and hit his head. Yes.

316
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:53,889
He missed his footing.

317
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:57,213
Yes. He's an old man who will turn 90 soon.

318
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:59,285
Please hurry.

319
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,359
The address is...

320
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:08,324
   

321
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,624
Yes. What happened?

322
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:13,784
 I opened the account on the cloud. 

323
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,493
I found an audio file and photos she uploaded

324
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:17,962
on the day of the incident.

325
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,591
- Senior.
  - Yes. 

326
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,363
I think we got the culprit. You should listen to it yourself.

327
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:30,073
 What do you want? 

328
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:34,068
 I wanted to talk to you in private, 

329
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,674
 so I was waiting for you this whole time. 

330
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:39,283
 I'm not complaining or anything. 

331
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:41,287
 While I was waiting, 

332
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:44,716
 I enjoyed a rare sight. 

333
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:47,978
This voice...

334
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,592
belongs to Attorney Nam, right?

335
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:53,511
Yes.

336
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:54,803
The security app on her phone

337
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:55,973
activated the camera to take photos

338
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,904
and uploaded it to the cloud when he failed to unlock her phone.

339
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:03,004
In other words, people use this app to catch phone thieves,

340
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:06,763
so we got a very clear photo of Attorney Nam.

341
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:16,993
Call the detention center now,

342
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:19,223
and check on the man who turned himself in for the murder.

343
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:22,844
I'm on my way there. Don't let anyone see him

344
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,902
 before I get there. 

345
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:05,799
   

346
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,783
   

347
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,023
Ma'am, what is this urgent matter about?

348
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,520
Where's the inmate?

349
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,062
Oh, him. Well...

350
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:41,431
What brings you here, Ms. Han?

351
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:43,914
I'm in the middle of a meeting with my client.

352
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:46,554
I would like to talk to him in private.

353
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:54,158
I hope you're not trying to stop me from talking to my client.

354
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,199
He killed Hong Nan Hee.

355
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:04,700
What on earth...

356
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,673
What do you think you're doing? Get out of here!

357
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:13,513
If I were you, I would do my best to get as far as I could.

358
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:18,776
I just obtained evidence that you killed Hong Nan Hee.

359
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,995
Everyone will find out that you

360
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,686
messed everything up.

361
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:53,649
I want my ID.

362
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,294
Even Dolphin didn't know that Attorney Nam was the culprit.

363
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:16,498
Technically, Attorney Nam used Dolphin too.

364
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:20,874
In the end, he managed to cover up the murder with Dolphin's money.

365
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,457
No.

366
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:25,064
I don't know anything.

367
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,743
Right.

368
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:31,293
I forgot to tell you something. I should have started with this.

369
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:34,994
The bag you submitted as evidence.

370
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:38,773
The police mishandled the evidence, so it's missing.

371
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:40,324
In other words,

372
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:43,533
your confession is the only thing that's tying you to the murder.

373
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,534
The Criminal Code requires us

374
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,404
to provide supplementary evidence for confessions.

375
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,640
In your case, we can't indict you based on your confession.

376
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,217
What?

377
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:57,281
You're innocent.

378
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:02,414
Well, you might be charged with obstruction of justice, not murder,

379
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:07,354
but your sentence will be reduced if you tell the truth now.

380
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:09,090
No.

381
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:13,026
- What do you mean? 
 - I have to be the culprit.

382
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:15,354
I can't be found innocent.

383
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:16,964
But you didn't kill her.

384
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:20,233
I didn't kill her, so I was paid to make a confession.

385
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,703
I already used up the money. I can't pay it back now.

386
00:27:23,703 --> 00:27:25,660
If I get released now,

387
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,013
what do you think Dolphin will take when I can't pay him back?

388
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,773
He knows the names of my family, where they live,

389
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:33,906
go to school, and work.

390
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:39,253
If Dolphin thinks that I'm the one who talked...

391
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:41,614
I have to be the culprit.

392
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,094
I'm the culprit.

393
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,345
The girl is already dead.

394
00:27:45,345 --> 00:27:47,949
She has nothing to do with you.

395
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,741
Please.

396
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:54,169
Please do this for me.

397
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,573
Please don't put my family in harm's way.

398
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:58,209
I'm begging you!

399
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,682
Please save them!

400
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,793
We have enough evidence to get a warrant issued,

401
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,793
so we can collect his DNA, right?

402
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:19,894
Yes.

403
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:23,594
So were you able to obtain the inmate's statement?

404
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:26,033
With his statement, the case will get solved easily.

405
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:29,778
He was bought off to play the culprit.

406
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:32,234
In a way, I'm partially responsible.

407
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:35,137
It happened because of my greed,

408
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,503
so I'll take responsibility for it.

409
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:41,714
Are you coming?

410
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,453
We have a pile of stuff to do.

411
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:44,553
Okay.

412
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:47,229
I'll get going then.

413
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:52,914
Get in the front seat.

414
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:17,384
According to the newly obtained video,

415
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,023
 Han Gun Do, the managing partner of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, 

416
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:24,253
 and Chairman Ji Joon Ki, the financier of the Christmas Fund,  

417
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:27,873
 coordinated secret meetings with Senior Secretary Ahn Ji Hwan 

418
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:32,434
 and Vice Chairman Jung Tae Eul of Jusung. 

419
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,254
Get your hands off me.

420
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,154
Seriously.

421
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:54,024
 Vice Chairman Jung Tae Eul of Jusung 

422
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:55,353
made illegal investments with the funds from Jusung

423
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:58,023
and invested in the Christmas Fund,

424
00:29:58,023 --> 00:29:59,564
which was facing a possible suspension

425
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,493
due to its poor management of the funds.

426
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:02,594
Instead of minimizing the loss

427
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,334
on the government's investment in the Christmas Fund,

428
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:07,604
we confirmed Senior Secretary Ahn Ji Hwan promised

429
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:11,033
that Jusung would be evaluated favorably for Vice Chairman

430
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,773
to inherit the management rights for the mergers and acquisitions

431
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:16,870
of Jusung's subsidiaries.

432
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,782
Was that the video file Ms. Hong Nan Hee had?

433
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:21,684
Was that the video

434
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:24,914
Ms. Hong Nan Hee, who was found dead in the campus lake,

435
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:28,561
planned to give to me?

436
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:33,368
- This is all for today's— 
 - Yes.

437
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:35,271
That's correct.

438
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,733
How did the video come into Ms. Hong's possession?

439
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:41,263
What's the connection between this case and Ms. Hong's case?

440
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:43,404
How was the video submitted as evidence?

441
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:45,404
Did Ms. Hong report the video to the police before she died?

442
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:47,003
How come this was submitted just now?

443
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:49,473
- Were you pressured? 
 - Why now?

444
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,213
- Please answer our questions. 
 - How did this just come about?

445
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,543
Why aren't you disclosing the video?

446
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:56,654
As for the aforementioned bribery case,

447
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,154
we neither overlooked anything

448
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:00,684
nor went easy on them. We strictly followed the law.

449
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:03,793
 So everyone has been indicted now, 

450
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:06,894
 and we have finished our investigation and collected 

451
00:31:06,894 --> 00:31:10,293
 all the necessary evidence to prove their crimes. 

452
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:11,697
   

453
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:14,664
I solemnly swear

454
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,803
to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth

455
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:19,174
under the pains and penalties of perjury.

456
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:21,574
 And during our investigation, 

457
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:23,814
 we confirmed that in an attempt to get rid of the video, 

458
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,084
 Attorney Nam Soo Hyuk of Ham &amp; Lee killed Ms. Hong 

459
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,914
 when she tried to disclose the video to the media, 

460
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:31,783
 and bribed an innocent man 

461
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:35,223
 to make a false confession as Ms. Hong's murderer. 

462
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,753
 And he was indicted as well. 

463
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:41,094
Defendant Ko Won Kyung and his co-defendant, Park Hong Kyu...

464
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,894
 And other individuals who were involved in this case 

465
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,034
 will face punishment 

466
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,404
 based on our law. 

467
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:50,434
Knowing about the false confession,

468
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,604
he was concerned that his son, the late Han Kang Baek,

469
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:55,203
who was a person of interest in the case, would be suspected

470
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:59,114
as the deceased victim, Hong Nan Hee's murderer.

471
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:01,584
So this is considered harboring the culprit.

472
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:02,983
Through a deceptive plan,

473
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:07,347
he allowed the co-defendant to obstruct justice.

474
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:10,735
Defendant Nam Soo Hyuk

475
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:15,763
murdered the victim brutally and abandoned the corpse,

476
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:19,334
and to hide his crime,

477
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:23,233
he bribed another man to make a false confession.

478
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,162
He incited the concealment of the culprit

479
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:29,513
and obstructed justice through a deceptive plan.

480
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:32,673
So a grave punishment is fitting for the defendant.

481
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:35,914
Furthermore, the Court recognizes that the defendant

482
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:39,738
used and possessed narcotics.

483
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:42,214
Therefore, Defendant Nam Soo Hyuk

484
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:46,703
will face 20 years in prison.

485
00:32:47,664 --> 00:32:50,834
It wasn't me! I didn't push her into the lake!

486
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,064
It wasn't me!

487
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,634
Hong Nan Hee drowned,

488
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:58,104
but I never pushed her into the lake!

489
00:32:58,104 --> 00:32:59,674
It wasn't me!

490
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,709
Hong Nan Hee drowned!

491
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,414
So it's over.

492
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,433
Good work.

493
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:12,854
Gosh. What a strange case this was.

494
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:15,584
What? Do you still feel like we missed something?

495
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:20,593
No. The medical examiner said Ms. Hong drowned.

496
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,769
Then the person

497
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:26,164
who pushed her into the lake when she was alive is the culprit.

498
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:28,164
What? What's your point?

499
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,004
If Nam Soo Hyuk was the real culprit,

500
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:33,364
what was he doing there? Why didn't he leave right away?

501
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:36,314
What are you talking about?

502
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,374
Don't you remember what the medical examiner said?

503
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:39,814
Something was off.

504
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:42,444
There was a delay between the skull fracture and drowning.

505
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,653
The skull fracture was critical,

506
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,283
so if she wasn't treated, she would have died anyway.

507
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:49,131
I know that,

508
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:51,964
but what if there was one more person?

509
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:57,418
What if someone else dumped her into the lake as Nam Soo Hyuk said?

510
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:59,863
Attorney Nam took her bag.

511
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,604
During the trial, he said he got rid of

512
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:05,834
Ms. Hong's USB flash drive and cell phone.

513
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:09,573
The recording file of his threat is on Ms. Hong's cloud account,

514
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:12,814
and he was photographed trying to unlock her phone.

515
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:14,934
That's all the evidence we need!

516
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:16,214
Gosh. You're right.

517
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:19,254
You're on the right track as long as you don't get paranoid.

518
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:22,453
By the way, there's one thing for sure.

519
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:26,664
Detectives often wonder, "What if I got the wrong guy?"

520
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,279
But you don't have to worry about that in this case.

521
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:32,763
Well done!

522
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:34,234
You worked hard too!

523
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:36,533
Right. You should buy me a meal.

524
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,533
   

525
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,653
Is this your trick to avoid disciplinary action?

526
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:55,184
Okay. Go ahead,

527
00:34:55,184 --> 00:35:00,093
but the only disciplinary action I'll accept is dismissal.

528
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:03,114
- What? 
 - You must be scared.

529
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:05,294
Your wrongdoings will also come to light,

530
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:08,574
if you try to punish me for what I've done,

531
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,780
especially after what happened to Mr. Ko.

532
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:18,843
Are you threatening me?

533
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,110
No.

534
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,160
I at least know I'm neither capable nor ethical to be a prosecutor,

535
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:26,354
so I want to resign as fast as I can.

536
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:28,497
Han Hye Ryul,

537
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:32,408
you really are stubborn.

538
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:37,664
After destroying your own family, you want to live in peace now.

539
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:42,834
But aren't you the one who benefited the most from my stubbornness?

540
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:47,274
Since you switched sides quickly, my investigation went smoothly.

541
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:50,857
Maybe I should say I benefited from you.

542
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:55,702
I don't follow you.

543
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,665
Do you think you're the only righteous prosecutor?

544
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:03,653
If you count the number of CEOs I locked away,

545
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:05,894
your number won't even come close.

546
00:36:05,894 --> 00:36:08,098
- Back in the day— 
 - Right.

547
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,862
I won't be able to catch up.

548
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:13,174
I still have a lot to learn,

549
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:15,734
especially your ability to play politics.

550
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:17,573
You can change your stance based on the situation.

551
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:21,338
No. You become a different person.

552
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:24,340
I will never be able to do that.

553
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,343
That's why you're the chief prosecutor,

554
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:31,371
and a senior prosecutor is as far as I could go.

555
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,861
So I'll apologize for my recklessness in the past.

556
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:41,661
Please be an assemblyman.

557
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:45,128
That suits you better, sir.

558
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:11,086
   

559
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:15,249
Where's Gwang Jeon?

560
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,201
She went to the US with Kang Ye.

561
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,403
The US?

562
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:25,703
Yes. She retired, so when Kang Ye went abroad—

563
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:28,173
Hey! What's the point of explaining it again?

564
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,553
He'll forget it in an hour or so.

565
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:35,544
Here. Tuck this in.

566
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,792
Okay.

567
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,684
Take your time, and make sure to chew a lot.

568
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,244
Where's my wife?

569
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,823
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

570
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:47,593
Yesterday, my foot.

571
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:50,289
Lee Ae Hun left a long time ago.

572
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:52,290
Lee Ae Hun?

573
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:55,226
Who's Lee Ae Hun?

574
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:56,673
She's nobody.

575
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:59,253
Don't listen to her. Please have your meal.

576
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,472
There they come!

577
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:21,723
How do you feel now?

578
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,164
Do you accept the ruling?

579
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,093
So Christmas Fund wasn't really used as a bribe

580
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:26,633
for the succession of Jusung's management rights?

581
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:29,064
Did you know you would get out on probation today?

582
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:30,874
- Wait! 
 - Please give us a comment!

583
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,903
- Just a comment! 
 - Answer our questions!

584
00:38:33,903 --> 00:38:34,944
- Hold on! 
 - Wait!

585
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:38,023
- Come on. They left! 
 - Wait!

586
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,859
I'm glad that you're out, honey.

587
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,444
- You're still here? 
 - What?

588
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:57,474
I hoped you would be gone by the time I got out.

589
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:01,829
Are you that dense? Or do you not have a place to go?

590
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:12,113
 The CEO of Ham &amp; Lee, Han Gun Do, 

591
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,414
 and Vice Chairman Jung Tae Eul of Jusung 

592
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,044
 had their appeals sentenced today. 

593
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:18,984
 The appellate tribunal acquitted them of some of their charges, 

594
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,153
 so they overturned their original sentence, five-year imprisonment. 

595
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:25,161
-  They were sentenced to two years and a half on probation—   
 - Gosh.

596
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:30,702
Jusung and Ham &amp; Lee are indeed on another level.

597
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,613
By the way,

598
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:37,437
only Senior Secretary Ahn's sentence didn't change.

599
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,073
The thing about him is that

600
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:42,544
he got his position through connections, to begin with.

601
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:45,107
He basically came from nowhere.

602
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,644
Just look.

603
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:50,113
They will report about Han Gun Do and Jung Tae Eul in breaking news,

604
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:53,783
but they will write a few lines about Ahn Ji Hwan.

605
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:59,354
People have already forgotten who Ahn Ji Hwan was.

606
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:02,506
He was just tossed out.

607
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,664
I get it. A new administration is in power now.

608
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:09,707
In a way, he should be happy that he didn't get a heavier sentence.

609
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,354
Goodness!

610
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:14,874
Sir! Hello.

611
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:16,914
Gosh. Where are my manners?

612
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,533
Hello, Assemblyman Jang.

613
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm getting used to it too.

614
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,739
Salute.

615
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:29,323
Assemblyman Jang, please sit here.

616
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,224
Gosh.

617
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:34,104
The Vice Minister and the District Representative will be here.

618
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:37,593
I'm not sure if I should sit at the head of the table.

619
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:39,493
Please don't say that.

620
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:40,504
You reformed the prosecution

621
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,263
and uprooted any connections between the government and businesses.

622
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:45,934
Who's going to sit there, if not our famous prosecutor?

623
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,274
- Don't you agree? 
 - Of course.

624
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,743
Given your ratings, you might have a chance to win

625
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:53,414
the presidential election, not just the general election.

626
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:55,518
The general election.

627
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,273
The presidential election.

628
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,623
- Let's have a drink first. 
 - Sure.

629
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,195
Okay.

630
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,363
All right. To the presidential election!

631
00:41:10,363 --> 00:41:12,148
Let's do this!

632
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:14,774
Let's go for the presidential election.

633
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,414
   

634
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:26,113
Well, here's the thing.

635
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:33,524
Your disability isn't considered a fair reason for dismissal,

636
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,923
so your case will be viewed as an unfair dismissal.

637
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:38,553
I suggest you file a wrongful dismissal claim

638
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,794
through the Labor Relations Commission.

639
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:42,024
   

640
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:44,394
If there are things you don't understand, you can email us.

641
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:46,164
We're here every Wednesday,

642
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:48,504
so feel free to come back if you have any questions.

643
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:50,834
- Great, thank you. 
 - No problem.

644
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,601
   

645
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,557
Kang Baek.

646
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:58,314
I did the right thing, right?

647
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:04,837
Being able to go to bed without feeling the burden of guilt

648
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:08,269
and waking up without feeling ashamed.

649
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:11,930
That's the kind of mother you wanted, right?

650
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,859
I'm sorry, Kang Baek.

651
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:24,216
Had I listened to what you had to say even just once... No.

652
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:30,645
Had I been honest with you and told you everything,

653
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:37,078
then we would've been able to spend more time together.

654
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:43,312
I didn't know what was truly important.

655
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:47,798
That's why I made you suffer so much.

656
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,925
I'm sorry, Kang Baek.

657
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,534
But you know,

658
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,616
despite everything,

659
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:08,885
I am truly grateful to you for coming to me as my son.

660
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,020
♫  From afar  ♫

661
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,938
I miss you so much.

662
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:31,970
♫  ...train wheels answer?  ♫

663
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:35,258
- Hey! 
 - Over here!

664
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:38,144
- Come on! 
 - Hey, throw it!

665
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:41,768
- Hey, go for it! 
 - Go!

666
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:44,854
- What? 
 - Did we score? Hey!

667
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:46,526
- Darn it! 
 - Oh, boy.

668
00:43:46,526 --> 00:43:50,537
- Hey! No! 
 - Come on!

669
00:43:50,537 --> 00:43:53,694
- Hey! 
 - Over here!

670
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:56,863
- Throw it! 
 - Come on!

671
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,294
Would you care for a cigarette?

672
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:01,346
Hey, get him!

673
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,122
 Come on, move it! 

674
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,604
 - Go for it! 
 - Throw it! 

675
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,071
 - Hey. 
 - Come on! 

676
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,044
- Go! 
- Go for it!

677
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:16,564
 - Hey, pass it to him! 
 - Over here! 

678
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:23,093
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:34,444
It really wasn't me.

680
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:38,374
Well, it doesn't really matter now, does it?

681
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:40,554
I'm going to apply for a retrial.

682
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:45,774
Hong Nan Hee drowned, but I never threw her into the lake.

683
00:44:45,774 --> 00:44:46,843
Right.

684
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:50,243
That prosecutor indicted me for murder

685
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:52,845
but failed to prove such details.

686
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:56,291
You call that a ruling?

687
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:59,148
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:04,229
I'm sorry.

689
00:45:05,394 --> 00:45:07,242
I'm sorry.

690
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:09,839
Hey!

691
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:15,743
If I don't repay my debt,

692
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:19,704
they will kill my entire family! They'll kill them brutally!

693
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:36,949
I'm sorry. I really am.

694
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:52,274
   

695
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:50,898
   

696
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:55,732
What I want to reveal is something else.

697
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:02,822
I'm sure you know where these are from.

698
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:07,183
Now that the situation has changed, the conditions should also change.

699
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,754
Who are you? How did you...

700
00:47:09,754 --> 00:47:12,093
What? How does she have these photos?

701
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:13,993
Apologize

702
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:18,334
to my father and the factory staff,

703
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:22,014
and apologize to me.

704
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:26,834
If not, this will be the headline for tomorrow's news cycle.

705
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,743
Sir, how... Just how...

706
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:32,513
How did Hong Nan Hee get her hands on that video?

707
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:35,243
- Is that important now? 
 - It sure is important.

708
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,914
- Back then, we made sure to— 
 - That's right.

709
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:40,653
How could such a video exist in the first place?

710
00:47:40,653 --> 00:47:45,181
We were extremely thorough and careful!

711
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,155
   

712
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:00,387
Here.

713
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:06,403
Don't get the wrong idea. I only kept it just in case.

714
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:09,933
If even just one of them pulls out, we'll have a problem.

715
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,484
That's why you called me here?

716
00:48:16,484 --> 00:48:20,584
To get me roped into this so you can use me to clean up your mess?

717
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:27,218
Hey, Attorney Nam. Calm down, okay?

718
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:29,303
Don't say things that you'll regret later.

719
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:32,434
Let's be rational about this and come up with a plan.

720
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:35,274
It's not like we don't have a single weapon.

721
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,643
That car sex photo?

722
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:40,084
Yes. Let's send it to Kang Baek.

723
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,044
Kang Baek?

724
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,544
Clearly, that little witch

725
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:46,564
doesn't know what she's dealing with here.

726
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:51,194
Let her have a little taste so she can see what she's up against.

727
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,694
Obviously, that photo will make Kang Baek fuming mad.

728
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:59,221
He loves his mother very much.

729
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,848
Then what?

730
00:49:02,848 --> 00:49:04,893
Then we'll tell her.

731
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:07,913
"At the moment, only one person knows,

732
00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:11,774
but everyone will find out if you don't keep your mouth shut."

733
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:13,981
What if that isn't enough?

734
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:17,784
What if she threatens us that she'll go ahead and reveal it?

735
00:49:18,314 --> 00:49:20,062
Well, then...

736
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:24,160
What can we do?

737
00:49:29,794 --> 00:49:32,074
We'll have to kill her.

738
00:49:32,074 --> 00:49:35,077
What should we eat in Sokcho?

739
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:40,824
It has so many delicious restaurants there.

740
00:51:46,894 --> 00:51:50,426
Die. Then die!

741
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:52,939
Kang Baek!

742
00:51:59,944 --> 00:52:01,627
Kang Baek.

743
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:04,748
Go home. Now!

744
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:14,093
You are a true monster.

745
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:17,789
I could never be a monster.

746
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:19,794
I don't have that much power.

747
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:21,600
Ms. Han,

748
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:25,207
Hong Tae Hoon, the CEO of Hongyeon Engineering.

749
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:27,593
You don't recognize his name, do you?

750
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:30,776
I expected that.

751
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,314
You're only interested in cases like illegal successions of management

752
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:36,884
that cost tens of millions of dollars or disturbances in the market,

753
00:52:36,884 --> 00:52:42,754
but you're not at all interested in what Jusung did to its subcontractors with Ham &amp; Lee's help.

754
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:47,494
To make sure the 100,000-dollar promissory note went through to avoid going bankrupt,

755
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:51,234
he sold his late wife's wedding present out of desperation.

756
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:54,500
You neither know how it feels nor are interested in finding out.

757
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:57,697
Besides,

758
00:52:57,697 --> 00:53:03,032
you should be more careful of people who want to use me, not me.

759
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:43,026
 I'll meet you at the place, between 11 p.m. and 11:20 p.m. 

760
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:06,829
What do you want?

761
00:54:08,104 --> 00:54:10,373
I wanted to talk to you in private,

762
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:13,662
so I was waiting for you this whole time.

763
00:54:13,662 --> 00:54:15,644
I'm not complaining or anything.

764
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:21,468
While I was waiting, I enjoyed a rare sight.

765
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:26,108
It was you. The person who sent Kang Baek the photos.

766
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:29,326
You're not so bad.

767
00:54:29,326 --> 00:54:32,064
Any idea what I'm going to do?

768
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:35,034
I'm not so sure.

769
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:36,770
I see.

770
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:42,885
The photos I sent to Han Kang Baek.

771
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:46,503
I'm going to post them on a website that uses an untraceable foreign server.

772
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:50,984
Then it'll take less than an hour to dox who you are.

773
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:54,447
Na Geun Woo, female student,

774
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:56,416
car sex.

775
00:54:56,416 --> 00:55:00,382
Who would overlook this?

776
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:03,423
What do you want?

777
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,207
Give me the original file you have

778
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:09,234
or your photos will make the headline tomorrow.

779
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:13,573
This isn't about ordinary sexual favors or lobbies.

780
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:17,490
Are you threatening me?

781
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:20,148
Threatening you?

782
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,526
Threatening...

783
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:25,574
It does meet the condition for that.

784
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:28,245
I guess...

785
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:33,964
you weren't just flirting with the law school professor, were you?

786
00:55:51,774 --> 00:55:54,002
You should've

787
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:57,792
comprehended it when I was being nice to you.

788
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:01,084
Why did you have to act stupid and make it worse?

789
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:02,767
Why?

790
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:15,291
Attorney Nam!

791
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:18,641
You looked like a real villain!

792
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:23,220
- What? 
 - In movies,

793
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:28,014
villains always chitchat and mess everything up.

794
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:29,984
They think so highly of themselves.

795
00:56:29,984 --> 00:56:32,413
Why do they have to explain so much

796
00:56:32,413 --> 00:56:36,205
when everything they do is wrongdoing?

797
00:56:36,205 --> 00:56:37,330
What are you doing?

798
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,748
What do you think?

799
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:43,498
You just messed things up.

800
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,093
   

801
00:56:46,093 --> 00:56:49,206
This is a total scoop.

802
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,175
Thank you, Attorney Nam.

803
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:58,504
Besides, Han Hye Ryul will soon find out it was you who sent the photos.

804
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:00,143
Why did you do that?

805
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:05,683
Han Kang Baek is their precious child, not even Han Gun Do can mess with him.

806
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:10,290
They hold a lot over you, don't they?

807
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:13,185
So...

808
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:17,168
why did you have to act stupid and make things worse?

809
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:20,080
   

810
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,890
Damn it!

811
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:25,313
   

812
00:58:57,263 --> 00:58:59,283
Help...

813
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:02,924
Help me.

814
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,053
Han Gun Do?

815
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:20,950

823
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,900
♫  Shining countless times  ♫

824
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,450
♫  Fragments of a past life  ♫

825
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:29,790
♫  It must have been shining back then  ♫

826
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,090
♫  The weight of a dreadful life  ♫

827
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,980
♫  Piling up, piling up, someday will collapse without strength   ♫

828
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,970
♫  I didn't know it was going to come down  ♫

829
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:54,950



830
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:05,500
♫  Like a photo, all the past is fading  ♫

831
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:12,640
♫  Have had it for a long time. All my memories are fading  ♫

832
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:19,820
♫  No bright. One memory as if my hand was cut  ♫

833
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:25,590
♫  The pain digs deep  ♫

834
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:35,250
♫  My getting faster  ♫

835
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:41,450
♫  My heart feels like it's about to explode  ♫

836
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,640
♫  Why does the world turn away...?   ♫

837
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,970
   

838
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,020
♫  I have to give back  ♫

839
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,520
♫  If you take one last step  ♫
