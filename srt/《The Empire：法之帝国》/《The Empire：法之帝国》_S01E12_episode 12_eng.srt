1
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:02,258
   

2
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:04,918
So Yoon Gu Ryeong was arrested.

3
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:07,126
He has always been a bit off, right?

4
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:10,896
Even I have heard of him. That explains everything.

5
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:14,706
He abused animals and threatened a woman with a weapon.

6
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,927
My goodness.

7
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:19,103
I need your involvement.

8
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,346
- Pardon? 
 - We should voice our opinions

9
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,876
regarding Yoon Gu Ryeong's case.

10
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:27,180
I need your expertise with the press.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,056
Mention what you have observed about Yoon Gu Ryeong,

12
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,377
and wrap this up.

13
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,217
The school will call for a disciplinary committee soon.

14
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:39,127
A disciplinary committee?

15
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:42,227
They are just investigating him. Shouldn't we wait for a bit longer?

16
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:45,007
You shouldn't be just sitting there twiddling your thumbs!

17
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:51,516
I know that Kang Baek isn't your biological son.

18
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,727
Even so, something else must keep you busy now.

19
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,758
We should end it here.

20
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,877
There are no security cameras.

21
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,517
Given no one has come forward, there are no witnesses yet.

22
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,557
I'm saying this for your sake for the first time.

23
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:17,390
   

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:25,020



25
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,484
   

26
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:30,719
   

27
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,966
Over there.

28
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:40,857
What is this?

29
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,662
What?

30
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:48,453
Wait. What are you doing?

31
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:51,197
Everyone, stop. We're from Central District Prosecutors' Office.

32
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:53,567
Step back, and leave the files there.

33
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:57,137
We're going to record everything, so don't even touch the files.

34
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:59,277
What do you think you're doing?

35
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:01,806
How dare you barge in here in the middle of the night?

36
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,206
Get the files.

37
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,855
Wait. Stop!

38
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,116
I want to see the warrant.

39
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,287
Are you really from the Prosecutors' Office?

40
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,616
You can't seize the files without a warrant. That's illegal.

41
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,157
What do you think you're doing?

42
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:16,486
Mirandize him and arrest him.

43
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,370
Hey.

44
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:22,532
He's the CEO of Jusung.

45
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,336
Don't you know where you are? How dare you?

46
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,037
We know we're at Jusung,

47
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:31,837
but I'm also flustered to see the CEO in the office.

48
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:35,846
All right. You're under arrest for destroying evidence,

49
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:39,016
a violation of Article 155 of the Criminal Code.

50
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:42,347
You're trying to destroy, hide, forge, and fabricate evidence

51
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:46,387
in someone else's criminal or disciplinary case.

52
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:49,106
No. This is absurd.

53
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,327
You got it all wrong!

54
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,857
Are you sure these files aren't

55
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:56,281
about the vice chairman's illegal succession of Jusung?

56
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,466
Listen.

57
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:03,906
So this isn't evidence for someone else's case, but your own criminal case?

58
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:08,937
Yes. That will be plausible if you were involved in this illegal succession.

59
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,603
Did I get that right?

60
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,626
   

61
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,827
What on earth is this? What is she doing?

62
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,466
This makes no sense!

63
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,047
What on earth... What?

64
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,936
Darn it!

65
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,077
You! Darn you!

66
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,897
What on earth...

67
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,506
What? There's no law in Korea?

68
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,977
How can a prosecutor ignore the law?

69
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:47,665
We're not some thugs here!

70
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:51,687
She barged into a company without a warrant in the middle of the night!

71
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:55,771
On top of that, she arrested the executives and raided the office!

72
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,627
She'll file for the warrant after the arrest.

73
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,736
What?

74
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:11,937
She'll request the warrant after raiding the office first?

75
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,437
That makes no sense!

76
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:16,657
This crazy witch thinks the law is a joke!

77
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,939
That's the law.

78
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,866
What are you talking about?

79
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,117
She raided the office without a warrant,

80
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:26,656
and filing a warrant afterward is the law?

81
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:27,837
You must be out of your mind!

82
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:33,456
Hey! Are you here to represent your crazy ex-wife?

83
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:37,396
Have you been doing drugs because you can't handle this sober?

84
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,932
Raiding the office wasn't the goal.

85
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:45,737
If she was planning to catch them red-handed, destroying evidence,

86
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:48,540
the law would be on her side.

87
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,722
You.

88
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,636
You know what?

89
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:05,277
This will be deemed illegally obtained evidence. Darn it.

90
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,497
When the investigative agency was exercising its right,

91
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:11,581
the criminal proceedings were completely ignored.

92
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:15,960
Darn it! She really did it. You!

93
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:20,167
You must make that happen.

94
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,577
Jang Il,

95
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:28,381
we're prosecutors, not Jusung's attorneys.

96
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,732
Do it when I ask nicely.

97
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:37,533
Han Hye Ryul and you

98
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,467
shouldn't be doing this.

99
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:45,111
You better get your son to turn himself in!

100
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,566
And you!

101
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:55,441
If you call me by my name again and drop your honorifics with me,

102
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,607
I'll kill you.

103
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:03,426
How dare you tell me what to do and lecture me? You jerk.

104
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,439
   

105
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,897
   

106
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:18,921
Darn it! Come on. Writing rulings is such a hassle!

107
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,001
   

108
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,037
Yes, Mother.

109
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,699
I see.

110
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:48,396
Yes. I'll check on it.

111
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:52,061
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm really sorry.

112
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,951
Okay.

113
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:12,156
She barged into Jusung and raided the office without a warrant?

114
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,656
How is that possible?

115
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:17,257
Just who does she take after? How could she be so reckless?

116
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:19,726
She must be out of her mind! Who is she trying to arrest?

117
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,526
Be quiet.

118
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,297
Did you get something from Jusung?

119
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,206
What? What do you mean?

120
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,637
My answer is never.

121
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:34,477
Right. I know that. That's not the problem.

122
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:35,807
Right.

123
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:39,476
Let's say that Ham &amp; Lee loses all of its clients.

124
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:44,217
After what our daughter did, we should close down our law firm,

125
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:47,317
but what about your law school?

126
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:50,626
Can Minguk University survive without Jusung's help?

127
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:53,343
Okay. Let's say that's another matter.

128
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,266
What about Kang Baek?

129
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,897
He's being discussed as a suspect in a murder case.

130
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:01,577
Do you think he can survive this?

131
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:03,637
Since when did you care so much about him?

132
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,677
I'm his grandpa.

133
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:08,376
How could she do this without talking to me first?

134
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:10,246
She must not have any faith in you.

135
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,047
What?

136
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:14,107
Don't get involved in Jusung's case.

137
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,616
No. Don't interfere with Hye Ryul's case.

138
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,587
All you care about is Hye Ryul! What on earth are you planning?

139
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,057
This is the last thing we should care about!

140
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:23,137
This is everything now!

141
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:32,116
She needs to go after Jusung in order to reach the highest place in Korea.

142
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:36,374
Are you planning to make Hye Ryul...

143
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:41,734
You want her to become the president, not Na Geun Woo?

144
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:48,546
You and Moo Ryul will not and cannot interfere with Hye Ryul's business.

145
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,653
Keep that in mind.

146
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:51,986
- When will they come out? 
 - Where is she?

147
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,157
   

148
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,828
What?

149
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,850
All right. This is everything.

150
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,067
So they were determined to bury them.

151
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,114
My goodness.

152
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:15,606
No wonder why they wanted to remove the flooring and hide them.

153
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:17,277
Don't miss anything.

154
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:19,216
They came up with an ironclad plan,

155
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,586
so the problem is that there aren't any holes here.

156
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:24,986
Good. Why is that a problem?

157
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:27,117
They're waiting for you to mess up.

158
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:31,624
On top of that, your son...

159
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,387
Prosecutor Oh.

160
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:36,026
Senior, you're amazing.

161
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:40,536
This is why I would jump into a fiery pit if you told me to jump.

162
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,936
I see,

163
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:45,307
so I dragged you into a fiery pit.

164
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:48,177
Well, we barged into Jusung's office and raided their office.

165
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,647
Did you just figure that out?

166
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,047
Sorry about that.

167
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,746
Not only do I make you work late and give you a lot of work,

168
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,146
but I also make you jump into a fiery pit.

169
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,156
I bet you don't even have time to meet your girlfriend.

170
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:03,176
Well, I'm not the only prosecutor with a sad dating life.

171
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:06,956
You don't get to spend time with your husband either.

172
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:09,096
That's why he always comes to your office.

173
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:11,516
Just to see your face for a bit.

174
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,470
Who is it?

175
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:17,807
Professor Na.

176
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,407
You're working pretty late.

177
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:23,707
Well, I knew what I was getting into when I joined her.

178
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,016
I'll go and have a cup of coffee.

179
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,886
I'll give you five minutes. Let's finish this tonight.

180
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,187
Okay.

181
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:34,787
Well, if we don't set an end time, we'll be here forever.

182
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,266
You heard that too, right? You have five minutes.

183
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,480
They might come after you

184
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,286
for illegally obtaining evidence.

185
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,346
On top of that, if people say that you went too far

186
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:04,534
to get information from an insider,

187
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:08,770
the Dolphin incident will resurface and hold you back.

188
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,327
Why are you doing this now without talking to me first?

189
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,450
Are you done?

190
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:18,787
We're not exactly a happy couple who discusses our plans together.

191
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,480
But still, Kang Baek...

192
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,220
Oh, please.

193
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,677
Did you kill her?

194
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,697
What are you talking about?

195
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:36,317
You rushed here to give me advice while pretending

196
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,687
to be concerned about me because you're scared

197
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,287
that something might happen to you.

198
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:44,956
Fortunately for you, it looks like this will get resolved

199
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,765
before anything happens to you.

200
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,790
I heard it from Mom.

201
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,224
Was it Yoon Gu Ryeong?

202
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:57,406
He was reported for stalking her. They were going to request a warrant,

203
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:01,046
and they happened to pick him up for abusing animals.

204
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:03,736
He also threatened a woman with a weapon.

205
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,232
Your five minutes are up. Leave.

206
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:11,259
Well...

207
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,376
It won't be over just yet.

208
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm...

209
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,952
So...

210
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,827
I will represent Yoon Gu Ryeong.

211
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,220
What?

212
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:36,876
What are you talking about?

213
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:40,077
He's my student, and he seems innocent too.

214
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:41,946
You've gone mad!

215
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:43,287
You're out of your mind!

216
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,986
How do you know he is innocent?

217
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,356
Does he have something on you?

218
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:49,756
Did he threaten you?

219
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,241
Gosh.

220
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,696
I got nothing to say to you.

221
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:59,517
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,843
Shut your mouth!

223
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:07,377
Do you know what I'm doing to protect Kang Baek?

224
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:10,097
Do you even know what I'm doing?

225
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:14,547
Despite all of my effort, you're going to represent who?

226
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,026
Are you all right?

227
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,590
Don't come near me!

228
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:27,847
Don't do it.

229
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:32,136
I'm making it clear to you. Don't do it.

230
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:36,453
Don't do it!

231
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,620
Well,

232
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:42,546
I don't think I can get out of it.

233
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,316
I want a divorce.

234
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:49,946
How can this be a shock to you?

235
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:51,646
Are you shocked?

236
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,606
Isn't it only natural that I ask for a divorce?

237
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,196
   

238
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:09,561
   

239
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,807
This is crazy.

240
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:19,731
Is Hye Ryul a genius or a lunatic?

241
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,787
She barged into Jusung without a warrant and obtained evidence?

242
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:25,522
Will this hold up in court?

243
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,956
No. She must have something in mind.

244
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,157
This must hold up in court.

245
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:33,277
And what she has in mind is the problem.

246
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:48,148
My gosh.

247
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:51,246
I wanted to resolve this after I talked to you,

248
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:52,947
so I called for an urgent meeting.

249
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:57,586
- My gosh. What on earth... 
 - But still, it's way too early for a meeting.

250
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,327
Come on.

251
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,586
She just raided Jusung's office,

252
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,756
and the CEO got arrested there.

253
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,027
He removed the flooring.

254
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,190
He was caught red-handed.

255
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,157
Don't you agree?

256
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,787
He will be in a tight spot.

257
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,356
It wasn't like he was hiding his journal down there.

258
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:24,077
So whether he removed the flooring or the ceiling, you can challenge her action in court.

259
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:27,017
Moreover, she must have an insider's help to pull this off.

260
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:30,686
Yes. Did you handle what I told you to earlier?

261
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:31,887
Is that so?

262
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,663
Okay. I'll be there soon.

263
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,027
So what is it that you want to tell us?

264
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,083
Listen.

265
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:46,647
Sir, am I to understand that you're okay

266
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,116
with Jusung's investigation going forward?

267
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,466
This isn't...

268
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:55,106
You said as long as Jusung's investigation went well,

269
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,477
you would nominate me for the next general election.

270
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:59,447
Jusung needs to learn their lesson at times like this.

271
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:03,147
Don't you know the world we live in? This isn't some joke.

272
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,186
That was really low.

273
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:07,842
How could they remove the flooring?

274
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,086
I have some government affairs to handle.

275
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,834
Why are you wasting my morning? I'm leaving!

276
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:18,035
Wait. What?

277
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,382
Am I the only one

278
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,247
who finds this odd?

279
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,977
If something happens to Jusung, a new administration will take over,

280
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:28,007
and our country will be doomed. That's what he told me!

281
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:31,146
You see, I really hate it when people use

282
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:34,616
dogs and excrement in their analogies,

283
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:38,696
but nothing really comes to my mind other than this expression.

284
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:42,326
Do you discuss with people before you take a dump?

285
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,107
I have news to prepare. I'll get going too.

286
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,748
The truth will come out, so let's make this easy.

287
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:04,577
We can easily unlock your phone. It just takes time.

288
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,247
We have enough evidence,

289
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,946
and we arrested you at the scene too.

290
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:10,946
What's the point in denying the charges?

291
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,987
Nowadays, cell phones are more than just objects.

292
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:16,057
They are an extension of our body part.

293
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,726
It contains a lot of information even the owner forgets about.

294
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,297
There may be information that can help your investigation,

295
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:24,466
but there's sensitive information that has nothing to do with the case.

296
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:28,320
How will you distinguish the two and take only the necessary information?

297
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:33,106
My client will admit to violating the Animal Protection Act

298
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:36,747
and the Wildlife Protection Act on November 2, 2022 at 10 p.m.

299
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:39,277
You took the iron pipe from him at the scene,

300
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:42,286
so he can't destroy the evidence even if he wants to.

301
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:45,287
Given the ratio of stay of prosecution and imprisonment for violation of the Animal Protection Act,

302
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,886
and given his educational background being a law student,

303
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,126
I don't see any reason for him to flee.

304
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,896
Do you think you will get a warrant to detain him?

305
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:57,267
He'll either get a stay of prosecution or a summary order.

306
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,436
You still think you're a judge.

307
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:01,037
You have your ruling ready.

308
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:04,436
A prosecutor will decide on the stay of prosecution or the summary order.

309
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:07,231
It won't even reach the judge's desk.

310
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,507
This isn't a simple animal abuse case.

311
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:13,691
You know what happened at the lake.

312
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:17,517
I thought Ms. Hong was your student too.

313
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,486
Actually, I would like to discuss that with you.

314
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:26,626
As he admitted, he killed a cat.

315
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,497
The victim who saw him screamed.

316
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,666
My client was trying to calm the victim down,

317
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:35,470
so he showed the dead cat and said this.

318
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,567
"Be quiet. It's just a cat."

319
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,807
"The cat was so loud,

320
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:42,654
so I silenced it."

321
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,877
No one will calm down after hearing that.

322
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,346
"I'll silence you too. I'll kill you." It sounds like a threat!

323
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,987
That's a subjective interpretation.

324
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:54,787
My client didn't specify what he would do to the victim.

325
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,327
However, the victim was frightened and asked him not to kill her,

326
00:18:57,327 --> 00:19:02,327
but the suspect told her to be quiet because she was loud too.

327
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,227
He said, "You're so loud."

328
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,151
"Everyone is so loud."

329
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,506
That's what he said.

330
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:12,936
"You're loud too." Weren't you implying that you were going to kill her

331
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:17,385
just like the noisy cat you silenced by killing it?

332
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:22,406
How is it now? Is it loud here?

333
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:27,087
It's loud here.

334
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,414
Who is loud?

335
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,527
   

336
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,613
What do you say?

337
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,246
Did he just forewarn a murder attempt?

338
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,516
He says everything, including me, is loud to him.

339
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,457
This is a different case.

340
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:02,457
He's very sensitive to noises due to his tinnitus.

341
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:04,687
He just wanted to tell them to be quiet.

342
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,526
Sir, he held an iron pipe.

343
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:10,427
Even if he didn't specify, he possessed a weapon!

344
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,597
He was so flustered that he didn't think of putting it down.

345
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:17,707
He was holding it even before he met the victim.

346
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,137
You know how a weapon possessed coincidentally

347
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,545
is considered in a special blackmail case.

348
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:29,101
Detective Wang Joong Jin, during the suspect's interrogation,

349
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:32,387
you said, "Consider yourself lucky you're not here for attempted murder."

350
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:34,486
"You killed a cat with an iron pipe."

351
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,127
"You killed Hong Nan Hee."

352
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:39,147
"You were going to kill another woman with it."

353
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:41,876
Is this correct?

354
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:44,726
"Investigate a case quickly without forejudging or prejudice."

355
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,797
"Do not have any preconceived ideas in the progress."

356
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,707
"Refrain from making groundless assumptions."

357
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,336
"Do not be overconfident with testimonies that are made."

358
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:54,507
"Do not force anyone to confess or testify

359
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:59,914
with evidence or materials secured through another investigation."

360
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:03,557
Isn't this the basic principle of investigation?

361
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:08,017
According to your remarks, it seems very clear

362
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,557
that you're keeping him here for a different investigation,

363
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:13,240
regardless of his suspicion.

364
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:17,357
Will you release him now?

365
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:20,936
Or should we take this to the hearing Inspection Committee?

366
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,577
   

367
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,137
Why are you standing like that?

368
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:31,746
Look, Senior.

369
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:36,117
Not now. Ask for me when we have Jusung's vice chairman.

370
00:21:36,117 --> 00:21:38,451
When is he coming?

371
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:40,295
Well, that...

372
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,541
seems unlikely.

373
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,500
What?

374
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,954
It's not going to work.

375
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,227
Why?

376
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:51,527
We shouldn't keep messing with Jusung now.

377
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,850
So why?

378
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,367
Tell me.

379
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,307
You once said that an investigation must take place

380
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:03,477
with the flow of public sentiments, like riding the waves.

381
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:06,780
- Otherwise—
 - We will sink in the water.

382
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,117
Are you saying people will want us to summon Kang Baek first

383
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:13,217
before Jusung's vice chairman?

384
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:15,592
That's right.

385
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:20,526
He can just be investigated as a testifier, but why do you keep postponing it?

386
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:23,800
It will only worsen the public sentiments.

387
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:29,924
Do people think of him simply as a testifier?

388
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:34,042
Tell me. Haven't they branded him already?

389
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,685
They won't listen to whatever is said.

390
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:41,046
Should I let them drag Kang Baek around as they want?

391
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,446
And gossip about whether the police interviewed him,

392
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:47,699
used a lie detector, or did a hypnotic investigation on him?

393
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,327
Let me make it easy for you.

394
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:54,747
Prosecutor Oh, say your relationship with Ms. Yoon is reported on the news one day.

395
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:56,627
"A prosecutor of the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

396
00:22:56,627 --> 00:23:01,739
has been leaking case information to his reporter girlfriend."

397
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:04,837
"Her ex turns out to be another prosecutor."

398
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:06,036
"She's fond of dating prosecutors."

399
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:10,548
Such groundless rumors are added to the story.

400
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:13,876
Ms. Yoon becomes a crazy woman overnight,

401
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:17,916
and people call you an idiot. How will you handle it?

402
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:22,585
No, do you think you can handle it?

403
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:25,596
Ms. Yoon will probably suffer from a mental breakdown.

404
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:32,696
Will you force her to prove her innocence as those people want?

405
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:37,507
If I were in her shoes and my boyfriend forced me,

406
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:39,743
I would...

407
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:42,686
want to kill myself.

408
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:46,217
We have clear evidence on Jusung.

409
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,416
We will investigate the case according to the suspicions,

410
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,552
and I will...

411
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:53,530
protect my son

412
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,016
from this ridiculous mess.

413
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,656
   

414
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:04,267
There he is!

415
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,837
- He's coming out! 
 - There he is!

416
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,667
- He's coming out! 
 - Gosh!

417
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,175
He's here!

418
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:15,577
Weren't you too hasty at specifying the suspect?

419
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,847
Why aren't you summoning Han Kang Baek?

420
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,417
Wasn't there external pressure?

421
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,077
Is it true that he stalked the victim?

422
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,016
Are you releasing him because he's no longer a suspect?

423
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,486
You didn't kill the cat, did you? Was it fabricated?

424
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,457
You killed Hong Nan Hee, didn't you?

425
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:31,057
You're watching the shameful reality of the Korean police!

426
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:33,357
If you feel wronged, say something!

427
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:38,296
I'm innocent!

428
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,381
Help me!

429
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:42,367
He says he's innocent!

430
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:43,966
- Did you hear him? 
 - He says he's innocent!

431
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,836
   

432
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:49,496
Professor Na Geun Woo

433
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:53,258
knows that I'm innocent!

434
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,384
He's my defense attorney!

435
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:59,257
   

436
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:01,816
Professor Na!

437
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:03,987
Professor Na!

438
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:05,387
It's Na Geun Woo!

439
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:07,830
Na Geun Woo is here!

440
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:10,397
Is it true you're his defense attorney?

441
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:12,196
Is your son the murderer?

442
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:14,167
You're indeed a righteous judicial officer!

443
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,736
- Say a word... 
 - Where are you...

444
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:17,466
- About your son's involvement. 
 - Where are you hiding your son?

445
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,407
Where is Han Kang Baek?

446
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:22,006
How is your son doing?

447
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:23,746
- Professor Na! 
 - Wait!

448
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:25,077
- Professor Na! 
 - Where are you hiding him?

449
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,501
- Just a moment! 
 - Wait!

450
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,747
Professor Na!

451
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,417
   

452
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:34,997
- Mr. Na! 
 - Han Kang Baek is the culprit!

453
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:43,796
 People have been protesting for days for the police to change 

454
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,467
 the Minguk University murder case into an open investigation 

455
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,537
 and to investigate Han Kang Baek, 

456
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:50,866
 Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul's son, as the culprit. 

457
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,719
 However, the opposing protest is growing as well. 

458
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,973
Oh, geez!

459
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,390
   

460
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:13,959
 You want me to hire someone who can commit murder on your behalf? 

461
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:18,855
 Honestly, it's not too hard. 

462
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:22,877
 If then, 

463
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:26,052
 how will it benefit me? 

464
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:30,176
 Since you got the sentence, 

465
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:33,977
 you're bored without any visitations from your butler lawyers. 

466
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,416
 - That's right. 
 - And you still have a backache. 

467
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,917
 Don't get me started. 

468
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,336
 The pain's horrible whenever it rains. 

469
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:42,856
 What about it? 

470
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:48,097
 Will the prosecution let me get a massage or something? 

471
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:50,117
 It's much better than that. 

472
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:51,938
 Call girls? 

473
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:57,936
 I will help you 

474
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,850
 leave this prison. 

475
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,456
 Really? 

476
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,686
- Hey, comments boy.
 - Yes?

477
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:21,596
- When are you getting discharged?
 - March next year, sir.

478
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:25,067
Goodness, that's a long time.

479
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:28,336
Too bad. I might leave this place before you do.

480
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:32,401
But you are...

481
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:36,881
This is driving me crazy.

482
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:17,595
It's stupid,

483
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,687
but whenever I try to talk to the mother, we end up arguing.

484
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:24,815
Hye Ryul gets angry only for a good reason,

485
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:26,511
and...

486
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:30,881
it's unpleasant to hear you call her "the mother".

487
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,470
I see.

488
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,667
How should I address her then?

489
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,758
How about "my ex"?

490
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,883
She has a name,

491
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,246
and she made an accomplishment with her name,

492
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,866
so "Hye Ryul" or "Prosecutor Han"

493
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,877
should suffice.

494
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,489
I see,

495
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:55,216
but today, I'm here to talk about the family, not work.

496
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,425
About Kang Baek.

497
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:02,460
I expected so.

498
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:06,262
He's in a bad situation.

499
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:10,894
Prosecutor Han has a lot of allies and enemies at the same time.

500
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:15,007
I bet you're aware of it, so why did you do that?

501
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:18,173
That boy named Gu Ryeong.

502
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,203
Why did you defend him?

503
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:25,646
You worked hard as if your life depended on it and even had him released.

504
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:28,645
A small case snowballed too much.

505
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:32,197
The media is going rampant,

506
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:36,177
thanks to you, Professor Na.

507
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:42,640
Now that we've lost the last chance to handle it quietly,

508
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,890
the mess has to be cleaned up by the one who created it.

509
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:48,990
I'd say his mother... I mean,

510
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,046
Prosecutor Han was unlucky with her husband,

511
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:54,747
but you shouldn't cause damage to Kang Baek.

512
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:57,617
I'm doing all I can to protect him.

513
00:29:57,617 --> 00:29:59,700
All you can?

514
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,486
You make calculations to do what's good for everyone.

515
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,226
Do you call that "doing all you can"?

516
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:08,426
You can say that when you do what's best for Kang Baek.

517
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:11,696
At least, it's the case for me and Hye Ryul.

518
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:15,137
That's the only thing we have in common.

519
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:19,592
That's why I let my son stay with the Han family.

520
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:23,346
I get what you mean,

521
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:27,887
but I'm his father too.

522
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:32,410
I'm well aware of what I must do for him.

523
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,016
If you'd considered yourself as his father,

524
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:38,256
you wouldn't have played a star attorney like some hero.

525
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,726
Is the presidential approval rating that important to you?

526
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:43,366
Is that why you chose a just and righteous reputation over Kang Baek?

527
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:46,023
I think you're mistaken!

528
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,407
I didn't want this to go public.

529
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:51,447
This never...

530
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:53,606
Say that nonsense on TV.

531
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:57,194
I don't buy you, nor do I want to.

532
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:59,422
Show me the result.

533
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,585
Make someone a culprit

534
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,928
instead of Kang Baek.

535
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:15,305
I came all the way here to tell you this

536
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:17,752
only for one reason.

537
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,256
Kang Baek

538
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,950
is fond of you.

539
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:28,631
He's very fond of you.

540
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,404
I could tell.

541
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:32,506
He's fond of you, but he acted like he wasn't

542
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,991
in case I'd be disappointed.

543
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,451
You know about his nature.

544
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,356
He's constantly anxious and worried

545
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:44,976
that he might hurt anyone's feelings.

546
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:47,516
He likes people.

547
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,311
So,

548
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:54,930
he considers you as his father too.

549
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,522
Make a fatherly decision.

550
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:04,429
   

551
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:22,210
 Will you be my father now? 

552
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:25,366
 That's right. I hope we get along. 

553
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:27,947
 I also hope we get along, 

554
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,487
 and please take good care of Mom. 

555
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,082
 Why are you chuckling? 

556
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:38,647
 Well, because you're very smart. 

557
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:42,183
 Is that a funny thing? 

558
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:48,856
 Well, your mom seems just too strong 

559
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:51,457
 that I feel like she doesn't need me to take care of her. 

560
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,156
 This thought made me chuckle. 

561
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:57,470
 Mom isn't a strong woman. 

562
00:32:58,108 --> 00:32:59,596
 Is she not? 

563
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:02,756
 She's lonely sometimes. 

564
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,514
 Really? 

565
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:09,940
 What is being lonely? 

566
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,517
 It's like being constantly alone. 

567
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:18,946
 You feel like you're alone even when you are around people. 

568
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:21,394
 It's very sad, 

569
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:26,896
 but she doesn't seem lonely when she's with you. 

570
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:30,361
 So I like you. 

571
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:38,506
 Dear parents and guests who came here despite your busy schedule, 

572
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,977
 and teachers who prepared for our graduation with blessings, 

573
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:45,616
 I'd like to give thanks to you all. 

574
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,958
 My dear graduates, 

575
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,247
 we're now getting ready to take a new step 

576
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:53,834
 as adults with our youth behind. 

577
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,486
 The encouraging principal, 

578
00:33:56,486 --> 00:33:58,790
 the kind vice principal, 

579
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,796
 and the teachers who educated us, the foolish students, 

580
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:04,666
 with great lessons and warm embraces. 

581
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,637
 - The loving juniors... 
 - Are you crying, honey? 

582
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:10,906
 - No. 
 - And the guests who came here to congratulate us today. 

583
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,158
 You are crying. 

584
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:15,786
 This isn't something to cry over. 

585
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,327
 He... 

586
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:21,216
 Our Kang Baek grew up in an instant. 

587
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:24,046
 We should congratulate him for becoming an adult. 

588
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:25,587
 There's no need to cry. 

589
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:29,187
 Time went by too fast. 

590
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:31,627
 There's still so much I couldn't do for him. 

591
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:35,026
 He will eventually ask for me less. 

592
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:36,367
 ...the athletic meets. 

593
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,827
 Everything is precious and beautiful memories. 

594
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,838
 We raised him well. 

595
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,209
 Our Kang Baek grew up well. 

596
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,977
 I better film this... so I can play it later at his wedding. 

597
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:50,807
 Stop it. Film Kang Baek instead. 

598
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:52,794
 Then again, 

599
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,677
 you're crying even now. 

600
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,986
 I bet you'll cry your eyes out at his wedding. 

601
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,947
 I should film you again then. 

602
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:05,386
   

603
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:12,066
 Next, the honor students will be awarded. 

604
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:15,636
 If your names are called, please come up to the stage. 

605
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,037
 Dad, here. 

606
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:20,385
 Gosh, I'm not crying. 

607
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:23,106
 I'm not sure if I should give it to him today. 

608
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,776
 - Me neither. 
 - What do you mean? 

609
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:27,877
 Class 3, Seo Moon Jung. 

610
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,829
 Class 1, Kim Eun Joo. 

611
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,071
 I'm sorry it took too long. 

612
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:50,407
 Please, be my legal father too now. 

613
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:06,053
 Gosh. 

614
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,907
   

615
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:28,463
Why wouldn't he pick up?

616
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,136
Mr. Ahn.

617
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,756
It's not easy to reach you.

618
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:45,557
You must be going through a lot.

619
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:48,497
Are you kidding me, Ms. Ham?

620
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,197
Pardon?

621
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,566
No, what do you mean?

622
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:55,736
If not, how could you do that?

623
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:58,767
 Na Geun Woo's action is different from your request. 

624
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,591
I had no idea.

625
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:06,816
I was so shocked that I kept trying to reach you, but I couldn't.

626
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:10,017
Forget it! Let's just call everything off.

627
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,946
What about the scholarship?

628
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,457
It's all prepared.

629
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:15,753
 I said, forget it! 

630
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:16,787
 I don't care anymore. 

631
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:19,426
Given the situation, taking Ham &amp; Lee's scholarship

632
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,657
will almost obviously cause trouble.

633
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,026
 You are not on the same page even with your family, 

634
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:26,537
 so what can I possibly get out of getting involved? 

635
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,796
Such a thing will never happen again.

636
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:31,267
You can count on me.

637
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,867
Instead of using your time to call me,

638
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:35,647
focus on keeping your family under control,

639
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:39,745
and stop calling my personal number!

640
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:42,417
Mr. Ahn!

641
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:48,282
Gosh, that lost my appetite.

642
00:37:49,287 --> 00:37:51,891
What a complicated family.

643
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,897
Aren't you even mad?

644
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:59,397
Phone calls may seem like nothing, but they can eventually be my burden.

645
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:02,345
I got involved for nothing.

646
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,606
Did you say the scholarship was five million dollars?

647
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,206
Yes.

648
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:09,436
It's at least 50 million dollars.

649
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:10,247
What?

650
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,610
Ham &amp; Lee can finance that much money with no problem.

651
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,687
They're hiding a fortune in borrowed-name accounts.

652
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,787
Their case is much better than conglomerates,

653
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:21,416
whose money is all tied in stocks

654
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,361
due to management succession issues.

655
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,227
You know that family's ancestors were pro-Japanese, right?

656
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:29,282
I heard so.

657
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:33,136
After the national liberation, they managed to seize

658
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:36,676
all the properties that the Japanese left behind.

659
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:40,107
About 30 years ago, Ham Min Heon's older sister

660
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:41,937
got arrested for embezzlement.

661
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:46,816
It's widely accepted that he sent his sister to prison

662
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:50,257
to siphon all the fortune away in the meantime.

663
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,816
He may be crazy about money, but she is his blood-related sister.

664
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,057
Geez.

665
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:59,201
That family sure is sickening.

666
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,457
It must be what she experienced in the family

667
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,827
that makes Han Hye Ryul so eager to take her younger sister down.

668
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:06,937
Anyway, our best move is to watch how the situation goes

669
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:11,537
and side with whoever survives it.

670
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:13,178
Oh, right.

671
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:17,820
I thought you owed Jusung a lot.

672
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,417
Who said that?

673
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,247
Goodness.

674
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:23,886
Who knows?

675
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,386
It was five million dollars this time,

676
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:30,767
but it may be 10 or 20 million dollars next time.

677
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:32,792
Cheers.

678
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,897
Na Geun Woo, this son of a gun.

679
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:53,094
I will kill him.

680
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:56,613
I'm going to kill him.

681
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:02,716
Hey, Han Hye Ryul!

682
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:06,215
- Ms. Han! 
 - Ms. Yang.

683
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:09,395
I'm here to have a conversation.

684
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:12,827
I'm a part of this family. This is my parents' house,

685
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,136
so don't act like I shouldn't be here. It's upsetting.

686
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:19,137
I cannot visit her in the Prosecutors' Office,

687
00:40:19,137 --> 00:40:22,337
so I'm here at home to have a family talk.

688
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,109
Is it that serious of a problem?

689
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,113
I'll get you some tea.

690
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,796
I guess you're embarrassed, after all.

691
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:45,026
I've warned you several times not to barge into my office.

692
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:49,237
And I've warned you several times not to mess with my family.

693
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:53,607
If you keep this up, I'll have to resort to tougher measures.

694
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:57,006
"She's going easy on her own family." I don't want to hear people say that.

695
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:59,917
What's wrong with going a little easy on your family?

696
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,017
Aren't you cooking up this ruse to let Kang Baek off the hook?

697
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:07,246
I am not cooking up a ruse. I am simply investigating the case as planned.

698
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:10,957
Combing through Jusung's head office was a part of the plan too?

699
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:13,057
The plan is to investigate the case thoroughly.

700
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:15,644
You've lost your mind.

701
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:19,566
Have you gone mad because your husband's mistress wanted to marry your son?

702
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:24,019
Or is it because your son is now a suspect in her murder?

703
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,537
What is it that you want to say?

704
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:30,276
So have you found the ring?

705
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:36,597
I have no reason to explain any of this to you,

706
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,596
but Kang Baek and Hong Nan Hee...

707
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:41,586
They didn't have that kind of relationship.

708
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:45,927
But he introduced her to me as his "girlfriend".

709
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:51,802
Kids these days casually date and break up.

710
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,997
Kang Baek is different from such kids,

711
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:58,937
and like I said, I clearly saw him buying a ring.

712
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:02,837
Kang Ye's birthday is coming up. I'm sure he was buying a gift for Kang Ye's birthday.

713
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:03,917
Okay, sure.

714
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:08,289
Keep on believing that, but you know,

715
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:12,867
no matter what you believe,

716
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:17,494
Kang Baek will not be ruled out as a suspect

717
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,657
until the thing involving my husband is all sorted out.

718
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,540
Oh, where is Geun Woo?

719
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:37,346
He defended the new suspect and got him released.

720
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,047
He surely contributed to further complicating the situation

721
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:44,747
so that people wouldn't get bored with the investigation on Jusung.

722
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:47,910
I wanted to thank him for all of this, but he's not at home.

723
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,910
I can't even reach him.

724
00:42:52,057 --> 00:42:56,296
To thank Professor Na for what he did,

725
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:58,816
I shall give you another chance,

726
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:00,196
but you'd better stop here

727
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:04,241
or I'll let the bomb go off, and we'll all die together.

728
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:09,283
Professor Na knows what I have, so you can ask him directly.

729
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:43,990
♫   Someone reflected weakly on the window   ♫

730
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:52,120
♫   Who could that person watching me be?   ♫

731
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,620
♫   Even if I ask multiple times   ♫

732
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,260
♫   They just mirror the shape of my lips   ♫

733
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,690
♫   Just a sad, mysterious smile   ♫

734
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,157
 I know men like him too well. 

735
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:11,508
 They approach you with a goal, and once you give them what they want, 

736
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:14,855
 they look elsewhere right away. 

737
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,807
 "It's suffocating. I need to be comforted." 

738
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:21,276
 They come up with absurd excuses to justify their action. 

739
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:27,047
 As time passes by, they lose any sense of shame, humiliation, or gratitude. 

740
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:30,217
 You've gone mad! You're out of your mind! 

741
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,926
 How do you know he is innocent? 

742
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:36,667
 Does he have something on you? Did he threaten you? 

743
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,839
 Kang Baek 

744
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:41,466
 is fond of you. 

745
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:44,714
 He considers you as his father too. 

746
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,130
 Make a fatherly decision. 

747
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,890
♫   Let go of regrets   ♫

748
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,583
Mom.

749
00:44:55,216 --> 00:44:56,953
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:58,346 --> 00:45:03,500
I really can't face you.

751
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,330
I'm too ashamed to face you.

752
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:12,220
♫   The love that I missed   ♫

753
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,400
♫   I hope it blooms again in that place  ♫

754
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,077
- You idiot! Get up. 
 - Father!

755
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:22,877
Why are you being like this?

756
00:45:22,877 --> 00:45:25,107
Why? You know why! I clearly told you

757
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:27,076
to protect Kang Baek at all costs!

758
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,017
I am trying! I really am,

759
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,546
but you see, times have changed.

760
00:45:31,546 --> 00:45:33,386
There are some things that just can't be done.

761
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:36,687
Besides, Na Geun Woo is acting up. What am I supposed to do?

762
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:39,014
What? You idiot!

763
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:41,361
You killed her, didn't you?

764
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,327
You met her that day!

765
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,867
What on earth are you talking about?

766
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:48,396
Should I prove why you had to meet that girl?

767
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:51,037
Should I go ahead and prove why you had to kill her?

768
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:52,767
That won't benefit Ham &amp; Lee in any way.

769
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,907
What? How dare you use Ham &amp; Lee to threaten me?

770
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:57,046
Fine, I'll do it!

771
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,907
If it must be done to take you down, I will destroy Ham &amp; Lee at once!

772
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,346
Father!

773
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:05,247
The moment you desert Kang Baek, you'll become a suspect too.

774
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:06,830
Don't forget that!

775
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,986
Why treat this moron nicely?

776
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:10,727
Honey, that's enough.

777
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:13,103
You scumbag!

778
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:22,356
Did you meet her that day?

779
00:46:22,356 --> 00:46:26,228
Why? Are you excited, thinking you've now got something on me?

780
00:46:26,228 --> 00:46:28,736
What about you, then? Where were you on that day?

781
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:30,977
Did you think I wouldn't know what you were up to?

782
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:35,420
Can you say you had no reason to kill her? Can you?

783
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:11,116
- That's Yoon Gu Ryeong. 
 - Oh, he's here?

784
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:16,357
 Guys, not everyone who gets into a law school becomes a judge, prosecutor, or lawyer. 

785
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:19,386
Look at this guy. Yoon Gu Ryeong.

786
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:23,178
He kept on failing the national judicial exam,

787
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,794
then the exam itself was abolished,

788
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:28,470
but he still won't give up.

789
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:34,055
That perseverance and determination. It's truly inspiring.

790
00:47:34,055 --> 00:47:36,577
So he finally managed to get into Minguk University,

791
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:39,176
but what's the point?

792
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:43,547
Look at the mess he's in now. Oh, he's running away!

793
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,035
Goodness. This is nuts.

794
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:53,597
Let me take attendance first.

795
00:47:53,597 --> 00:47:55,816
- Hyun Seo A. 
 - Yes.

796
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:57,968
- Woo Yong Hee. 
 - Yes.

797
00:47:57,968 --> 00:47:59,974
Lee Ah Jeong.

798
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:04,972
Jeong Kyung Yoon.

799
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:10,513
All right.

800
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:15,071
Not here again? Okay.

801
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,316
Open your book.

802
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:19,477
   

803
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:24,614
   

804
00:48:30,197 --> 00:48:31,796
   

805
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:33,896
   

806
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:43,006
All right. A killed B after an argument

807
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:46,877
and abandoned B's corpse to cover up the crime.

808
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:48,946
Someone convicted of murder can be sentenced

809
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:53,116
to death, life imprisonment, or at least five years in jail.

810
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,686
Abandonment of a corpse is punishable by less than seven years in prison.

811
00:48:56,686 --> 00:49:01,717
Then what is the maximum sentence that A can receive?

812
00:49:20,817 --> 00:49:24,296
I'm going to marry Kang Baek.

813
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:26,022
What?

814
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,548
I figured I should give you a heads-up.

815
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:34,050
Hold on. I don't get it.

816
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,444
You're going to marry Kang Baek?

817
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:39,197
Yes.

818
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:43,373
Why?

819
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:45,749
Did he propose to you?

820
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,684
I'm sorry.

821
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:54,447
Kang Baek needs me now.

822
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:00,857
In the court of public opinion, he's already guilty.

823
00:50:00,857 --> 00:50:02,857
Why must you choose that difficult path?

824
00:50:02,857 --> 00:50:06,733
It's fine! I know him better than anybody else does.

825
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,589
It wasn't him.

826
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:13,786
I know that, so it's fine.

827
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:16,645
Ji Yi!

828
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,983
What do you know?

829
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:24,551
You know nothing about Kang Baek.

830
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:30,566
Just come to me.

831
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:32,446
Hey, I told you we weren't right for each other.

832
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,086
Unlike Kang Baek, I will never hurt you or make you cry.

833
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:38,227
Also,

834
00:50:38,227 --> 00:50:42,423
you may think I'm pathetic, but I'm not such a loser.

835
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:45,066
My father...

836
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:47,603
Your late father?

837
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:55,869
Yes.

838
00:50:55,869 --> 00:51:00,366
He passed away but he was meant to...

839
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:02,189
I mean,

840
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:05,526
he left a lot for me.

841
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:19,567
Nice to meet you.

842
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,897
Thank you for responding to a sudden invitation.

843
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:27,525
No, thank you for inviting me.

844
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:31,949
I was worried about Kang Baek too.

845
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:34,196
You were?

846
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:38,497
Everyone tends to avoid him in times like this.

847
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:41,977
The flowers are nice in the garden.

848
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,587
Help Kang Baek see the sun and walk.

849
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:48,215
He won't leave his room.

850
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:55,296
I'm worried about him.

851
00:51:55,966 --> 00:52:00,695
Is he not coming out even though I'm here?

852
00:52:00,695 --> 00:52:03,357
I'll persuade him.

853
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:07,505
He won't turn his friend away.

854
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,247
Please wait here.

855
00:52:09,247 --> 00:52:11,910
Yes. Thank you.

856
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:18,756
Of all people, Kyung Yoon is here.

857
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:20,997
 He's here because he's worried about his friend. 

858
00:52:20,997 --> 00:52:23,329
 You should meet him. 

859
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:32,067
You should come out and see him, even just for a second.

860
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:36,019
That will make you feel...

861
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:45,749
Kang Baek, it's your great-grandma.

862
00:52:48,187 --> 00:52:51,722
It sounds ridiculous to me too.

863
00:52:51,722 --> 00:52:54,457
Anyone would laugh at it. I know that.

864
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:59,105
How will other people think even when I know it?

865
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:02,897
I'm not a fool.

866
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,780
I know

867
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,037
what this family and the world think of me,

868
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:17,066
but you didn't treat me like that.

869
00:53:17,066 --> 00:53:21,131
I know that. How can I not?

870
00:53:22,386 --> 00:53:26,087
You always checked my spot and place for me,

871
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:32,094
in case I was isolated and discouraged.

872
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:39,409
Thanks to you and your care,

873
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:43,511
I was able to endure it.

874
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:50,419
I always wanted to thank you for that,

875
00:53:50,419 --> 00:53:53,094
but I was too shy.

876
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:57,170
Kang Baek.

877
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:01,836
Lately,

878
00:54:02,957 --> 00:54:10,144
it breaks my heart to see you in pain.

879
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:16,110
Do you want me to be honest?

880
00:54:16,877 --> 00:54:23,160
I always wished for your happiness.

881
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:27,347
Kang Baek,

882
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:31,641
will you do me a favor?

883
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:35,090
I don't mean anything in this house.

884
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:40,896
Will you give me a chance to show off to your mother and grandmother?

885
00:54:40,896 --> 00:54:44,109
That you left your room today

886
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:47,977
and you went out for a walk with Kyung Yoon and had snacks.

887
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:51,133
That I achieved something so great.

888
00:54:53,276 --> 00:55:00,316
Will you let your great-grandma take this opportunity to condescend?

889
00:55:01,787 --> 00:55:05,006
For your great-grandma.

890
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:26,547
Thank you! Thank you so much!

891
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:28,986
Thank you so much!

892
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:33,358
Kang Baek,

893
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:37,813
I will never forget your kindness.

894
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,624
You're a good person.

895
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:46,057
You're good-natured,

896
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:52,172
and I always felt bad for you.

897
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:07,816
He has been waiting for you in the garden.

898
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:10,020
Thank you.

899
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:26,622
You will be able to take credit for that.

900
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:32,108
Don't you act up. How dare you?

901
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:34,892
Do I look funny to you?

902
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,564
No matter how much you act up, you're no match to me.

903
00:56:39,287 --> 00:56:41,359
Butler Yang,

904
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,713
get my great-grandson and his friend some snacks.

905
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,767
 Hey.  
    

906
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:37,307
 I forgot some files in my office. 

907
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:39,731
 I was going to read them tonight, 

908
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:42,696
 so I'll go back and pick them up now. 

909
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:45,717
 I see. 

910
00:57:45,717 --> 00:57:48,326
 Then you should go get them. 

911
00:57:48,326 --> 00:57:50,753
 I won't be long. 

912
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:08,600
   

913
00:58:18,387 --> 00:58:21,142
 Is Kang Baek getting married soon? 

914
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:23,586
 This store is known for its engagement rings. 

915
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:27,050
   

916
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:59,227
 But I can't let you do what you want with my marriage. 

917
00:58:59,227 --> 00:59:00,426
 I'll marry her. 

918
00:59:00,426 --> 00:59:03,802
 Kang Baek and I love each other. 

919
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:06,600
 So accept it, 

920
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,359
 Mother. 

921
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:16,660
 I must end it now. 

922
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:23,150



923
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,390
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

924
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,810
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

925
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,420
   

926
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:38,390
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

927
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,630
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

928
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:48,600
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

929
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,450
♫  It's a game of the tongue  ♫

930
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,600

♫  Like a blooming flower  ♫

934
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,066
 Proceed with your marriage with Ji Yi. 

935
01:00:18,066 --> 01:00:20,455
 It's all over now. 

936
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:22,176
 I hear you wish to get into politics. 

937
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:25,377
 This is the kind of family you're marrying Ji Yi off to. 

938
01:00:25,377 --> 01:00:28,676
 Do you think the culprit of this case will be caught? 

939
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:30,277
 He didn't do it. 

940
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:31,886
 Kang Baek isn't the culprit. 

941
01:00:31,886 --> 01:00:36,886
 The culprit I'm giving you is the guy who killed Hong Nan Hee. 

942
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,457
 What were you doing on the night Hong Nan Hee died? 

943
01:00:39,457 --> 01:00:42,196
 Hong Nan Hee died because of you. 

944
01:00:42,196 --> 01:00:43,926
 Yoon Gu Ryeong knew it too. 

945
01:00:43,926 --> 01:00:45,966
 Nan Hee... Professor Na killed her. 

946
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:49,231
 She waited for you to turn yourself in. 

947
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:51,640
 I'm really sorry. 

948
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:56,650
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

949
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,700
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫
