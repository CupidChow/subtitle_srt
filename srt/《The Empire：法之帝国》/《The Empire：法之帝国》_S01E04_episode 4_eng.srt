1
00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:04,128
   

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,430



3
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,035
What are you doing?

4
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,505
Gosh, you're outside.

5
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:24,945
We're looking for something.

6
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,106
Your tennis instructor is at the tennis court.

7
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:30,015
So tell me. What are you looking for?

8
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,915
One of my hairpins.

9
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,685
My dad got them when he went to France

10
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:36,615
for a conference. He said it wasn't easy to find them.

11
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:39,826
I definitely had it during my golf lesson.

12
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,856
I see.

13
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:46,226
It'll be great if they can find it, but if they don't, I'll buy you one.

14
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:50,336
You can't just buy it. It's a limited edition.

15
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:53,836
I see. That is a beautiful hairpin indeed.

16
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:57,304
Gosh, it was one of my favorite hairpins.

17
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:01,675
Please, look for it more thoroughly. I'm sure it's here somewhere.

18
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,915
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

19
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,595
Don't worry. I'm sure they'll find it.

20
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:44,256
- This hand? 
 - Yes. Grab it with your left hand.

21
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:46,625
- Grab the shaft with your right hand. 
 - I see.

22
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,655
All right. Remember the first step?

23
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,726
- The first step. Like this. 
 - Turn your body

24
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:53,926
and then grab the ball with your right hand.

25
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,678
And this hand.

26
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,136
- Swing! Gosh! 
 - Oh, my.

27
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,835
- Are you all right? 
 - Gosh. Sorry.

28
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:06,006
Here we go. In one, two, three!

29
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,206
Nice. Again.

30
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:09,076
In two, three! You pulled too much just now.

31
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,085
Keep looking at the ball. Get ready.

32
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,416
In one, two, three!

33
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,685
In two, three!

34
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,756
Okay, one more time.

35
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,692
One...

36
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,355
 A search warrant was executed on the biggest law firm in Korea, 

37
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,295
 Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, without any heads-up. 

38
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:58,895
 As no administration dared to investigate the law firm so far, 

39
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,536
 the law firm is believed to have more power than the Blue House 

40
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,405
 and exercising absolute authority. 

41
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:08,175
 Not only does the law firm have lawyers who used to be prosecutors, 

42
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:10,006
 but it also has lawyers who used to be 

43
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:15,316
-  high-ranking officials.  
 - Honey, what on earth is going on right now?

44
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:18,955
You have nothing to worry about. Just stay at home.

45
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:20,793
Yes.

46
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,484
The search warrant was issued to the law firm to pressure us.

47
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,956
Do you think it's prudent of us to go after Christmas Fund too?

48
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:02,656
The key point of the Jusung Investigation is to prove the illegal activities conducted

49
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:05,495
during the merger and acquisition at Jusung.

50
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:11,125
First off, Jusung's subsidiary, Jusung Chemical, changed

51
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,206
the protocol for accounting management around the end of 2017,

52
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,175
so they inflated the company's value.

53
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,305
That's fraudulent accounting, so it's a violation of the Capital Markets Act.

54
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,746
To handle the issues incurred during this process without a hitch,

55
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:27,344
they lobby the Blue House, and that was Christmas Fund.

56
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:30,015
You want to let that slide?

57
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,625
Well, I know that, but...

58
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,356
I'll counteract right away.

59
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:37,256
I'll get a warrant no matter what.

60
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,125
What's taking him so long?

61
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,575
I'll call him again.

62
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,628
- Ma'am! 
 - Come on in.

63
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,936
This is the student I told you about, Hong Nan Hee.

64
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,155
 Do you like it? 

65
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:13,595
 Yes, a lot. I like it a lot. 

66
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,635
 This is beautiful, 

67
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:20,735
 but it has diamonds and rubies. Didn't it cost a lot? 

68
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,706
 Gosh. Young lady, the price wasn't the issue. 

69
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:27,915
 I had to wait in line even before the shop opened up. 

70
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,746
 Just for you. 

71
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,876
 Really? 

72
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,999
 Thank you so much. 

73
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:37,465
 Give me that. 

74
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,061
 There. 

75
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,366
 - How does it look? 
 - It looks beautiful. 

76
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,650
 Really? 

77
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,475
Hello.

78
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:04,275
I just saw the news. Are you all right?

79
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,915
No, I'm not all right but this takes priority.

80
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,585
Prosecutor Oh.

81
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,285
Sorry to ask you to do this.

82
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,956
The computer crashed in a matter of seconds,

83
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,855
and the internal technicians are either on vacation

84
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,595
or dispatched to another department today of all days.

85
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:18,826
It's all right.

86
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,395
It only takes a second for a virus to infect computers.

87
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:23,735
Actually, this puts us in a tight spot.

88
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:28,735
We don't have much time left, but we're not sure if we can ask a student to help us with this.

89
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,376
Please, think of me as Kang Baek's friend,

90
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:33,905
not a student. You don't have to be so formal with me.

91
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:35,545
Okay. Thank you,

92
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:38,316
and of course, we'll pay you for your time.

93
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:41,256
Instead of that, could you buy us a drink?

94
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:45,135
Just the students from Minguk University for fieldwork.

95
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:48,056
I'll make time to do that.

96
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,126
Then I'll get to work.

97
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,910
This way.

98
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,775
Hey, honey.

99
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:05,375
Yes. I was about to call you.

100
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,676
It's a bit flustering.

101
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,276
Yes.

102
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,016
I'm all right.

103
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,985
Thank you.

104
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,731
Yes. Let's talk at home. Bye.

105
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:57,356
 Assistant Woo, where are you right now? 

106
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:05,765
I was writing a document.

107
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,947
Okay, I got it.

108
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:21,585
   

109
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:31,396
Whenever they released new products, I worked as a part-time reviewer.

110
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,896
So I had up to four phones at one time.

111
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,296
I love gadgets.

112
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:39,165
It doesn't feel like work. It's quite fun.

113
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,336
You're indeed a computer engineering major.

114
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,806
Then I'll focus now.

115
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,026
I'll try to restore the document too.

116
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,686
Yes, Mom.

117
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:53,446
Yes.

118
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,115
It's obvious.

119
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,556
When he didn't stop it,

120
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:00,356
he willingly paved a path for them.

121
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,656
Then you knew who the target was from the beginning,

122
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,827
but we don't know what might pop up now.

123
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,796
Okay, Mom.

124
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,965
Yes, I need to wrap something up.

125
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,405
See you at home later.

126
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,043
Okay, Mom.

127
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,906
Thank you.

128
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:22,418
Hye Ryul,

129
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,745
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,785
What are you talking about?

131
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,385
You're all I have, Mom.

132
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:33,686
I need you to be strong.

133
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,296
Don't let it show.

134
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:39,095
You understand me, right?

135
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,743
Whatever happens, I'll take care of it.

136
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:46,405
You're the best, Mom.

137
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,876
I'll get back to work now.

138
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,511
Okay.

139
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:11,880
   

140
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,965
Right. Did you all have dinner?

141
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:29,676
I should have asked you that first.

142
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,415
We're used to skipping meals from time to time,

143
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:33,915
but I should make sure you eat.

144
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,315
Please don't mind me.

145
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,704
I'm almost done.

146
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,073
I should buy you guys a nice drink.

147
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:45,128
Prosecutor Oh, can we talk?

148
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:56,935
So there are detectives digging the Christmas Fund case.

149
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,305
- Yes. 
 - To pressure Dolphin,

150
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,246
we need to secure the board members

151
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,515
of Christmas Fund, who had gone off the grid first.

152
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:05,986
So hand over what we have to the police

153
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,155
and support them with everything they need to make an arrest.

154
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,186
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:12,449
And I hope we can use your connection this time.

156
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,655
Reveal the number of times Dolphin visited the prosecution service.

157
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,963
Do you understand that?

158
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,485
Leak it.

159
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:23,719
I don't want any more excuses from him now.

160
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,079
This is crazy!

161
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,076
- What is it this time? 
 - Senior.

162
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,006
Let me say this first.

163
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:36,246
I'm the one who told the prosecution that you've been chasing the Christmas Fund case.

164
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,875
When did you leak that?

165
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,015
Are you coming clean now?

166
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,086
Senior, what do you need to do if you want to sell a lot?

167
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,485
Promotion, ads, and sales promotion.

168
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,585
It's all about promotion.

169
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,015
What on earth are you talking about?

170
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,726
Han Hye Ryul wants to give you the information she has,

171
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:55,406
so you can arrest the board members of Christmas Fund.

172
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:00,466
You have me to thank. I talked you up to Prosecutor Oh.

173
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,810
- Older Brother, I do agree... 
 - What?

174
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,430
...that she did you a favor this time.

175
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,375
- Right? 
 - Yes, that's true.

176
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,875
- Thank you. 
 - What? I can't hear you!

177
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,275
Thank you. Gosh, thank you so much.

178
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:14,285
I must have lived too long. Who knew you would be helping me?

179
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,216
Senior, since we're on the subject, can you talk—

180
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,956
Calm down, will you?

181
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,956
Try to strike up a deal after you calm down a bit.

182
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,620
Keep talking.

183
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,610
Do you want to read the message?

184
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:38,290
   

185
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,465
It's all done. I restored it.

186
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,301
Really?

187
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,395
   

188
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:57,995
Right. That's the document.

189
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:03,996
I transferred all the files to the USB flash drive, just in case,

190
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,376
to be prepared for anything.

191
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,037
Thank you.

192
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:12,216
   

193
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,209
Honey.

194
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,775
Are you here to comfort me again?

195
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,841
Gosh, yes.

196
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,731
Hello, Professor Na.

197
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,487
Hey, you're in her office.

198
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,873
What? You were looking for her?

199
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:52,836
No. I was wondering what she was doing here at this hour.

200
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,186
I had to take care of something urgently

201
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:56,986
and my computer was infected with a virus,

202
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,655
so she restored it for me.

203
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,921
She's quite gifted.

204
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,509
I see.

205
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:04,226
Ma'am,

206
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:08,826
if you're available, could you buy us a drink today?

207
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,499
Today?

208
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,261
Oh, is today a bad time?

209
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,755
No. Let's go today.

210
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,076
Actually, today may be the only day I can buy you a drink.

211
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:23,424
I don't feel like working anymore.

212
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:26,870
I feel awful, you know.

213
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,535
My husband loaded all the work on me.

214
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:52,546
What is this? Seriously.

215
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:55,546
Well, I'm baffled at this situation too,

216
00:14:55,546 --> 00:15:00,446
but I'm sure you're the only one the Jusung family can trust right now, Judge Han.

217
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,985
You can't proceed with this unless you fully trust someone.

218
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,901
Don't even call me a judge.

219
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,193
An inquiry agency?

220
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:10,785
It's totally illegal!

221
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,356
Mr. Nam,

222
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:28,876
if we can't pull this off after going this far, we're nothing but a bunch of idiots. Okay?

223
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,689
Okay.

224
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:35,645
I can't let these jokers bring down Jusung or Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

225
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:43,299
These lowlives will never do that.

226
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:57,335
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

227
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,945
- Let's go! 
 - Gosh.

228
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,505
- Stop! 
 - Let's drink!

229
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,949
- Yes! 
 - Let's go!

230
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:36,010
   

231
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:10,475
Come on, Butler Yang. You startled me.

232
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,403
Did you go clubbing again?

233
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:16,110
My friends have been begging me to go out with them.

234
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,727
Butler Yang, you'll keep my secret, right?

235
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:24,807
Please? Don't tell anyone.

236
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,496
This is the last time.

237
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:31,165
I swear. This was the last time.

238
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,985
I'm going to focus on my studies now.

239
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,539
Goodnight, Butler Yang.

240
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,996
Nan Hee, is there a specific type of liquor you like?

241
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,243
No. I like anything with alcohol in it.

242
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,375
Is that so?

243
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,591
Then I'll take you to a place I like.

244
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,145
Honey, what do you think about The Library at Seorabeol Hotel?

245
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:16,225
It's nice and private there.

246
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,946
- There? 
 - Yes.

247
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:22,306
Can you call and ask if we can reserve the quiet corner there?

248
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:24,035
Sure.

249
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:30,709
Hello. Yes, it's me.

250
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,366
Ms. Han and I are thinking about getting a drink at The Library in 20 minutes.

251
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:36,969
We're bringing a guest too.

252
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:40,605
It's just the three of us, but please give us the quietest corner.

253
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,343
Yes. Thank you.

254
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:50,617
We haven't been there in a while.

255
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:53,788
- That's right. 
 - I love that bar.

256
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,926
Can I lower my guard tonight? It's been a while.

257
00:18:56,926 --> 00:19:00,586
Should we get a room there since we'll be at the hotel?

258
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,768
What's wrong?

259
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:12,536
I forgot that we had a student with us. Oh my.

260
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,255
Nan Hee,

261
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:16,936
I'm off work, we're married,

262
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:21,127
and I'm his wife. So please be understanding.

263
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,416
Honey, let's get a room too.

264
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,811
This way.

265
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,346
We'll have a bottle of Chateau de Labro 1990,

266
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:32,915
1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 each.

267
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:33,686
Pardon me?

268
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,416
I'm craving Labro.

269
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,385
I'd like to enjoy its vintage in different years.

270
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:39,909
Bring us all you have.

271
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,426
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:45,155
I always enjoy wine with cheese, fruit, and simple appetizers.

273
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:48,227
- Is that okay with you? 
 - Yes, I like that.

274
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:52,606
If you don't mind, may I have a glass of champagne first?

275
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:54,742
That'd be great.

276
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:57,476
Why don't I choose a kind then?

277
00:20:57,476 --> 00:21:00,740
Sure, if there's a kind you like.

278
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:04,616
This is a great choice.

279
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:06,885
- Should I open it for you? 
 - Yes.

280
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,655
Oh, and please excuse us

281
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:11,056
that we don't have a full collection of Labro vintage.

282
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:13,755
We have no bottle of it from the years 1990 and 1994,

283
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:18,756
and we have only a bottle of 1992 and 1996 each.

284
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:21,576
You mean they're expensive because they're the last ones?

285
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,996
Give us what you have.

286
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:27,320
Sure, ma'am.

287
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,781
Thanks for today, Nan Hee.

288
00:21:55,935 --> 00:22:00,157
Thanks to you, I got to throw a blow right away.

289
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:01,881
Thanks, honey.

290
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:05,675
Actually, I was very astonished.

291
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:08,135
I'm still taken aback.

292
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:10,645
I was always after others.

293
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:14,325
I didn't think anyone would ever try to mess with me.

294
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:18,026
This sure feels awful.

295
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:23,121
I don't want to admit it, but today's a tough day for me.

296
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:27,680
Thank you so much for coming, honey.

297
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,106
I already knew it, but you are the only one

298
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:35,026
who's there to comfort and care for me.

299
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:38,776
Everything is going to be all right. Don't worry.

300
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:40,176
Okay.

301
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:44,524
I'm going to put it all aside today.

302
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,563
That's nice.

303
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:13,838
It's sweet, thrilling, and refreshing.

304
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:17,715
 It's sweet, thrilling, and refreshing. 

305
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,915
 What is it? I'm clueless. 

306
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,137
 Open the fridge. 

307
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:33,032
 It's so pretty. What is it? 

308
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:36,139
 A guide to paradise. 

309
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:44,143
It might guide us to paradise.

310
00:23:55,955 --> 00:24:01,359
I really don't want to go home tonight, honey.

311
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,839
Can you please go and get us a room?

312
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,045
Okay.

313
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,996
One with my favorite view.

314
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,596
Sure.

315
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:34,141
Don't give my husband the eye.

316
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:45,209
What did I just hear?

317
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:49,306
I thought you were gutsier than this to do something that crazy.

318
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:52,647
I said, don't give my husband the eye.

319
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:05,016
You knew everything, is that it?

320
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:07,900
Then did you think I wouldn't?

321
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,301
We're a married couple.

322
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,766
We don't simply get laid.

323
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:17,935
We make love, share each other's desires,

324
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:24,875
and peacefully and quietly, we sleep together until we wake up

325
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,195
without a sense of anxiety.

326
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,035
So it's easy to notice

327
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:34,947
traces on his body left by someone else,

328
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:39,109
even his sudden monotonous heartbeat.

329
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:47,491
If you know, how can you maintain such a relationship?

330
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:49,595
Because we're married.

331
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:53,513
Ms. Hong,

332
00:25:53,513 --> 00:26:00,790
honestly speaking, you are better than I thought you'd be.

333
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,750
It made me forgive my husband a little.

334
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,886
Must I be grateful for your compliment?

335
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:08,486
No.

336
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:11,581
You must be feeling rotten.

337
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:13,725
You don't have to show courtesy,

338
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:17,029
but this is as far as you can get.

339
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,065
How can you be so nonchalant?

340
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,265
Guess why.

341
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:29,963
What, do you think we're only married for show?

342
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,345
Right, let's say it's a strategically-needed relationship,

343
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:38,769
but you don't know how frightening and strong such a relationship is.

344
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,615
We share fate together.

345
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:46,185
It's different from temporary emotions,

346
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:49,529
so you better give up on your empty hope.

347
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:52,426
It's so hopeless that I even feel pity.

348
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,833
"A man's affair never lasts long,

349
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,655
and he will come back to his family one day."

350
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:01,506
What a grand way to say that obvious cliche.

351
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,976
Then tell me that your case isn't a cliche.

352
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:08,871
I know why you're provoking me unreasonably.

353
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,016
It's because you can tell

354
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:14,944
what we've achieved, what we share, and what we plan.

355
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,909
All of that is impossible with you.

356
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:24,114
I mean, if I let you have Na Geun Woo, would you be able to handle him?

357
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:30,457
I won't say anything to my husband.

358
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:33,691
You can't change anything anyway.

359
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,185
How can you be so sure

360
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:39,196
that I can't change anything?

361
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:52,245
Serve her in the best way you can.

362
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:55,011
Thank you for your help today.

363
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:59,331
I hope you enjoy your time here alone.

364
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,786
 Gosh, what time is it? 

365
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,320
 What is it? 

366
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,315
 Sleep some more. 

367
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:02,603
 I need to submit a column by the end of today, but I forgot! 

368
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,926
 You brought your laptop with you. 

369
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:08,453
 If it's that urgent, write it here. 

370
00:29:08,453 --> 00:29:13,066
 Well... No, I... The materials are at home. 

371
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,236
 Sleep some more. 

372
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,776
 Order some room service before you check out. 

373
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:19,391
 I'll leave my card open. 

374
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:40,431
Do they enjoy drinking Chateau Labro?

375
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:44,464
It's different every time, but they do enjoy it.

376
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:50,165
How much are all these?

377
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:55,968
It's slightly over 20,000 dollars.

378
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:59,522
Enjoy your time.

379
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,499
Darn.

380
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,035
I'm...

381
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:38,085
I'm so sorry.

382
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:40,045
Please spare me.

383
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,155
- I'm so sorry. 
 - Look.

384
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:43,356
   

385
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:47,026
You're a lawyer yourself, so you must know.

386
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,535
Did you really think you would be safe

387
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:51,736
after taking bribes from Dolphin this openly?

388
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:54,436
Right now, even if the legendary physician came back alive,

389
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,776
he would give up and return to the underground.

390
00:30:56,776 --> 00:31:00,145
You can't be spared. You're dead already!

391
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:01,406
Sir.

392
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,945
Please spare me. Please, sir!

393
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,427
Darn!

394
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:10,516
Even if you were my son, I couldn't spare you, son of a gun.

395
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:14,036
Everyone else is about to go down together with you!

396
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,886
Goodness.

397
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,545
Darn it.

398
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,139
I have to go.

399
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:24,323
Welcome those who barged in with reporters.

400
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:30,407
Don't think of anything else but this.

401
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,829
Go down alone.

402
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,857
I can't go down alone.

403
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:43,822
What?

404
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,353
What I took was only a small sum,

405
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:51,336
and Dolphin deals with billions of dollars.

406
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:56,080
What are you saying?

407
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,405
   

408
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:03,829
 At 7 p.m. on November 15th of last year, 

409
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:09,975
 while you were having boiled pork 

410
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:13,315
 with Dolphin, the actual owner of Christmas Fund, 

411
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:23,439
 a million dollars was loaded in cash 

412
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,831
 into the trunk of your car. 

413
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:33,535
How did you know that?

414
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,136
Isn't that obvious?

415
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:39,096
I cashed out the money. Didn't you know?

416
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,786
You know what?

417
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:45,832
I can't go down alone even if I want to.

418
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,615
I was only taking commissions from him,

419
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:50,356
and you were very close to him,

420
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:53,479
so you need to take care of me.

421
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:56,825
That's the way out for us both.

422
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:03,835
Gosh, Mr. Jung.

423
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,775
You should've just said yes when I begged!

424
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:08,566
Look how embarrassing this is.

425
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,006
All right, Mr. Jung.

426
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:13,002
Look, this is...

427
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,575
not easy.

428
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:22,116
If it gets out that I'm involved, the problem may grow even bigger.

429
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:28,054
Mr. Jung, can't you take the bullet for us all?

430
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:30,875
We'll try to come up with an issue to cover it.

431
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,825
It's going to be all right.

432
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,725
People will soon forget about it.

433
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:37,245
You know that.

434
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:40,183
You said I was already dead.

435
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,906
That even the legendary physician couldn't save me.

436
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,136
Gosh.

437
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:47,105
And if I take the bullet, they will soon find out

438
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:50,316
how I ended up taking the bullet and who's behind me.

439
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:52,727
Don't you get it?

440
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:55,105
Let's say you get to silence me.

441
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,405
What will you do about Dolphin?

442
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:01,225
I'll try to figure out a way.

443
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,525
All right?

444
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:07,995
Now that you said so, I'll be waiting at ease.

445
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,961
Pictures, texts, and ledgers.

446
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,105
   

447
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:18,509
And a voice recording.

448
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:22,653
Tell me if there's anything you want from me.

449
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,790
I said I was coming!

450
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:54,005
There they are!

451
00:35:00,986 --> 00:35:02,415
Do you have anything to say to the people?

452
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:04,615
- Any accomplices? 
 - What's the result?

453
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:08,515
- What's your view? 
 - Are you having any problems?

454
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:11,455
Who are the higher-ups you're suspecting to be guilty?

455
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:13,425
Did the suspect admit to anything?

456
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,325
- Please say a word. 
 - Sir!

457
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,566
Sir!

458
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:18,595
- Please say a word! 
 - Wait!

459
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:21,106
- Sir! 
 - Tell us what you know!

460
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:23,306
- Sir! 
 - Please tell us what you think!

461
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:25,530
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes.

462
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,045
We've been after them for three months and two weeks.

463
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:31,015
If we miss them this time, there won't be another chance.

464
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,446
We've got backup forces to block all the escape routes.

465
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,756
They're only Yeouido businessmen.

466
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:40,136
I doubt they have guns or are good runners.

467
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:43,045
Our struggles end today.

468
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:46,425
All right. Everyone, be careful.

469
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,905
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

470
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:50,865
Let's go.

471
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:53,327
It's okay.

472
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:56,466
Don't you want me to leave tomorrow?

473
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:59,225
- Hi, girl. 
 - Hi.

474
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,905
Hi.

475
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,553
What about...

476
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:05,409
- Hey, that looks delicious. 
 - Hey.

477
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:07,686
- Did you win some? 
 - Yes, of course.

478
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:10,866
- What's this? 
 - I don't know.

479
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,486
I'll buy you a handbag.

480
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:15,256
Hey, this guy is so good.

481
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,925
Take it easy.

482
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,360
What...

483
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,549
Come on and do it.

484
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,335
We're approaching.

485
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,701
Wait.

486
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,245
- Hey. 
 - What?

487
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:32,405
He's looking for you guys. What should I do?

488
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,181
Hello.

489
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,745
You ordered large-sized yangjangpi  (noodles, vegetables, and seafood)  and medium-sized tangsuyuk  (deep-fried meat)  earlier,

490
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:21,816
but the food was served the other way.

491
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,716
My boss says he's really sorry.

492
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:25,116
He wants to give you a refund for the yangjangpi

493
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:27,926
and offer some free food. Do you mind?

494
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:31,125
No wonder that yangjangpi seemed a little small.

495
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,725
Sure thing.

496
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:33,995
Okay.

497
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:36,325
We weren't expecting anyone. I wondered who it was.

498
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:38,785
- Sorry about this. Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

499
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:58,038
Darn it!

500
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:06,982
What?

501
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:08,296
Where did they go?

502
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:10,720
Where did they all go?

503
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,779
Darn!

504
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:23,276
Goodness!

505
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:25,216
We got the intel straight from the prosecution

506
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:27,486
but they ran off right before we raided them.

507
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:31,301
I'm sure the info leaked from within.

508
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,886
Sir, you know why the darn prosecution looks down on us.

509
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:38,225
We're pathetic, submissive, and servile just like them,

510
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:41,095
but we fall and submit to even the slightest pressure!

511
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,095
So, do you have someone in mind?

512
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:47,006
If so, I'd be beating them up to a pulp.

513
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,606
Then who can we trust?

514
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,190
For now,

515
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,260
other than Joong Jin...

516
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:55,576
What do you want me to do?

517
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:59,404
Summon them one by one and interrogate them?

518
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:01,946
You should tell us what to do.

519
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,756
I'm too ashamed to face Ms. Han Hye Ryul.

520
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,426
You know what to do.

521
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:08,325
You should tell her that the intel turned out to be wrong

522
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,555
and they were long gone when you went there.

523
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:12,426
We can't tell her that one of us leaked the info.

524
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,325
It hasn't even been a while since the reformation.

525
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,666
Sir, that's—

526
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,265
And for the time being, investigate the case only with him.

527
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:21,006
No one else is willing to join you anyway.

528
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:23,705
You two are known to ask for struggles.

529
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,936
What about us?

530
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:27,956
I hear you're too condescending.

531
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:30,018
Excuse me?

532
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:32,276
This is the Wide-Area Investigation Unit.

533
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:33,845
We take on big cases

534
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,015
and everyone's eager to make results,

535
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:39,825
but you guys are hung up with an unpromising case,

536
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:42,356
acting as if you're the only ones with a sense of duty.

537
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,416
Wouldn't that be ridiculous and annoying?

538
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:49,766
Don't give me excuses, and break the case. I want results!

539
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:51,395
- Ji Gu Won. 
 - Yes?

540
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:54,136
Let's just say you gave up on your own promotion,

541
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:56,236
but what about Joong Jin? He could reach senior superintendent.

542
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,799
Don't you think you're getting in his way?

543
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:11,886
Gosh. Maybe we shouldn't have brought it up.

544
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,156
We got nowhere with it.

545
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:18,295
No, it's fine. The boss said what was right.

546
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:21,866
You're not the type to end your career being a lieutenant.

547
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:24,935
You're the smartest person I saw.

548
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:27,935
Why put me on cloud nine all of a sudden? I can't get used to this.

549
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:31,475
That's why I'm going to catch

550
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,575
all of those involved in Christmas Fund.

551
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,646
I'm going to paint these jerks' faces

552
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:39,374
all over the news headlines and the front pages of newspapers,

553
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,143
and have you promoted.

554
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:53,365
Prosecutors seized and searched the Blue House this morning.

555
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:55,066
You have seen the prosecution vehicles enter the Blue House.

556
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:57,995
- Prosecutor Oh and employees... 
 - Prosecutor Oh Seong Hyun didn't...

557
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,365
- From Seoul Central District...
 - Answer reporters' questions...

558
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:02,066
And entered the main building of the Blue House with investigators...

559
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,436
The conflict within the prosecution is getting out of hand.

560
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:08,106
We have reported a few days ago that Jang Il,

561
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:10,675
 the head of Central District Office, has carried out a search 

562
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:13,646
 at Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, where Senior Prosecutor Han Hye Ryul's father  

563
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:15,586
 is the head. 

564
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:19,486
 There is a dominant opinion that this was a vindictive investigation, 

565
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:22,126
 as prosecutor Han has led an investigation on Jusung 

566
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:24,925
 and Christmas Fund without the approval 

567
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:28,225
 of the upper management and were at odds with Mr. Jang. 

568
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:30,736
 At 11 a.m. this morning, Prosecutor Han obtained 

569
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:33,936
 a sudden search warrant from court 

570
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:37,035
 on the alleged bribes case related to Christmas Fund 

571
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:41,174
 and has commenced a search on some of the Blue House personnel. 

572
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:43,445
 Meanwhile, the prosecution has explained that it's leading the search 

573
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:46,845
 with Blue House's cooperation, by securing necessary data 

574
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:49,186
 with the method of voluntary submission. 

575
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:52,216
Have you offered a bribe related to the Christmas Fund case?

576
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:53,785
You have visited the prosecution frequently.

577
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,785
What have you conversed about?

578
00:42:55,785 --> 00:42:57,409
I had meals there.

579
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,765
 As reported as an exclusive earlier, it was found out that 

580
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,825
 the corporate raider, Ji Joon Ki, known as Dolphin, 

581
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:06,236
 has visited the prosecution 70 times in the period of three months. 

582
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:08,236
 He is on trial on restraint 

583
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:12,106
 and is also the key figure of Christmas Fund. 

584
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,106
 We must keep an eye on 

585
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:17,316
 whether the investigation agency has aided and abetted the getaway 

586
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:19,646
 of Christmas Fund executives 

587
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,910
 - who are wanted.  
 - That crazy woman!

588
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,055
Han Hye Ryul,

589
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:32,555
that crazy woman! It's even difficult to pronounce her name.

590
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:34,559
Han Hye Ryul. Gosh!

591
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:42,256
Gosh, darn it!

592
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:44,383
That thing...

593
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:49,805
Are all her insides just guts?

594
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:51,945
Does she only consume guts and nothing else?

595
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:55,046
How can she be so bold like that?

596
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:57,885
Is she acting that way because she can't distinguish

597
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,285
between her backyard and the backyard of the Blue House?

598
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:02,405
How dare she storm inside there?

599
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,856
Ignoring all procedures and approvals.

600
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:07,466
Messing with us by leaking all information to the media.

601
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:09,265
Who does she think she is?

602
00:44:09,265 --> 00:44:11,436
Hey, take disciplinary action against her.

603
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:13,265
No, you can't. Never.

604
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:14,933
Why not?

605
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:17,075
You guys ignore all my instructions

606
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:18,535
and are playing the couple's politics.

607
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:20,075
Go ahead and take disciplinary action, then transfer her.

608
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,776
You can't, please!

609
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:24,416
She's asking to be hit.

610
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,785
Why are you trying to dance to her tunes?

611
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:29,586
She will only prosper if you do that.

612
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,186
You will only make a martyr out of her.

613
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:33,549
Hey! How dare you

614
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:35,356
bring up martyrs?

615
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:37,756
So stop obsessing over getting rid of her

616
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:39,026
just because you hate her,

617
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:41,265
and think that it'll be better to get her out of your sight.

618
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:46,666
- Why not just shoot her, then? 
 - What? And become a killer?

619
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:47,966
Yes.

620
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:50,336
- What you just said is correct. 
 - What?

621
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:53,936
Why make her the martyr and you become the killer?

622
00:44:53,945 --> 00:44:56,276
The more you strike her, the bigger she'll become,

623
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,876
and the more she'll grow as you trample on her.

624
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:01,400
She'll only thank you and dance around even more.

625
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,115
You and I have been labeled

626
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,716
as the "political prosecutor" who lined up for power.

627
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:10,147
We'll only give her a strong impression if we strike her.

628
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:14,165
Is Han Hye Ryul a person to be prosecuted by anyone?

629
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,836
Why sacrifice such a person and make her a political hero?

630
00:45:17,836 --> 00:45:21,176
Then, you want me to sit around and watch her do this?

631
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,635
Why aren't you reporting on the computer you confiscated?

632
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,475
There must be something on Na Geun Woo!

633
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,345
Since you are so heated up like this,

634
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,716
anything we have on them will be wasted and become meaningless.

635
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:32,615
And that's what that couple wants.

636
00:45:32,615 --> 00:45:35,385
They are thinking, "Let's get rid of everything that needs to be

637
00:45:35,385 --> 00:45:38,416
out in the open and blur it out where we can."

638
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,526
Their goal is not Jusung nor the VIP.

639
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:43,225
They are trying to paint a bigger picture.

640
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:46,256
Why are you trying to do the rough sketch for them?

641
00:45:46,256 --> 00:45:49,183
Don't set the table for them.

642
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:52,335
Let me ask you one thing.

643
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:53,749
You...

644
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:58,760
Don't you secretly want them to thrive, however twisted this is,

645
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:02,805
because of your son, Kang Baek?

646
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:05,219
What?

647
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:08,061
Listen.

648
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:09,885
It'll never happen,

649
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:11,816
but let me explain this with an example.

650
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:13,885
Let's say I got off with your wife.

651
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:15,526
I drove you out and took over your position

652
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:16,785
and made it into her family.

653
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:18,896
All this upsets you already,

654
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:22,365
but I thrive and become the prosecutor general.

655
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:25,595
And you idle around because you can't even quit.

656
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:27,181
And I ignore you.

657
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,851
But...

658
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,616
"I'm fine as long as my Ji Yi is well."

659
00:46:32,616 --> 00:46:34,566
Will you cheer me on?

660
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:40,811
You will take my wife?

661
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:46,186
Sure, why not? Thank you.

662
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:48,356
I'll cheer you on with all my heart.

663
00:46:48,356 --> 00:46:50,695
Money? Tell me if you need it.

664
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:52,437
No, I'm sorry.

665
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,366
I gave you the wrong example.

666
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:56,396
It hurts. I'm sorry.

667
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,696
What kind of example was that?

668
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,427
- Darn it. 
 - Gosh.

669
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:07,376
They have everything they want.

670
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:11,015
Now, there's only one thing left. Something that looks cool is left.

671
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:13,046
They want to play king.

672
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:17,274
Stop dancing to their tune when they are painting such a picture.

673
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:21,884
We've seen people grow out of political power like that.

674
00:47:21,885 --> 00:47:24,095
Darn it! Then, what do you want to do?

675
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:28,324
My nomination to be a candidate will blow over!

676
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:29,573
Gosh!

677
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:37,581
If I think about Kang Baek, I shouldn't suggest this.

678
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:39,821
Let's...

679
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,483
thread them.

680
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:48,261
What are you saying?

681
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:49,857
What about Kang Baek?

682
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:52,846
Thread them with what? Why bring up Kang Baek?

683
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:54,500
Ji Yi.

684
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:57,951
- What? 
 - Ji Yi.

685
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,841
She's head over heels for Kang Baek.

686
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:06,521
And you're saying you are thinking about Kang Baek?

687
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:09,655
Honestly, Kang Baek is out of her league.

688
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:13,475
If you turn them into your enemy, you're helping them thrive.

689
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,475
Let's just take them in,

690
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,575
then you'll definitely be insured.

691
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:23,716
The one thing that Han Hye Ryul thinks so dearly of

692
00:48:23,716 --> 00:48:25,564
is Kang Baek.

693
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:32,695
Would she fall for this that easily?

694
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:35,265
What do you think they found on the computer?

695
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:37,445
They are curious themselves,

696
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:40,405
but what if we don't disclose it and keep it to ourselves?

697
00:48:40,405 --> 00:48:43,085
That'll drive them crazy.

698
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:45,416
We should get in their hair.

699
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,226
The more I think about that crazy woman...

700
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:53,823
But would this

701
00:48:53,823 --> 00:48:59,129
work on that crazy woman?

702
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,725
Gosh, is that "crazy woman" referring to me?

703
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:05,425
You surprised me!

704
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:09,126
I knocked, but your conversation must have been so interesting.

705
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:12,535
I should move the sofa towards the door or something.

706
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,506
I'll be leaving now.

707
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:16,506
If a prosecutor investigates and prosecutes with evidence

708
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:22,469
according to the law and rules is a crazy wench, I'll be the crazy wench!

709
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:24,945
So, don't even think about doing anything,

710
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:27,886
whatever you find in the computers from Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

711
00:49:27,886 --> 00:49:31,145
That won't work on the crazy wench.

712
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:39,529
There was a passage that hit me hard

713
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:42,889
while reading a weekly news magazine recently.

714
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:46,395
I will quote it as it is.

715
00:49:46,395 --> 00:49:47,836
   

716
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:52,080
"This is a story about common sense and senselessness."

717
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,046
"Every day, there are laborers

718
00:49:54,046 --> 00:49:57,115
who can't return home in one piece from industrial sites in Korea."

719
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:58,276
   

720
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:02,216
"Around 2,000 people can't keep their promises to return home."

721
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:06,356
"The death rate of industrial accidents in Korea

722
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:08,626
is the highest among OECD member states."

723
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:09,686
   

724
00:50:09,686 --> 00:50:10,756
   

725
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:13,000
I'd like to ask this.

726
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,065
Is any part of the quote I just read sensible?

727
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:21,236
Korea's current labor market is beyond irrationality.

728
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:22,765
In fact, it is absurd.

729
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:26,804
 You are not in the place to talk about ethics to others. 

730
00:50:26,805 --> 00:50:28,715
 That's ridiculous! 

731
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:30,345
   

732
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:33,045
   

733
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:43,106
   

734
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,251
I...

735
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:57,936
am thinking about whether I have the right to criticize

736
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:03,827
a person's common sense and senselessness.

737
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:07,745
If only those without flaws

738
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:12,603
can criticize and reprimand others and social issues,

739
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,217
then I don't have that right.

740
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:19,441
However,

741
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,166
at least to the place where someone is waiting,

742
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,425
   

743
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:27,757
the right to go home safely should be protected.

744
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:32,957
That no one shall be exposed to danger without discrimination.

745
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:37,884
As a lawyer, I believe I'm obligated to say that.

746
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,529
Because the law is...

747
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:44,601
to protect the weak.

748
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:48,785
   

749
00:51:48,785 --> 00:51:51,485
   

750
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:07,845
 There he is! 

751
00:52:07,845 --> 00:52:09,745
Professor Na, thank you for your comments on the hearing.

752
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:10,746
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

753
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:13,015
Due to Prosecutor Han's sudden request for a warrant,

754
00:52:13,015 --> 00:52:14,586
the search and seizure are conducted in the Blue House.

755
00:52:14,586 --> 00:52:16,445
Were you aware of this?

756
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:19,416
Did you give her any advice on the Blue House search and seizure?

757
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:22,555
Do you have any comments on the perspective

758
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:24,856
that the connection between the Blue House and Jusung is

759
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:26,856
targeted to solidify your run for office?

760
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:29,466
When do you plan to make it official?

761
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:31,095
- I'm sorry. Let him pass! 
 - I'm sorry.

762
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:32,436
- Professor Na. 
 - Please!

763
00:52:32,436 --> 00:52:34,635
- Professor Na! 
 - Just one question!

764
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:36,206
- Wait! 
 - Is it true?

765
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:38,486
- Why won't you answer? 
 - Answer me!

766
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:50,663
   

767
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:54,179
   

768
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:57,515
 Honey, 

769
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,515
I watched the hearing.

770
00:53:59,515 --> 00:54:01,155
You looked splendid.

771
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,256
"Korea's current labor market is beyond irrationality."

772
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:07,104
"In fact, it is absurd."

773
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:09,799
 I knew you'd say that. 

774
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:11,274
You see,

775
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:13,556
can we

776
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:17,386
meet right now?

777
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:01,656
What's gotten into you? You never wanted to see me at this hour.

778
00:55:04,155 --> 00:55:06,387
Did you miss me that much?

779
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:17,531
Where are we going?

780
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:17,880
Where are we?

781
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:21,261
I wanted to...

782
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:24,585
talk to you in a quiet place.

783
00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:28,476
The place we always go to is quiet too.

784
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:37,296
This is so quiet, no one would know even if someone died here.

785
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:39,975
What are you saying?

786
00:56:39,975 --> 00:56:43,805
Look. There's not even a streak of light.

787
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:47,587
What?

788
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:50,747
Did you want to get laid under the stars?

789
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:52,668
You see,

790
00:56:55,566 --> 00:56:57,677
I have something to say.

791
00:56:58,196 --> 00:56:59,779
Say it.

792
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:02,314
It's not...

793
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:08,644
appropriate for this.

794
00:57:09,276 --> 00:57:11,955
Then?

795
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:18,962
How are you supposed to say it?

796
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:28,289
Let's break up.

797
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:43,017
I'm sorry.

798
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,607
What?

799
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:48,445
What did you just say?

800
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:50,015
Say that again!

801
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:52,863
What did you just say?

802
00:58:04,336 --> 00:58:06,356
 If I were this reporter, 

803
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:09,506
 I'd want them to sue me for defamation. 

804
00:58:09,506 --> 00:58:12,075
  - For factual defamation? 
 - Yes. 

805
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:15,075
 That proves the article is true. 

806
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,106
 Yes. 

807
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:18,816
 If they sue you for defamation of character, 

808
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:21,086
 you can file a countercharge for a false accusation. 

809
00:58:21,086 --> 00:58:26,810
 If I get sued for factual defamation, I'd request a judicial review. 

810
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:29,760
 That would take years. 

811
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,356
 I must do it no matter how long it takes. 

812
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:34,466
 Getting my reputation damaged, due to genuine fact, 

813
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,938
 is merely a false reputation. 

814
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:41,715
 I put together the related precedents and theories. 

815
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:50,106
 You have many of these. 

816
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:52,158
 Can I use one? 

817
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:55,107
 That could put you at serious risk. 

818
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:57,916
 That's how the biggest cyber attack 

819
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,676
 in 2008, on the US Department of Defense Network,  

820
00:59:00,676 --> 00:59:02,915
 began. 

821
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,225
 It started with the flash drive 

822
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:07,731
 someone picked up in the department parking lot. 

823
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:12,166
 The easiest way to hack is 

824
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,066
 to drop a few flash drives near the target 

825
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:18,026
 or hand it over to the target without a blink. 

826
00:59:24,175 --> 00:59:27,935
 And the target uses it. 

827
00:59:29,086 --> 00:59:34,690
 Then it will absorb all the data in the computer network. 

828
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:42,973
 A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. 

829
00:59:42,973 --> 00:59:46,117
 You must aim 

830
00:59:46,117 --> 00:59:48,430
 for the weakest link. 

831
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:55,345



832
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,870
   

833
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,400
♫  Finally in your thirsty heart  ♫

834
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:08,910
♫  Look, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

835
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:13,810
♫  Who will be left in the end?  ♫

836
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,680
♫  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  ♫

837
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:24,050
♫  It's a game of the tongue  ♫

838
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,920
♫   My heart is already on the floor  ♫

839
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,260
♫  Who will laugh at the end?  ♫

840
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,486
♫  On the shoulders of the giants  ♫

841
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:44,055
 Dolphin is no human. 

842
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:46,555
 You must be very careful. 

843
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:48,095
 Stop it! 

844
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:49,566
 I cannot do that. 

845
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,365
 What do I mean to you? 

846
01:00:51,365 --> 01:00:53,466
 I will embrace Ji Yi. 

847
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:55,265
 That will only complicate the situation. 

848
01:00:55,265 --> 01:01:00,506
 When I chose you, I bet all my pride. 

849
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,475
 Is what we see from that couple really everything? 

850
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:03,646
 Know your place. 

851
01:01:03,646 --> 01:01:05,646
 I will take full responsibility. 

852
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:08,916
 How are you going to take responsibility? 

853
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,716
 This will just kill that student. 

854
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:14,015
 If I was afraid of getting hurt, 

855
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:16,186
 I would've never started in the first place. 

856
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,033
 I should bet my life.
