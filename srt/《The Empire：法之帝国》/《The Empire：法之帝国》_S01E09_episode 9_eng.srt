1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,940



2
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,950
   

3
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:30,493
   

4
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,238
It's like meeting my first love. Nice to see you again.

5
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,908
I'm always amazed at how beautiful you are whenever I see you.

6
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,208
That must be why that jerk, Na Geun...

7
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:51,348
I can see why Kang Baek is so smitten with you.

8
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:54,984
Let's cut to the chase. Tell me what you want.

9
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:22,177
I'm sure you know that you must keep this confidential.

10
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:27,197
I'll be honest. It's not too bad.

11
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:32,687
Objectively speaking, stealing someone's technology isn't even big news.

12
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,928
Even if the report was fabricated,

13
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,087
the medium-sized company went bankrupt,

14
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,527
and the owner of the company committed suicide,

15
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:42,327
this kind of thing happens all the time.

16
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:47,568
Should I say it's so obvious what the conglomerates and law firms are up to?

17
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,814
However, the news I plan to expose is of a different nature.

18
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:25,738
I'm sure you know where these photos were taken.

19
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:30,018
As the tables have turned, the conditions must change. Correct?

20
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,970
Who are you? How did you...

21
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,488
What? How does she have these photos?

22
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,324
Apologize to my father

23
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,587
and the factory staff,

24
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:45,235
and apologize to me.

25
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,068
We're sorry about that. That's why we're trying toâ€”

26
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,271
That's not an apology!

27
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:01,048
You're trying to silence me.

28
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,540
Make a public apology, pointing out your wrongdoings.

29
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,590
Apologize to us.

30
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:12,347
If not, this will be the headline for tomorrow's news cycle.

31
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,330
   

32
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,548
 Yes, Gwang Jeon. 

33
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:53,620
 The land and the bonds I told you about are under borrowed names. 

34
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,127
 Right. Keep the documents, deeds, 

35
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,343
 and the affidavits to surrender in a safe place. 

36
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,892
 Yes. That's it. 

37
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,510
 Honey! 

38
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:52,128
   

39
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,541
Hallelujah.

40
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:00,877
Calm down.

41
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:40,021
 "My goodness, honey. Are you all right?" 

42
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:47,097
 By the way, what do you think her job was? 

43
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,837
 Maybe she was a masseuse. 

44
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:49,668
 No way. 

45
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,307
 Why not? She can melt his heart with her massage. 

46
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,877
 "Honey, this feels good, right?" 

47
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,948
 Left and right. "Do you want me to massage your legs?" 

48
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:59,648
 "There." 

49
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,228
 "What about your toes?" 

50
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,996
 Gosh. That's so awful! 

51
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,217
   

52
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,038
   

53
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,158
 You have a new inmate coming in! 

54
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,478
   

55
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,558
So you're the girl who killed her father for the insurance claim.

56
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:07,828
Why aren't you answering me?

57
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,268
What? Are you looking down on me?

58
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:16,633
I didn't do it.

59
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,771
What?

60
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,958
I didn't kill my dad.

61
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,729
I'm really...

62
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:31,001
I'm really innocent.

63
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:36,362
My gosh! Everyone here is innocent.

64
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:47,458
Gosh. Everyone here wants to cry.

65
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,094
Stop crying and get your things...

66
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:54,451
What? This is all you have?

67
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,103
Stop crying.

68
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,594
What?

69
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:27,327
Gosh!

70
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:30,731
No!

71
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,976
- Are you all right? 
 - My goodness!

72
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:49,487
She's all right. She must've hanged herself not long ago.

73
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,787
Goodness.

74
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:54,151
Do you think you got it worse than everyone else?

75
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,958
Why did you stop me?

76
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,561
Why did you do that?

77
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:03,095
Why won't you even let me die?

78
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:08,508
I don't want to live! Why are you getting in my way?

79
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:16,748
Hey, you guys. What's going on here?

80
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,017
It's nothing!

81
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,488
You know how tough the first night can get.

82
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,547
All right.

83
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,447
Help her calm down and go to sleep.

84
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,379
Sure.

85
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:37,661
"To some, life is a war.

86
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:41,492
To some, life is peace."

87
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,098
Have you heard of that?

88
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,249
No.

89
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:52,257
Do you even realize what you were about to do?

90
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:58,057
If you were to dig your own grave and put yourself in there,

91
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:03,094
you would only be making Ham Min Heon's life better,

92
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:09,198
after that jerk drove your life to the ruins.

93
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,681
What...

94
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:13,438
Ham Min Heon?

95
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,094
How do you know that?

96
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:23,777
If you're going to throw away your life, give your life to me,

97
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:26,041
then I'll help you.

98
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,667
Why?

99
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:33,988
Why do you want to help me?

100
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,808
Because...

101
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:44,486
I need to get back at Ham Min Heon for many reasons.

102
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:49,607
"Always be joyful, never stop praying,

103
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:54,007
and be thankful in all circumstances."

104
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:58,277
"Always be joyful, never stop praying,

105
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:00,677
and be thankful in all circumstances."

106
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:03,617
I always find the meaning of this passage so valuable.

107
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:08,188
"Don't fight evil with evil. Always be kind." I like that passage too.

108
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:12,158
Machiavelli said that we mustn't be so generous to the people who helped us

109
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,527
and be as cruel as we can when taking revenge.

110
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,056
Right.

111
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,916
Still, there's something that always bothers me.

112
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:27,238
Our Lord allows only those who are wedded to sleep together,

113
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:28,948
but we're still not married.

114
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,547
We're married in His eyes,

115
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,978
and everyone knows that we are married too.

116
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:36,448
We never registered our marriage.

117
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:40,311
It's not like we had a wedding in front of everyone, either.

118
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:44,127
It always makes me feel like a sinner.

119
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:47,328
A lot is going on in our family for the time being.

120
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:50,728
- So when the time is right... 
 - When is that right time?

121
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,836
It's been over five years.

122
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,938
You don't want

123
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,638
to register our marriage. Isn't that it?

124
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,408
When it comes down to it,

125
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:04,477
you're just toying with me, aren't you?

126
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:07,078
What? Toy with you?

127
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,718
What do you mean?

128
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,988
I would never do such a thing to you.

129
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:14,118
Then why do you keep putting off the wedding?

130
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:17,157
You're not the only one getting old. I'm in my 50s too.

131
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:19,157
For how long do you expect me to live like this?

132
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:20,877
Okay.

133
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,523
Come here.

134
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,363
I got it.

135
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,771
   

136
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,038
   

137
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,127
   

138
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:23,798
   

139
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:32,037
 Come see me in your office. I'll give you an hour. 

140
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,037
 If you don't come here in time, you'll see me at your house. 

141
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:37,438
 I'll go over there right away. 

142
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,157
 You have one hour. 

143
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,661
Come in.

144
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,118
Hey.

145
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:56,627
I forgot some files in my office.

146
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,087
I was going to read them tonight,

147
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,947
so I'll go back and pick them up now.

148
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:06,237
I guess it must be urgent.

149
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:10,242
Yes, I need to submit them by tomorrow morning.

150
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,321
I see.

151
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,587
Then you should go get them.

152
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,916
I won't be long.

153
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,467
   

154
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:22,858
   

155
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:32,281
   

156
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,806
You're here.

157
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:11,391
Why?

158
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,217
Why are you doing this? Why?

159
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:17,487
What wrong have I done to you?

160
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,697
It's not like you're a saint, either!

161
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:20,698
Let go of me.

162
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,913
Answer me!

163
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,608
What have you done wrong?

164
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,703
   

165
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:43,848
We had sex here in your office a lot, didn't we?

166
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:47,758
At one point, I didn't feel so safe about the security of this office.

167
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:50,058
Just to be sure, I checked out the director's computer.

168
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:53,298
Yes, I hacked into your mother-in-law's computer,

169
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,798
then I found this. How interesting.

170
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,838
Your mother-in-law is something else.

171
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:07,108
How does she manage to have breakfast with her cheating son-in-law?

172
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:10,008
After all, she knows everything we do.

173
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:11,656
I get it.

174
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,661
She lived with her dirtbag husband, herself, for 40 years,

175
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:21,871
so I guess putting up with you was a piece of cake.

176
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:27,158
Out of greed to have more,

177
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:28,927
and to fill their basement with wine that costs

178
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:31,967
tens of thousands of dollars when they won't even drink it,

179
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,737
stealing from other people came easy to them,

180
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:39,057
and they ruined other people's lives.

181
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,467
I never wanted what wasn't mine.

182
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,528
What we wanted was fair!

183
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,332
Nan Hee.

184
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,047
What are you talking about?

185
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:55,999
You'll find out tomorrow what I mean by this.

186
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:00,828
First of all, the phone.

187
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:02,911
Give me the phone I gave you.

188
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,773
Wake up.

189
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:07,098
I won't be gone even if you get rid of that burner phone.

190
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,081
Just give it to me!

191
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,237
This little thing isn't the issue here!

192
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:15,778
- Give it to me. 
 - No.

193
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:18,008
- I said, "Give it to me!" 
 - I said, "No!"

194
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,747
Give it to me!

195
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,547
No! Get off me!

196
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,644
Let go!

197
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,528
   

198
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,740
 Let go! 

199
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,181
Come in.

200
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:38,922
Thank you.

201
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,518
Sleep a bit more.

202
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,328
We still have time before breakfast.

203
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,787
No, I need to get up now.

204
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:54,220
Here's the newspaper.

205
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,800
Thank you.

206
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:28,137
There.

207
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,210
What's going on?

208
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,740
Kang Ye!

209
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:35,647
I found her missing hairpin while cleaning up this morning.

210
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,177
She screamed out of excitement.

211
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:39,478
Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

212
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:42,118
I was so happy that I couldn't help it.

213
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:43,648
What's going on?

214
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:46,339
Grandma, I found my hairpin!

215
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,187
You found your hairpin?

216
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,387
And here I thought...

217
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,528
Kang Ye, you shouldn't scream in the house early in the morning.

218
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:59,667
I apologize, but it's pretty to wear a pair together.

219
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,668
I see you're having a grateful morning.

220
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:05,337
Why don't you say grace for our breakfast today?

221
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:09,142
Grandpa, please.

222
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:38,308
What?

223
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:40,823
They aren't having breakfast today.

224
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,650
Everyone else in the family?

225
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,580
Yes.

226
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,286
This has never happened before.

227
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:51,170
Is something up?

228
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,527
 Earlier this morning, an unidentified woman 

229
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:03,397
 was found dead in the lake of Minguk University in Seoul. 

230
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:09,507
 A female student found the body on her way to the library 

231
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,138
 and reported it to the police. 

232
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:14,438
 The body was floating on the surface when it was found. 

233
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:18,248
 The police are working to identify the dead woman 

234
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:23,140
 and checked the CCTV camera footage and the periphery of the lake. 

235
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,666
   

236
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,197
The body has been identified.

237
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,838
It's Hong Nan Hee, a sophomore in law school here.

238
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:43,707
She didn't come back last night, so her roommate called the police.

239
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:47,377
We compared the body's fingerprint with hers, and it was a match.

240
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:50,477
Let's take care of these people first.

241
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:53,677
They're like flies in mid-summer.

242
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,278
If they were like flies, it'd be a relief,

243
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:57,218
but they're worse than mosquitoes and even piranhas.

244
00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:58,248
The body's over there!

245
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:02,288
Cases and accidents aren't just shows.

246
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,828
Other people's misfortunes are a way to make money.

247
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:06,957
Streaming is their source of income.

248
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:09,298
That's why they're swarming in like hyenas.

249
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:10,898
What?

250
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,523
Why is she over there?

251
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:16,012
She's unbelievable!

252
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:17,667
Over here!

253
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,038
- Gosh, it's so noisy. 
 - Hello.

254
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,160
 Something like this is... 

255
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,977
What's wrong with you today?

256
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,848
See some reason on a day like this.

257
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:26,717
So many people are watching.

258
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:29,487
You can't just jump up and down to call me over like that!

259
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,747
Did you identify the girl?

260
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:32,888
What about the phone? Did you find it?

261
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,824
Why do you ask? This is so out of the blue.

262
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:37,958
I heard something here...

263
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,524
yesterday.

264
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,433
Near the lake.

265
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:46,198
Were you here last night?

266
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:50,157
An informant wanted to meet me here.

267
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,257
Right here.

268
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:58,391
 The informant chose this place. 

269
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:00,806
 They probably felt 

270
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:04,569
 familiar and safe here. 

271
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:09,390
 We only exchanged texts, but I guessed it was a student here. 

272
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:14,040
 It was so secluded that no one came around past 11 p.m. 

273
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,840
 There were no CCTV cameras either. Only a student here would know that. 

274
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:21,137
 If it'd been like any other day, I would've thought they had changed their mind. 

275
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:24,726
 I mean, it often happens to reporters. 

276
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,307
 The phone is turned off. You'll be directed to voicemail. 

277
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,792
 After the beep... 

278
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:35,296
 But strangely, I felt awful. 

279
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:38,467
   

280
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:41,887
 Press one to leave a voice message. 

281
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:46,747
 Press two to leave your number. 

282
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:54,268
 I can't wait any longer, so I will be going for today. 

283
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:56,948
 You even turned your phone off so suddenly. 

284
00:27:56,948 --> 00:28:01,808
 I'm flustered, but I do understand. 

285
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:04,266
 It takes courage to do this, 

286
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,232
 but... 

287
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,471
 everything's okay, right? 

288
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,388
 I'll be waiting for your call. 

289
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,256
I...

290
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:39,481
should've gone there.

291
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:42,738
I should've checked.

292
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,988
If then,

293
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:50,778
she could've survived.

294
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:56,511
I knew it was dangerous.

295
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:57,797
I knew it.

296
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:01,098
Look. Nothing's for sure yet.

297
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:03,750
Whether you heard a body thrown in the lake,

298
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,667
whether the dead person was the informant,

299
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,708
whether that person was alive or dead already,

300
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,684
nothing has been found.

301
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:10,747
Don't jump to conclusions.

302
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,548
You were clueless at that time.

303
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:17,888
If somebody had committed murder and abandoned the body for real,

304
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:21,918
you would've been in danger too. So don't think of it that way.

305
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:24,749
What time was it

306
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:28,347
when you heard the sound? Did you see anything else?

307
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:30,062
It was around 12:05 a.m.

308
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:33,198
I couldn't reach her, so I texted her then.

309
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,067
Darn! There were no streetlamps,

310
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:38,447
and because of the branches, I couldn't see the lake from here!

311
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:43,029
The number!

312
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:46,414
I have the number. The informant's number!

313
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:50,417
Please identify this number.

314
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,817
Then we will know.

315
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,158
- Check. 
 - Okay.

316
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,888
Eun Mi, calm down a little.

317
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:57,887
You need to rest.

318
00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:00,098
Right, Ms. Yoon. Your eyes are sunken.

319
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,114
Go wait at home, and I'll get to you.

320
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:10,521
It's them.

321
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,267
Those people.

322
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:17,682
   

323
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,348
Here.

324
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:30,218
By the way, this lake is easily visible now that the sun is up high.

325
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:34,928
It's glowing like a stage with the sun right above it.

326
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:36,428
Don't you think so?

327
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:41,068
So the murderer was probably too flustered to think that far.

328
00:30:41,068 --> 00:30:45,728
They just wanted to get rid of the body.

329
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,578
Look. There was a case I handled before joining our team.

330
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,538
It was just like this one.

331
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:56,147
The body was floating on a rice field.

332
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,447
It turned out to be a hit-and-run.

333
00:30:57,447 --> 00:31:00,758
The culprit thought it was a pit and abandoned the body there,

334
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,427
but it was actually a rice field.

335
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:07,727
The water overflowed, and the body floated eventually.

336
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:11,067
To think of that time, I'm not sure, though.

337
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:14,824
But this seems too much like a play.

338
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,408
I mean, it's common sense that a body floats on water.

339
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,908
I doubt the culprit forgot about it, no matter how flustered they were.

340
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:23,547
They probably didn't care whether this murder

341
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,278
was discovered or not.

342
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,666
If Hong Nan Hee is the informant that Eun Mi mentioned,

343
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:34,323
- it could mean a warning. 
 - A warning?

344
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:38,289
As in, "Keep your mouth shut."

345
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:41,800
Whose mouth was the culprit trying to shut?

346
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,984
   

347
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,898
   

348
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:50,113
   

349
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,938
   

350
00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:57,974
   

351
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,950
   

352
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:10,688
 Remember. 

353
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:15,128
 I can become Aegis and Hades. 

354
00:33:44,948 --> 00:33:49,288
Here. It doesn't have many pages.

355
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,695
I'm not sure.

356
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,854
Professor?

357
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,087
You're here.

358
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,828
Don't you know how to knock?

359
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,780
Well, I knocked.

360
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:29,868
You're more than 30 minutes late for the lecture.

361
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,853
Oh, the lecture.

362
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:38,622
- Professor? 
 - Enough!

363
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,018
   

364
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,838
   

365
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:40,868
A criminal trial is an institutional strategy

366
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:44,067
operated by the five principles,

367
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,237
which are discovery of truth, justice, rapidity,

368
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,697
human rights, and proper procedures.

369
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:52,848
One of the important principles

370
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,192
is the principle of legal procedures.

371
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:59,047
This principle implies that a nation's punishment right

372
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:03,415
must be realized according to fair legal procedures.

373
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:06,128
Article 12, Clause 1 of the Constitution says that,

374
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:08,627
"Every citizen has the right to liberty."

375
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:11,928
"Unless provided by the law, they must not be arrested, detained,

376
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:14,638
seized, searched, and interrogated.

377
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:19,468
Without any legal procedures, they must not be punished,

378
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,177
sentenced, or forced to labor."

379
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:23,960
The principle of legal procedures...

380
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,430
   

381
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,565
Your wife is here too.

382
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,731
 Come in. 

383
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:40,648
Did you want to see me, Father?

384
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:43,587
What are you doing here, honey?

385
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:46,098
Father called me in to say something.

386
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:49,668
Don't you have to be on campus? It must be a mess there.

387
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:53,308
No matter how busy I may be, my children's business comes first.

388
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:56,471
Yes, of course,

389
00:36:56,471 --> 00:37:03,518
but sometimes, it seems like Hye Ryul is your only child.

390
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:07,518
I cannot stand your sarcasm anymore.

391
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,388
Well, this is what I'm like.

392
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:11,728
You know from experience.

393
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,328
If you can't stand it, will you divorce me or something?

394
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:16,368
- I could do that. 
 - What?

395
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,039
Enough.

396
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,868
I called you guys over to say something,

397
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:24,407
so don't talk about anything unnecessary.

398
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:26,507
Why are you looking at me?

399
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:28,487
- She started... 
 - Do you

400
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,707
really want to get kicked out?

401
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,456
Father,

402
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:34,748
I'm turning 70 soon.

403
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,188
You can't even kick out a dog like this!

404
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,958
A disobedient dog doesn't get kicked out.

405
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,290
It gets killed instead.

406
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:47,357
Stop Hye Ryul from being punished.

407
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:52,567
If you can't stop it, I'm going to make her the CEO of Ham &amp; Lee.

408
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,038
Are you surprised?

409
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,637
Then were you going to let her stay in the prosecution

410
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:59,874
after suffering from the punishment?

411
00:37:59,874 --> 00:38:04,003
And you call yourself a father?

412
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:08,292
You will be kicked out if she's stained even a tiny bit.

413
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:14,325
   

414
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,670
Watch it!

415
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,487
It's not in my plans

416
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,387
to get run over by my sister's car in front of my office building.

417
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:50,657
And you'd easily die in my hands?

418
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:52,728
I thought we agreed to be strangers outside.

419
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,932
We better.

420
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,567
It'd be unpleasant to see a judge and a prosecutor

421
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,180
from the same family stay close together,

422
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,233
but I'm in no position to mind that.

423
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:07,812
Actually, we're both in no position to mind that.

424
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,907
Hye Ryul, we aren't really on horrible terms.

425
00:39:11,907 --> 00:39:14,167
We aren't on good terms either.

426
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,774
Let's stop here.

427
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:18,788
And why did our sisterhood fall apart?

428
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:22,012
I was close to your ex-husband too.

429
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,257
Then why didn't you marry him instead?

430
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:28,797
It's all because of your greed!

431
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:31,797
You want Ham &amp; Lee while keeping your reputation high.

432
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:34,498
At the same time, you even want to realize your romance!

433
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,137
Then is it not your greed

434
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:40,261
that you can't let your husband spend a short time in jail?

435
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,978
About the female student of Minguk University,

436
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,948
who was found dead this morning,

437
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:53,628
she was Kang Baek's girlfriend, right?

438
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:57,902
Does this draw your attention now?

439
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:00,527
It's going viral online.

440
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:04,907
But when I saw her in our family's house,

441
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:08,390
she seemed too familiar.

442
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,477
Where do you think I saw her?

443
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:13,837
Why do you ask me?

444
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:17,507
Hye Ryul, aren't you curious

445
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,427
about how much I know?

446
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:24,906
Just how far I can go.

447
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:28,018
I won't go home anymore.

448
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,187
Come to me if you change your mind.

449
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:33,176
I'm open to compromises.

450
00:40:58,418 --> 00:41:00,518
 It's fine. 

451
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:02,926
 Yes, it's really okay. 

452
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,328
 Don't worry about it. Just do your work. 

453
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:12,098
 Yes, she'll be all right. 

454
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:14,178
 This has happened a few times already. 

455
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,052
 Yes. 

456
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:20,683
 I'll call you when I arrive. Okay. 

457
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,198
   

458
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:03,308
 Yes, Na Geun Woo speaking. 

459
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,053
 Breathe. Take a deep breath, slowly. 

460
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:13,717
 Slowly. 

461
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:30,512
 Mom... 

462
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:33,835
 Mom... My mom... 

463
00:43:35,038 --> 00:43:37,021
 My mom... 

464
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:07,737
 My mom... 

465
00:44:07,737 --> 00:44:10,237
 I feel so bad for her. What do I do now? 

466
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,868
 She spent her entire life just suffering. 

467
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:18,757
 Her husband left her with nothing but debts. 

468
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,490
 She sold tteokbokki 

469
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,972
 and sundae to raise her son, 

470
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,458
 but that selfish son of hers 

471
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,547
 left her alone in a care home 

472
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:37,636
 and barely visited her a couple of times a year. 

473
00:44:40,938 --> 00:44:43,145
 You should go see her now 

474
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,467
 to say your last goodbye 

475
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:51,377
 and let her go. 

476
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:55,864
 I can't go there. 

477
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,547
 If I go there now, 

478
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:05,892
 it means it's real. 

479
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,617
 It means she really is dead. 

480
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,918
 If you don't go now, you'll regret it. 

481
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:19,568
 If you wait too long and end up holding her cold hand... 

482
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:24,768
 You shouldn't do that. 

483
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:34,757
 Get in. 

484
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:38,398
 Get in the car and call Ms. Han. 

485
00:45:38,398 --> 00:45:40,737
 If you can't talk to her on the phone now, text her. 

486
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,368
 I'll just drive you there 

487
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:46,288
 and take the bus back to Seoul right away. 

488
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:50,257
 Right now, 

489
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:55,112
 she's the one you need. 

490
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,207
 So get in the car. 

491
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,257
 Let's go. 

492
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:10,080
â™«   Someone reflected weakly in the window   â™«

493
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:18,390
â™«   Who could that person watching me be?   â™«

494
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:27,420
â™«   Even if I ask multiple times, they just mirror my lips  â™«

495
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:35,470
â™«   Just a sad, mysterious smile   â™«

498
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:49,432
   

499
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:59,990
â™«   Like walking on the threads of fate, like wavering at a ragged breath   â™«

500
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:10,230

505
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,217
I'm sorry.

506
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:42,188
I'm sorry, Nan Hee.

507
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,568
You see,

508
00:47:57,568 --> 00:48:02,378
back in the day, people said judges could do everything except for changing genders,

509
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:05,938
but these days, judges can even change someone's gender.

510
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:09,878
Judges can kill or spare lives

511
00:48:09,878 --> 00:48:11,088
and even change someone's gender.

512
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,088
What can't they do? Are they omnipotent?

513
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:15,318
They have more power than deities. They really do.

514
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:18,262
Such a mindset is the problem!

515
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:23,797
A judge should never allow a man to become a woman.

516
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:26,828
A judge should talk some sense into them and make them repent.

517
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:29,068
The young men these days must be out of their minds.

518
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:31,768
They should be locked up in one of the guardhouses in the military.

519
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:35,607
A judge ought to make them realize the gravity of their sin.

520
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:37,148
Why let them have their way?

521
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,547
"The sin that must lead to death.

522
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:43,478
If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,

523
00:48:43,478 --> 00:48:46,248
both of them have done what is detestable.

524
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:48,087
They are to be put to death.

525
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:50,958
Their blood will be on their own heads."

526
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:54,097
Leviticus 20:13.

527
00:48:57,828 --> 00:49:00,636
The law school student who died.

528
00:49:02,998 --> 00:49:06,280
Isn't she Kang Baek's girlfriend who came over a while back?

529
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:09,808
We're having breakfast. Must you bring it up now?

530
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:14,118
From the Internet to social media, her personal info is everywhere,

531
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,748
but we aren't even talking about it.

532
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:18,217
What does that incident have to do with the family?

533
00:49:18,217 --> 00:49:20,518
Well...

534
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:23,828
Hearing that someone I know has died

535
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:26,608
makes me feel weird.

536
00:49:26,608 --> 00:49:29,058
Isn't that why you all skipped breakfast yesterday?

537
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:32,078
- Kang Ye, that's enough. 
 - I just find it odd.

538
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:34,338
It's so odd.

539
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,073
Dad,

540
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,007
the hairpin  you bought for me when you had a conference in France

541
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:41,424
was a limited edition.

542
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,748
 What is this, Dad? 

543
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,507
 Don't tell me this is the limited edition set. 

544
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:50,018
 There are only 300 sets in the world. 

545
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:51,918
 You said you wanted it, my princess. 

546
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:55,058
 I didn't think you'd actually get me one! 

547
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,188
 It's so pretty! It's gorgeous! 

548
00:49:58,188 --> 00:49:59,387
 How did you get your hands on this? 

549
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:00,558
 What do you think? 

550
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:03,058
 I got there before the shop opened and waited in line to get one. 

551
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:04,927
 Didn't you have a busy itinerary? 

552
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,268
 But I had to make time for it. Look how excited she is. 

553
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:10,567
 Dad, you're the best! 

554
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:13,635
 Thanks so much! 

555
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:17,109
 How can you be so sure 

556
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:20,637
 that I can't change anything? 

557
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:25,867
There are some photos of her circulating on the Internet.

558
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:29,387
One of them was a photo of her wearing those hairpins.

559
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:32,696
There are only 300 sets in the world.

560
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:39,131
The day I finally found one of the hairpins, she died.

561
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:54,947
Hey, how can you eat right now?

562
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:59,088
The girl you wanted to marry is dead.

563
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,251
It's what everyone wanted.

564
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:09,267
I'm trying not to ruin everyone else's happiness.

565
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:18,737
Dad, I'm sorry,

566
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:21,137
but I'll just throw out those hairpins.

567
00:51:21,137 --> 00:51:23,046
It creeps me out.

568
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:33,102
They left a lot of food today.

569
00:51:33,102 --> 00:51:35,857
I know. They barely ate.

570
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:39,554
Right. They barely ate.

571
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,658
Has this happened before?

572
00:51:43,658 --> 00:51:45,702
No!

573
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:49,184
Something must've happened.

574
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:54,478
Yes. Something too serious to eat.

575
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,593
You two!

576
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:03,547
If you want to eat, you better watch your mouth.

577
00:52:03,547 --> 00:52:05,132
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:12,788
We're changing the menu for this week.

579
00:52:12,788 --> 00:52:14,257
For the time being,

580
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:17,898
we're only making dishes that are easy to digest and help one calm down. Understand?

581
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:20,054
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

582
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:29,336
   

583
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:35,018
- Here. 
 - No thanks.

584
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,947
I'll only feel uncomfortable underwater if I eat.

585
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:40,407
Did you check to whom the number Eun Mi gave us belongs?

586
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,727
Just as you expected, it's the same as the victim. Hong Nan Hee.

587
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:49,528
Do you really have to go in there yourself?

588
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:52,196
We have expert divers.

589
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:57,058
Gu Won! Geez.

590
00:52:57,058 --> 00:52:59,737
This is where it begins.

591
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:03,141
This is why I got the license.

592
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,073
- Stop complaining. 
 - Be careful.

593
00:53:06,073 --> 00:53:08,112
Don't worry.

594
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:11,818
It's not that deep, and I'm not going in alone.

595
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:13,387
Oh, right.

596
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:16,787
Watch the monitor carefully and see if I miss anything.

597
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,865
Yes?

598
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,558
Hello, Professor. You have mail.

599
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:43,098
The lecture is at 2 p.m.

600
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:45,298
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

601
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,170
   

602
00:56:34,118 --> 00:56:38,361
   

603
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,117
 Are you happy that I'm gone? 

604
00:58:09,117 --> 00:58:12,631
 Are you happy that I'm dead? 

605
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:38,940



606
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,940
â™«  Yes, we are all burning on the tide  â™«

607
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,050
â™«  It's a game of the tongue  â™«

608
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,760
   

609
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,200
â™«  My heart is already on the floor  â™«

610
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,910
â™«  Who will laugh at the end?  â™«

611
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,600
â™«  Faded scriptures, a race without satisfaction  â™«

612
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:24,080
â™«  Not even a balance of strength  â™«

613
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:34,130
â™«  Sweet corruption, expected fall, shining blade  â™«

614
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,828
 The man in Hong Nan Hee's photo on the Internet. 

615
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,197
 Isn't that Kang Baek? 

616
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:42,998
 Did you think I was unaware? 

617
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:45,337
 Did you really think I wouldn't know? 

618
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:47,938
 Kang Baek, you're acting really weird. 

619
01:00:47,938 --> 01:00:50,037
 Nan Hee was murdered! 

620
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:51,748
 She was killed trying to tip off. 

621
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,847
 You must find out who wanted to silence her and why! 

622
01:00:54,847 --> 01:00:58,032
 You're a prosecutor. You know it. 

623
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:00,518
 How women normally get killed. 

624
01:01:00,518 --> 01:01:03,058
 The murderer is nearby. 

625
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:08,128
 You don't seem desperate to solve this case at all. 
You look like you don't want to catch the culprit. 

626
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:10,197
 I think the time that you mentioned has come. 

627
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:12,697
 I'm not sure if I can be of any help but you can ask me. 

628
01:01:12,697 --> 01:01:16,397
 There's someone I'm suspecting. 

629
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:19,737
 You know, you let me borrow this thing the other day. 

630
01:01:19,737 --> 01:01:23,260
 There's a hacking program installed on this thing. 

631
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,370
â™«  Who will laugh at the end?  â™«
