1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:12,060



2
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,544
   

3
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,274
   

4
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,314
   

5
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,643
   

6
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:36,423
   

7
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:42,983
   

8
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,624
   

9
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:50,390
   

10
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,604
   

11
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:59,503
   

12
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:03,263
   

13
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:07,284
   

14
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:10,153
I had no idea there would be this many articles.

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,223
Anyway, I'm glad this is working in your favor,

16
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,763
although I'm a bit shy about this.

17
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:23,133
Do you want to have a glass of wine outside?

18
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,573
If you can spare some time for me?

19
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:28,154
Wine?

20
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,502
Darn it!

21
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:50,834
   

22
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:57,734
   

23
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,864
Hey, call for the Disciplinary Committee.

24
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:02,364
I'm going to suspend her and get her off this case.

25
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:05,310
This buried the Dolphin case.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,373
Are you sure you want to push forward?

27
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:10,178
You jerk! Don't you start with me again!

28
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:12,683
You better show me where your loyalty lies.

29
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:15,914
A prosecutor tried to fabricate the investigation by coercing the convict!

30
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:18,914
This absurd act shouldn't bury her wrongdoing!

31
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,554
Does she think she's an actress? Is she filming a movie?

32
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:26,598
She also failed to maintain her dignity as a prosecutor.

33
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:28,224
Yes.

34
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,434
Hey, Director Yoon,

35
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,634
I'll give you a big scoop today.

36
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:35,963
Han Hye Ryul is going to face disciplinary action.

37
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,234
Of course, it's really happening. I'll get you a big scoop.

38
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,982
Okay.

39
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:44,044
Don't thank me. We're family.

40
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:45,413
Okay.

41
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:48,458
   

42
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,353
   

43
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,553
- What's your name? 
 - Oh Kang.

44
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,653
Please give me your phone.

45
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:08,442
- What's your name? 
 - Jang Ji Yi.

46
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:11,540
   

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,073
Do you have any other communication devices?

48
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,044
No.

49
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,114
Tablet PCs, smartwatches, or laptops aren't allowed inside.

50
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,566
- Okay. 
 - You can go in.

51
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:47,103
Professor Hwang, it's me.

52
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,932
Okay.

53
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:54,056
Gosh! You did a great job with your research!

54
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,614
So listen. Just use what I wrote down for you,

55
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:57,984
then you won't have a problem advancing.

56
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,524
 After that, for the final round, 

57
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,984
 some questions might change at the last minute, 

58
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,894
 or they might put in additional questions. 

59
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,664
When that happens, text me right away. Be careful.

60
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,593
Thank you so much, Professor Hwang.

61
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,494
I'll call you once I see the questions.

62
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,042
Okay.

63
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,600
   

64
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,069
Professor Hwang?

65
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,417
Was that Hwang Yong Ji?

66
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,854
I'm sure you signed an oath that you won't receive any external assistance.

67
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:36,172
Besides, how could you have a cell phone here?

68
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:39,583
I thought you had to turn it in when entering the venue.

69
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,500
I see.

70
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:50,029
I must have caught you violating the rules,

71
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,703
then I must report you.

72
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,503
Wait!

73
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,562
Don't tell anyone.

74
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,152
Why not?

75
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:03,743
If I get caught, I won't get to compete.

76
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,384
So you know the consequence?

77
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,024
My entire team will get disqualified.

78
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,783
You know who's on my team, right?

79
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,894
Ah Jeong worked really hard for this.

80
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,228
Are you guilt-tripping me now?

81
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,307
You're so pathetic.

82
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:23,556
If you turn in your cell phone now, I'll pretend I never saw you here.

83
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,524
Okay.

84
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,614
People who want to practice law are here to use their arguments

85
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:39,254
to compete, even if this is just a mock trial.

86
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:42,754
It's so embarrassing that I go to the same law school as you.

87
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:46,124
Do you feel good as long as you don't get caught?

88
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,348
Are you lecturing me now?

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,323
Aren't you busy?

90
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,493
I bet Professor Hwang wrote your essay for the competition too.

91
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:56,681
Does Kang Baek know what you're up to?

92
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,394
Why are you bringing him up now?

93
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,302
What are you going to do?

94
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:04,528
Do you have proof?

95
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:09,214
This is why you'll never have him.

96
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,183
Do you think we're in a legal battle now?

97
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,604
Why do I need proof?

98
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:17,398
Whatever I say to him is the law.

99
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,424
You just wait and see.

100
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:36,376
He's going to marry me.

101
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,024
"We will soon prove your crime."

102
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:48,083
   

103
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,323
"We have a witness and evidence."

104
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,193
   

105
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:55,030
"So don't drag your mother into this.

106
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,634
Just confess your crime."

107
00:06:56,634 --> 00:07:01,292
This is why the defendant made a false confession.

108
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,233
In the US, when suspects confess to their crimes,

109
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,603
they're indicted with a lighter charge,

110
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:05,873
and their sentences are often reduced.

111
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:08,474
In our country, when the suspects show remorse and repent,

112
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:10,073
the court ruling can favor them.

113
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,114
This is why lawyers advise their clients

114
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,714
to confess to their crimes,

115
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:16,113
as a way to reduce their sentences during trials.

116
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:18,054
The investigator suggested that the defendant should confess

117
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,683
for the defendant's sake.

118
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:23,324
How can you argue that it caused her to make a false confession?

119
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,024
At the time of the interrogation, the investigator didn't have

120
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:28,763
any direct evidence or witnesses that connected her to the murder.

121
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,364
As there was no other evidence,

122
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:33,364
the investigator had no choice but to rely on the confession.

123
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,433
When the investigator leans too much on the confession,

124
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:39,273
it's bound to lead to a violation of human rights.

125
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:40,973
Confessions went from the most desired evidence

126
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:42,704
to less desired evidence for a reason.

127
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,613
Theoretically, the defendant is supposed

128
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,883
to confront the prosecutor as equals,

129
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,784
and was that the case in real life too?

130
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:52,413
In real life, the defendant was only a 20-year-old female

131
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,623
imprisoned for allegedly murdering her father.

132
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,293
Her mother was arrested as an accomplice as well,

133
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,794
so she couldn't even see her either.

134
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,063
They were completely isolated.

135
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,133
The investigator took advantage of the defendant

136
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:06,533
and deceived the defendant by lying that there was a witness and evidence.

137
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,263
The investigator made it impossible for the defendant not to confess.

138
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,633
Therefore, the confession cannot be admissible in court

139
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,444
based on Article 309 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

140
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,114
Right. We didn't have direct evidence.

141
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:19,214
However, we had a lot of circumstantial evidence.

142
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,283
Besides, a murder charge can be recognized based on circumstantial evidence.

143
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,884
We have a precedent from the Supreme Court

144
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:26,583
that a murder charge was recognized when the body hadn't been found.

145
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,354
The defendant and the defendant's mother were abused by the father,

146
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,323
according to their neighbors and relatives.

147
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:33,494
The liquor bottle had agricultural chemicals,

148
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:36,733
and the autopsy analysis showed he died from drinking the chemicals.

149
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:40,364
More importantly, not long after the victim passed away,

150
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:42,834
the defendant filed an insurance claim that amounted to 1.5 million dollars,

151
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,404
and we also confirmed that two years ago,

152
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,804
the victim had a spike in life insurance policies.

153
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,943
To collect the claim, the victim had to pass away.

154
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,474
The defendant was told that there was a witness

155
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:51,673
and evidence, because it was the truth.

156
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,713
How is that considered deception?

157
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,744
If the defendant was really innocent,

158
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,654
was falsely accused, and didn't commit the crime,

159
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,453
she should have claimed to be innocent to the end.

160
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,953
Your argument that innocent people won't falsely confess

161
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,593
is considered a slippery slope argument.

162
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:07,423
A sense of isolation and humiliation.

163
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,593
Giving up because the investigator won't believe them,

164
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,234
to escape from their painful situation.

165
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,663
An assumption that they can prove their innocence,

166
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:16,774
even if they confess to the crime now.

167
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,874
A misled thought that they won't be punished as they are innocent.

168
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:24,244
Fear that they will be punished more severely if they keep denying the accusation

169
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,580
and so on.

170
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,984
Based on these many reasons I just mentioned,

171
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,244
a lot of innocent people

172
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,683
were wrongfully forced to confess to crimes they didn't commit.

173
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,183
About 30% of miscarriages of justice cases

174
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:37,193
were caused by false confessions, according to research.

175
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,124
I would like to ask you this.

176
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,193
Which chance do you think will be higher?

177
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:44,494
Criminals denying their crimes and lying about their involvement?

178
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:49,703
Or innocent people confessing to crimes they didn't commit?

179
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,374
Moreover, the defendant confessed after being informed

180
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:52,604
about her right to refuse

181
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:54,544
to answer questions or receive help from a lawyer.

182
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,044
On top of that, when the trial began,

183
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,973
the defendant agreed on using her confession

184
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:01,225
and interrogation report as evidence.

185
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,783
You guys are arguing based on the small chance that

186
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:08,443
the defendant might have falsely confessed to the crime.

187
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:13,204
The record clearly shows the voluntariness of the confession.

188
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,506
   

189
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21,963
What if the victim's relative, who was an insurance planner,

190
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:23,973
constantly urged the victim to sign up for insurance policies?

191
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,744
What if she couldn't say no and ended up buying the policies?

192
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:30,843
What if the victim bought and paid for the policy on his own?

193
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,983
What if the defendant and the defendant's mother

194
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:37,353
also had multiple insurance policies?

195
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:42,353
What if the victim made enough money to pay for the insurance policies?

196
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,624
What do you think then?

197
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,324
Pardon?

198
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:52,346
That's not in the record.

199
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,126
Of course not.

200
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:56,064
Maybe, it wasn't supposed to be on the record!

201
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,503
   

202
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,188
   

203
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:11,584
Don't worry.

204
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:14,228
Well, Counsel.

205
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:18,254
This is based on a made-up case.

206
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,594
You can't ask us

207
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,763
why that isn't in the record like it actually happened.

208
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,224
Objection!

209
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,694
Counsel One is ignoring the basic rules of the mock trial,

210
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:28,463
which is based on a made-up case.

211
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:31,143
This is a violation of the rules.

212
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,603
She should face a points deduction.

213
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,408
   

214
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:41,183
The motive of this case was the insurance claim.

215
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,083
The bottom line was the money.

216
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,654
Why? And how did the victim end up with the insurance policies?

217
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,624
Who signed up in the first place and paid for her insurance?

218
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,823
This record lacks the most important causal relationship.

219
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:55,923
This record lacks any evidence that may favor the defendant.

220
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:00,404
Even though this is a made-up case,

221
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:05,433
it's impossible for me not to ask if this record was put together

222
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,893
fairly in the defendant's eyes.

223
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,054
   

224
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:22,154
All right. That must be the flaw of the question.

225
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:25,820
I hope you can be understanding.

226
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,264
However, during this mock trial competition,

227
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,063
you cannot arbitrarily hypothesize

228
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,834
based on a made-up causal relationship

229
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,303
or fault the investigator for not being more thorough.

230
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,076
Right.

231
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:37,816
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:41,774
Based on the indirect and circumstantial evidence provided to us,

233
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:47,274
we still argue that the murder charge cannot be acknowledged.

234
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,284
Okay. Counsel,

235
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:53,446
is there an additional argument?

236
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,946
No, Your Honor.

237
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:01,463
Okay. Then prosecution, you may recommend the sentencing.

238
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:04,733
To claim a large sum of money from the insurance company,

239
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,604
the defendant committed a crime against humanity

240
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:08,964
of murdering her own father.

241
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:11,104
Find out about that girl.

242
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,374
And he's only appealing emotionally.

243
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,104
She seems way too good, which creeps me out.

244
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,852
We ask for the

245
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:21,920
defendant to face 25 years in prison.

246
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,654
Yes, sir.

247
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:26,784
   

248
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:30,994
Convicting another human being is truly challenging.

249
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:34,094
I can't even sleep the night before the announcement

250
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,494
of my ruling for a criminal case.

251
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:40,533
After giving out a heavy sentence, I have nightmares for days.

252
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,598
Why? In case I was wrong.

253
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:44,973
You must think I'm lying.

254
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,903
Just like this case, we dealt with today,

255
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:49,344
we have several criminal cases that don't show us

256
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:50,943
clear answers every month.

257
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:54,414
On top of that, certain cases I come across on the bench

258
00:13:54,414 --> 00:14:00,254
make me wonder if I have made the right decision for decades.

259
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,553
However, after watching you argue in the courtroom today,

260
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,594
I noticed that you were asking better questions,

261
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,923
and I realized you might be able to make better decisions.

262
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,555
So I feel quite proud.

263
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,830
All right. The award will be presented...

264
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,430
   

265
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,344
...by the head lawyer of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

266
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:24,260
Han Gun Do will present the award.

267
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,583
   

268
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:36,083
The Grand Award of the 13th Mock Trial Contest

269
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,193
goes to Group 48!

270
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:45,961
Jang Ji Yi, Yoo Hyun, Lee Ah Jeong, and Im Joo Hyun.

271
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:50,104
The Top Excellence Award goes to Group 32.

272
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:54,642
Hong Nan Hee, Han Kang Baek, Jeong Kyung Yoon, Yoon Gu Ryeong.

273
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,774
Good job today, Ji Yi.

274
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,794
Thank you.

275
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:02,014
You should have gone easy on him.

276
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:05,560
I thought he liked smart women.

277
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,278
I see. I thought so too.

278
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,163
Congratulations.

279
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,912
Thank you.

280
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,621
Your argument was impressive today.

281
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:35,626
Thank you.

282
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:39,296
I tend to research very thoroughly.

283
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,341
   

284
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,854
I will now announce the Best Individual Award.

285
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,693
This award goes to only one student

286
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:54,093
who showed the most potential as a future law officer.

287
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,200
Congratulations, Ms. Jang Ji Yi of Minguk University.

288
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,204
Thank you.

289
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,650
   

290
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:20,634
You guys should go without me. I'll catch up with you.

291
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,744
Thank you for the opportunity today.

292
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:43,984
Oh, you're that student from Minguk University, right?

293
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,824
Your argument was impressive.

294
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:48,654
It's a pity you didn't win. I liked your argument.

295
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,674
Perhaps, I researched too much.

296
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:55,094
It felt like an actual case, not a made-up case,

297
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,434
so I found myself getting wrapped up in the case.

298
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:04,263
It was based on Kim's murder case, 30 years ago, right? The one where the daughter allegedly murdered her father?

299
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,033
Back then, the presiding judge was Ham Min Heon,

300
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,904
the founder of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation.

301
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:15,172
And back then, you were Kim's defense attorney.

302
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:20,813
But today, the head lawyer of Ham &amp; Lee law corporation came to present the awards.

303
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:23,344
The legal circle is small, isn't it?

304
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:29,260
To be honest, I was quite surprised by your argument earlier.

305
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:33,884
You made the same argument I presented 30 years ago.

306
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:41,860
In the end, Kim was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

307
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,214
Have you put this case behind you?

308
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,968
Or do you still have nightmares?

309
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:51,992
The nightmares

310
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:54,838
don't go away that easily.

311
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:59,554
Seeing how there are people like you

312
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:03,263
will bring a lot of comfort to people like Ms. Kim Yang Sun.

313
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:06,863
Then I'll get going now.

314
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,054
   

315
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,864
The defendant still pleads not guilty.

316
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,394
Yes, Your Honor. To prove her innocence,

317
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:40,033
I would like to file new evidence—

318
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,553
I would like to ask this to the defendant.

319
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:46,128
Do you still plead not guilty?

320
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,451
Yes.

321
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:54,783
I really didn't kill my father.

322
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:55,684
- What? 
 - She's still saying that?

323
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:59,798
Then why did you confess to the crime?

324
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,884
Because...

325
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:05,478
I was scared.

326
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,264
They didn't let me sleep for days, cursed at me, and beat me up.

327
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:10,314
I was not in my right mind.

328
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,678
My mom...

329
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:15,863
When I thought that my mom will be going through the same thing,

330
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,332
I couldn't stand that,

331
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:21,773
so I thought it was better that I took the blame.

332
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:26,161
But Defendant, you're not showing any sign of remorse.

333
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,621
What?

334
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:30,953
So in other words, you're blaming other people.

335
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:35,434
Your Honor, I'm not trying to blame other people.

336
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,710
You're right, Your Honor.

337
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,415
The defendant is blaming other people.

338
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,193
What did you just say?

339
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:49,404
The defendant and I

340
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,822
are here to blame other people.

341
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:57,373
The defendant shouldn't repent as she has done nothing wrong.

342
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,033
She must rightfully blame other people

343
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,894
because someone else is responsible for this murder.

344
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:06,113
- What? 
 - Someone else did it?

345
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:08,523
Are you talking about the defendant's mother?

346
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:10,423
No.

347
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:13,254
Three days after the victim's death, the victim's friend

348
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,263
from the same neighborhood, Jung,

349
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,394
committed suicide by drinking the same agricultural chemicals.

350
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:19,664
- What? 
 - Really?

351
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,734
- Did you know that? 
 - His friend, Jung?

352
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:25,604
So you're telling us that the real culprit passed away?

353
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:26,603
   

354
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:30,532
You're blaming the dead again this time.

355
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,814
Please take a close look

356
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:37,114
at Evidence 16, the picture of a soju bottle.

357
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,484
   

358
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,980
   

359
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:47,618
It wasn't for retail but for business use.

360
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,060
   

361
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:55,834
The accused confessed that he bought a bottle of soju

362
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,134
at a supermarket in the neighborhood and mixed it with chemicals,

363
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,474
but the soju mixed with chemicals

364
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:05,732
was for business use and could be sold only in bars.

365
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,483
If the accused really was the culprit,

366
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,683
why would she tell a meaningless lie

367
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:14,088
when she was coming clean anyway?

368
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,854
Agricultural chemicals weren't found anywhere

369
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,453
in her house, school, and others.

370
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,763
It was found in Jung's house when he wasn't even farming.

371
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,220
Would it be a simple coincidence?

372
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,334
Your Honor, the attorney is misleading the facts

373
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,504
with subjective speculations instead of objective evidence.

374
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:34,774
Your Honor, Jung was addicted to gambling.

375
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,273
He had previous convictions.

376
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:39,013
Including the victim, his friend of 30 years,

377
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:42,284
he borrowed a lot of money from his acquaintances to gamble.

378
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,883
A few days before the accident,

379
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:48,584
the victim pressed Jung to pay him back by beating him up harshly.

380
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,483
Also, the day before the accident,

381
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,654
Jung called the victim out to make up with each other.

382
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:56,163
They had a drink together at a bar.

383
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:59,794
The victim took the leftover drink home with him.

384
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:02,564
Jung had the motives to murder the victim,

385
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:05,804
which were resentment, grudges, and debts.

386
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:09,003
He also had the chance to murder the victim

387
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,672
by adding chemicals to the drink,

388
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:17,454
and in his death note, Jung apologized to the victim.

389
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:19,983
This can be interpreted that Jung murdered the victim,

390
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:23,854
felt guilty, became scared of getting punishment,

391
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:27,023
and thus killed himself.

392
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:29,908
Jung's death note?

393
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,960
How do you know what's written on it?

394
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:38,294
I heard it from the bereaved

395
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:41,425
who read the note.

396
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:44,721
Then isn't it inadmissible?

397
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:49,713
No one in this courtroom has ever read that death note.

398
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:52,284
You shouldn't be using it to defend the accused.

399
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:55,584
That's right. It's inadmissible.

400
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:59,453
However, the original copy of his death note is admissible.

401
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:02,023
The police are keeping his death note, the case report,

402
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:03,494
and other case records.

403
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:08,763
Those must be reviewed, and the evidence must be investigated.

404
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:13,088
Hereby, I request the documents regarding the case.

405
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,543
   

406
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:23,413
The defense's request is unnecessary.

407
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:25,894
We will not grant it.

408
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:30,384
If someone else is proven to be the real culprit in this case,

409
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:33,094
it will work as strong rebutting evidence

410
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:34,794
to prove that the accused didn't commit the murder.

411
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:37,364
Why is it unnecessary?

412
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:42,433
This trial is about the accused's criminal action.

413
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:46,134
It's not about whether the late Jung murdered the victim.

414
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,376
I'm not claiming to punish the dead man.

415
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:51,743
The dead man may be the culprit.

416
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:54,584
The accused may not be the culprit.

417
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:58,453
I only want to confirm if it's reasonable suspicion.

418
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,673
We will end the trial here.

419
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,754
Prosecution, demand a penalty.

420
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:08,223
Your Honor, then I request to interview the accused.

421
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,463
That also will not be granted.

422
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:12,763
If you have a claim to make, submit a defense summary.

423
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:16,003
It's the defense's right to interview the accused!

424
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:18,663
- Prosecution, demand a penalty. 
 - Yes, Your Honor.

425
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:22,404
In order to receive a large sum of insurance,

426
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,413
she intentionally murdered her father.

427
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,814
For this inhumane act of crime,

428
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:29,354
we demand the judges to punish her severely.

429
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,318
This is unfair!

430
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,396
This is unfair!

431
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,953
This is just unfair!

432
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:40,541
It's unfair...

433
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,523
I...

434
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,484
No, I...

435
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:29,004
 Those who passed the bar exam must go through six months 

436
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:32,043
 of practical training or internship, 

437
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:34,943
 before they can take a case, defend a client, 

438
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:39,188
 interview attorneys, and so on. 

439
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:41,384
 However, the Korean Bar Association suddenly announced 

440
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:45,526
 that they would accept a limited number of trainees 

441
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:47,894
 when successful bar exam applicants 

442
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,923
 weren't reduced in number as they wanted. 

443
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,231
 This was a forewarning of power abuse. 

444
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:57,673
 Such a restriction was lifted afterward, 

445
00:25:57,673 --> 00:26:00,534
 but it's concerning that a similar incident 

446
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:03,636
 may happen in the future. 

447
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:06,843
 I see. You've expressed your concern regarding the current situation, 

448
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:12,152
 then why do you think the Korean Bar Association took this measure? 

449
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,773
I can't do this anymore.

450
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:09,673
Every time that old man touches my body, I feel disgusted!

451
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:14,078
Yes, I know. I know it very well.

452
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:18,804
He killed my mother and made me rot in jail for 20 years,

453
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:24,390
but forget about revenge and money.

454
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,894
It's just killing me to see

455
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,623
that 80-year-old man's drooping buttocks.

456
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:31,443
I can't sleep in the same bed with him anymore!

457
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,582
So...

458
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,917
when is it?

459
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,938
When is that darn timing?

460
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:59,011
You see, I'm not an attention seeker.

461
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,663
I may be in a foul situation right now,

462
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:08,394
but I used to handle billions of dollars, not just a few hundred million.

463
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,503
When my attorneys visit me,

464
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:13,474
they still treat me with respect like when I was a chairman.

465
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:17,743
I hate being in a scandal,

466
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,528
but...

467
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:24,532
Yes, it's true I committed a crime

468
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:28,584
but this is just impersonal.

469
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,208
I'm sorry.

470
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:37,371
I can't believe I'm being treated so poorly at an old age.

471
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:43,454
I'm sorry, but the Human Rights Commission

472
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:47,003
was the only place I could reach to complain.

473
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,168
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,646
The prosecution

475
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,314
has a long way to go.

476
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,794
It's not because of how they treat me.

477
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:05,426
It's objectively not right.

478
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:10,011
They have a long way with people like Han Hye Ryul.

479
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,423
The prosecution must be reformed

480
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:17,404
because of these people!

481
00:29:17,404 --> 00:29:19,186
They must be!

482
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:27,473
I see you're enjoying it.

483
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,937
Long time no see.

484
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:34,283
Goodness. Look who's here.

485
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:37,823
Of course, it feels really good.

486
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:40,294
I even want to dance around here.

487
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:43,464
This won't be able to evade legal punishment.

488
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:47,093
But there's still a big variable left.

489
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,964
Right, but it's just a variable.

490
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:51,646
Very unable.

491
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,474
Is that supposed to be a joke?

492
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:56,475
Gosh.

493
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,343
What I mean is, whatever happens, will hardly change the situation.

494
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:02,283
We just need to have that wench pull out of investigating Jusung.

495
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,543
What else can be a problem?

496
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,484
The public sentiment. It's the most important one.

497
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,384
Are you talking about that kiss scene?

498
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,698
That's just stupid.

499
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:12,753
Goodness.

500
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:15,324
That lunacy was all over the news,

501
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,464
but it cannot cover the fact

502
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:20,763
that a prosecutor threatened a prisoner to tell a lie.

503
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,634
Not everyone's going to believe that.

504
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,533
If not? What can they do?

505
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,874
It's true you went to the golf range.

506
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,404
Why would you bring that up here?

507
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:32,114
If you mess with those with the public's support,

508
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:35,413
facts will always backfire on you.

509
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,984
The variable could actually come back to bite you.

510
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:40,164
Let's stop this stupid talk!

511
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:44,993
Goodness, Mr. Ahn, Mr. Yoon!

512
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:48,733
What a pleasure to run into you here!

513
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,723
What...

514
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,163
Mr. Yoon,

515
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,664
I heard you're a regular at this sauna,

516
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:55,763
so I went the extra mile to buy a membership.

517
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:58,734
You went the extra mile for something meaningless.

518
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,458
Enjoy the sauna.

519
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:08,058
What are you, an actress?

520
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,924
Were you filming a movie or something?

521
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,954
Just quit being a prosecutor,

522
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,724
and become an actress. You're pretty, tall, and glamorous.

523
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,584
An adult movie actress will do.

524
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,923
You like being captured that way.

525
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,183
Click.

526
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,006
You see,

527
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:29,033
if a creditor uses

528
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,474
the other's difficult situation to make them pay back,

529
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,303
that will still be considered illegal.

530
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:35,204
Now, he may have committed a crime,

531
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:40,214
but you shouldn't have threatened a poor prisoner for your own good.

532
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,884
Oh, no!

533
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:43,843
Are you crazy?

534
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:45,628
Have you gone insane?

535
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:50,154
Or were you so eager to take over the Blue House?

536
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:56,163
Did you feel rushed because it seemed you were almost

537
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,993
there to seize it?

538
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,894
Is that why you made use of that cornered prisoner?

539
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:03,702
But you know what?

540
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:07,610
It's always the mirage that seems closer.

541
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:12,975
I admit to my mistake.

542
00:32:13,874 --> 00:32:16,543
Have you decided to act nonchalantly this time?

543
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:19,084
Okay. Do you admit to it?

544
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,286
Okay.

545
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:26,247
I hope you keep that attitude even at the Disciplinary Committee.

546
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,224
Let's take it easy.

547
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:32,516
We don't want to argue and hurt each other's feelings.

548
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,712
I'll submit to the punishment.

549
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:37,894
I can cut down on snacks for a few months.

550
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:40,334
It might be frustrating, but considering my action,

551
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,843
I should bear with a few months of a wage cut.

552
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:44,979
All right.

553
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:47,413
One must dream big.

554
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:51,610
Of course, you may voice your wish.

555
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:59,224
Thanks for sharing your small... No, your huge wish with me.

556
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:03,284
First, you'll be excluded from work.

557
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,247
You can't do that.

558
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:12,534
You may have done everything as you pleased,

559
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,603
but you can't do the same with a punishment.

560
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:18,273
It's not something you can choose.

561
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,874
It's up to me. Me, your superior,

562
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,284
and you're subject to the punishment I give.

563
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:26,414
Article 2 of the Prosecution Discipline Act.

564
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:30,183
You have damaged your reputation and dignity as a prosecutor,

565
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:33,853
not to mention violating your duties.

566
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,526
So shut up!

567
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:40,342
Shut your mouth.

568
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:41,664
Okay?

569
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:46,904
Pull out of the investigation and hand over all the materials.

570
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:48,103
I can't do that.

571
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:50,803
Let me tell you again.

572
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:56,780
You're subject to the punishment, and I get to make the call.

573
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:58,604
Me!

574
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,664
Thank you.

575
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,068
Senior,

576
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:15,634
are you okay?

577
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:18,503
It's just the worst of the cases I expected.

578
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:22,327
But the public chose your side.

579
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,194
Yes, that's why I'm acting out,

580
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:30,843
but I made the cornered prisoner suffer in the waiting cell

581
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:33,991
and went to enjoy my dinner appointment.

582
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,884
That's worth a punishment.

583
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:39,153
He's not a cornered prisoner.

584
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,693
The Human Rights Commission, Ministry of Justice,

585
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:45,193
and Human Rights Department are all excited to make this an issue.

586
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:47,141
That rat

587
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:49,273
is a professional liar.

588
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,944
All right. I'll be suspended.

589
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:57,344
Aside from how many months it will be,

590
00:34:57,344 --> 00:35:01,643
he will make me pull out of the Jusung case completely.

591
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,352
But we've taken it this far.

592
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:07,666
What do we do now?

593
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,054
It's not supposed to be

594
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:13,823
this hard for a prosecutor to investigate a case fairly.

595
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:16,193
Why must we mind the powerful?

596
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:17,793
Prosecutor Oh,

597
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:20,141
the Korean prosecution

598
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:23,603
has been with the powerful since the national foundation.

599
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:28,443
Then regardless of seniority, are there only two sides outright?

600
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:31,795
You exchange jokes over a drink one day,

601
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:36,054
and you betray each other on another day, based on who holds the power.

602
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:37,444
It's only natural.

603
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,484
People criticize you for being a political prosecutor

604
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:42,668
because you act like politicians.

605
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:45,410
Can you not do that to me?

606
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,314
Senior,

607
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,443
what are you talking about?

608
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:52,480
How can you ask me such a question?

609
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,863
This really hurts my feelings.

610
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:59,876
Don't feel burdened by what I just said,

611
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,284
in any kind of situation.

612
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:05,038
Senior, I'm going to get mad for real.

613
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,852
I can be angry too.

614
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,984
Oh, really?

615
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:13,088
You cute brat!

616
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,630
I'll leave work early today.

617
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,934
The weather is too good,

618
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,354
unlike how I feel.

619
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,830
Senior!

620
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,341
What?

621
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:33,028
I think my heart just skipped a beat.

622
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,670
Hey, this one was funny.

623
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:42,944
Go on a date with your girlfriend, and enjoy this nice weather.

624
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:44,592
Bye.

625
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:55,823
I must be crazy.

626
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:00,164
I sure am.

627
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,934
Yes, leave work from there.

628
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,378
I'll drive myself.

629
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,944
You guys are insane.

630
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:51,884
   

631
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:58,393
The police can't dare threaten criminals nowadays.

632
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:01,306
How can you be this thoughtless?

633
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:03,364
To threaten him, you even went to Korea Correctional Service.

634
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,393
Why don't you just kill me?

635
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:07,663
Everyone has their eye on us since we got investigative power.

636
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,748
Just set an example by killing me!

637
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:13,481
- We didn't— 
 - Don't even say a word!

638
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:16,814
Or I'll beat you up to death and go to prison myself!

639
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,185
   

640
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:30,023
Since this much heat is on us,

641
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:34,023
it must be quite serious for Ms. Han. What do we do?

642
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:37,163
We aren't in a place to worry about her now.

643
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,393
We may be disciplined too. Come to your senses.

644
00:38:39,393 --> 00:38:42,273
I've never seen our boss this angry before.

645
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,560
Oh, let me step outside for a bit.

646
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,644
Where are you going in this situation? Hey!

647
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:52,841
Ji Gu Won!

648
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:58,056
This is very not like you.

649
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:00,636
You're worried about whom?

650
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:03,424
You used to belittle me so much, but you came here

651
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,962
to ask me to help Han Hye Ryul?

652
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:08,594
This is starting to feel upsetting.

653
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:11,793
I'm being reminded of all your mistreatment.

654
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:16,365
Come on, Eun Mi. You know a lot about Christmas Fund.

655
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:17,964
Could there be any way?

656
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,734
What's wrong with you?

657
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,473
Why are you being anxious about Ms. Han's punishment?

658
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:24,873
I mean, no one will be there to dig into Christmas Fund

659
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:26,514
if Ms. Han pulls out of it.

660
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:29,094
It's too dangerous for anyone to take over.

661
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:33,514
I'm sorry, but you're such a horrible actor.

662
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:35,924
I guess Mr. Wang was right.

663
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,884
He wondered if you liked her.

664
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:40,353
What? What are you talking about?

665
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:43,123
Joong Jin, this brat! He shouldn't have said such nonsense!

666
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:45,963
Gu Won, there's no need to get worked up.

667
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,534
You aren't the only one who likes her.

668
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:49,633
Tons of people like her!

669
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:53,634
Her supporters are called her fans. She's like an idol prosecutor.

670
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:56,903
To see you get flustered and serious, I find it even more suspicious.

671
00:39:56,903 --> 00:39:59,014
Fine.

672
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,868
I'm worried about her.

673
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:04,563
Show me what you have up your sleeve.

674
00:40:06,414 --> 00:40:09,286
I shared it with her a long time ago.

675
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:10,224
What?

676
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,454
Dolphin's embargoed letter,

677
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,194
which exposed how prosecutors took bribes,

678
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:17,554
I shared it with her before it was reported on the news.

679
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:22,042
 You should know. 

680
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,204
 Why is that? 

681
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:28,833
 Their goal is you. 

682
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:44,423
It was so scandalous that it took me the courage to give it to her,

683
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:46,093
but she didn't use that card.

684
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:49,389
It totally changed my view of her.

685
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:51,733
Korean politics is like a dogfight.

686
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,194
They're all shortsighted.

687
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,163
They fall into the trap they set up.

688
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,963
They talk themselves into their own demise. They're all like that.

689
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,615
They're like thugs.

690
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:04,886
If Han Hye Ryul went ahead and revealed the letter herself,

691
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:07,704
they'd be in deep trouble now.

692
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,774
She really is different.

693
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:13,614
Maybe she should really run for president later on.

694
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:16,323
What? President?

695
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:18,753
And the Christmas Fund jerks.

696
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:21,223
They got mad at me for not writing exactly what they told me to write,

697
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:22,824
so they joined hands with MBS long ago.

698
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:23,894
What do they want from me now?

699
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:26,434
Gosh, I don't know! I have no idea what to do,

700
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:29,020
unless we can magically figure out a solution.

701
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:42,537
What's with that face?

702
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:46,371
Oh, I guess you finally got dumped.

703
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,327
I don't think this is a joke.

704
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,094
If this is a joke, they're dead meat.

705
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:55,064
If it isn't, they're putting their life on the line.

706
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:56,523
What is it?

707
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:58,547
You know,

708
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,804
I'm incredibly lucky.

709
00:42:01,804 --> 00:42:04,103
Or is Han Hye Ryul the lucky one here?

710
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:06,644
Hey, what is it?

711
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:12,114
What on earth is this?

712
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,973
What do you think?

713
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:17,938
A solution that magically fell into my lap.

714
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,203
   

715
00:42:21,784 --> 00:42:23,990
   

716
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:30,523
   

717
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:33,694
   

718
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:36,034
That brazen wench!

719
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:38,703
I couldn't believe it when I found out.

720
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,634
No wonder she looked familiar.

721
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:44,196
She's asking to get killed.

722
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:52,440
 That's why she's here. 

723
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:56,358
 How dare she set foot in here? 

724
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,010
   

725
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:24,904
   

726
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:47,433
   

727
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,402
 Hello! 

728
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,942
 - Oh, hello. 
 - Hello. 

729
00:43:52,514 --> 00:43:54,514
 Hello. 

730
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,654
 Hello. 

731
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:01,984
 How did it go? 

732
00:44:01,984 --> 00:44:05,453
 We don't know yet. They're still talking in Mr. Hong's office. 

733
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:07,342
 It'll go well. 

734
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,264
 Is it a yes? 

735
00:44:14,264 --> 00:44:15,990
   

736
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,814
 - Thank you. 
 - No problem. 

737
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:29,950
 Thank you. 

738
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,376
 Oh my, the news traveled fast. 

739
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:35,624
 She's my daughter. 

740
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:38,583
 Of course, she should be the first one to hear the news. 

741
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:40,624
 You must love your daughter the most in the whole wide world. 

742
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:43,026
 Yes, that's right. 

743
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:46,595
 Your daughter is very beautiful. 

744
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:50,910
 She's studying computer science at Kaist now. 

745
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,304
 And she's smart too. 

746
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:57,104
 She's pure talent. 

747
00:44:57,104 --> 00:45:00,706
 Yes, I think so too. 

748
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:02,383
 Come on, Dad. 

749
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:05,684
 My dad is too honest for his own good. 

750
00:45:05,684 --> 00:45:10,046
 He's terrible at lying, and he can't hide anything. 

751
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:15,008
 He poured his heart and soul into developing this technology. 

752
00:45:15,623 --> 00:45:17,912
 I hope it all works out! 

753
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:19,742
 My gosh. 

754
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:23,750
 - All right. Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 

755
00:45:30,443 --> 00:45:31,574
 Hey. 

756
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:35,784
 You just started college. How come you can already drink so much? 

757
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:37,384
 Dad, it's so weird. 

758
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:40,353
 I never get drunk, no matter how many beers I drink. It's like water. 

759
00:45:40,353 --> 00:45:41,984
 Then just drink water. 

760
00:45:41,984 --> 00:45:44,054
 Why must you drink booze? It's a waste of money. 

761
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:45,754
 It's like tasty water. 

762
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:47,720
 My goodness. 

763
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:51,563
 You can drink me under the table, just like your mother. 

764
00:45:51,563 --> 00:45:55,134
 I never once saw her get drunk. 

765
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:57,674
 I always got drunk before she did. 

766
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:02,675
 Dad, 

767
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:05,673
 then are we going to become rich now? 

768
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:07,643
 Are we going to have wine instead of beer 

769
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,913
 and Hanwoo steaks instead of sausages? 

770
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:12,983
 We've only taken the first step, so let's not get too greedy. 

771
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:15,284
 To meet the production yield targets they requested, 

772
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:18,123
 we'll have to double the current production output. 

773
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:20,054
 - We'll have to hire more people too. 
 - Okay. 

774
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:23,964
 Then after that, we'll become rich, right? 

775
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:25,563
 Well, I froze everyone's salary last year. 

776
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:30,464
 I'll give everyone a raise and raise your allowance too. 

777
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:32,844
 Yes! 

778
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:39,173
 To tell you the truth, 

779
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:42,844
 they brought a lawyer, so I was very intimidated. 

780
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:44,944
 I mean, Jusung is a huge company. 

781
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:48,754
 The lawyer was from Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, the biggest law firm. 

782
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,453
 - You saw the lawyer earlier. 
 - Yes. 

783
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:52,993
 He is from Ham &amp; Lee law corporation, 

784
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:56,364
 but their offer was better than I had expected. 

785
00:46:56,364 --> 00:47:01,488
 So I... Hey, slow down! 

786
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,434
 Dad! Stop nagging me, will you? 

787
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:05,063
 Come on, it's a happy day! 

788
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:07,343
 - Yes, it is but— 
 - Here, eat this. 

789
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,603
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers. 

790
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:13,263
 - We can do it. 
 - We can do it. 

791
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:18,954
 Oh, that's our key technology. 

792
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:22,134
 I'm afraid I can't provide you with that information. 

793
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,784
 It's required for quality control and defect inspection purposes. 

794
00:47:24,784 --> 00:47:27,994
 It's one of Jusung's conditions, and it's completely legal. 

795
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:32,976
 However, the information they're requesting is very detailed. 

796
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,534
 We haven't obtained a patent yet, 

797
00:47:35,534 --> 00:47:38,474
 so there's nothing we can do once it gets leaked. 

798
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:40,938
 "Once it gets leaked?" 

799
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:43,743
 Do you not trust us? 

800
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:46,514
 No, it's not that. 

801
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:47,913
 Mr. Hong, if you keep this up, 

802
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:52,637
 we'll have no choice but to tell Jusung to annul the contract. 

803
00:47:55,154 --> 00:47:57,254
 If you look at the contract... 

804
00:47:58,523 --> 00:48:00,363
 Here, Article 12.3. 

805
00:48:00,363 --> 00:48:03,854
 It states that you must cooperate with all inspections. 

806
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,514
 Article 21.1 states 

807
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,433
 that Jusung reserves the right to cancel the contract, 

808
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:12,734
 should you neglect or fail to fulfill 

809
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:14,833
 your obligations stated in Article 12 and 15, 

810
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:19,466
 and you must compensate Jusung for any loss or damage. 

811
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:22,683
 I went over this part with you several times. 

812
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:26,354
 Even without such documents, they can certainly conduct inspections. 

813
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:28,953
 Also, I can guarantee the product's quality. 

814
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:30,654
 I don't do sloppy work. 

815
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,994
 - I take pride in my work— 
 - You see, 

816
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:35,393
 we don't need your verbal guarantee. 

817
00:48:35,393 --> 00:48:38,073
 Legally, we need everything done perfectly. 

818
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:40,163
 Many companies act like they have novel technologies, 

819
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:42,839
 which isn't really true. 

820
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,804
 I've seen it one too many times. 

821
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:47,204
 As a lawyer, I can't guarantee anything. 

822
00:48:48,304 --> 00:48:52,266
 If I were to be held responsible down the road... 

823
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,409
 I can't do it. 

824
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:58,143
 I devoted my life to developing this technology, 

825
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,908
 so please don't say that. 

826
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:08,804
 Since I'm here anyway, it'd be great if I could get copies of the files. 

827
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,092
 Yes. 

828
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,966
 Okay. 

829
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:44,090
 What did they say? 

830
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,493
 They can't pay us more. 

831
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,563
 They said they had to cut the cost. 

832
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:50,863
 What? 

833
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,973
 Sir, so we have to slash our rates? 

834
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:56,004
 We're technically doing the work for free! 

835
00:49:56,004 --> 00:49:59,114
 - They're hanging us out to dry. 
 - What can we do? 

836
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:00,744
 We expanded the factory 

837
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:03,043
 to increase our production line output for them. 

838
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,728
 So if Jusung pulls out, 

839
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:08,083
 we'll have to close down the factory. 

840
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:10,723
 On top of that, the loan is another problem. 

841
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:15,154
 Well, we're not the only ones in a pickle. 

842
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:18,063
 Other companies can't even make it. 

843
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:21,328
 What makes them so confident? 

844
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:23,748
 I wonder too. 

845
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:30,703
 Sir, we've got a big problem! 

846
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:33,368
 - What is it? 
 - Here. 

847
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:35,743
 Here, Dayeon made this. 

848
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:38,580
 The eldest son of the Jusung family is the CEO of the company. 

849
00:50:48,993 --> 00:50:50,577
 What is this? 

850
00:50:50,577 --> 00:50:54,634
 It's exactly the same as the one we made. 

851
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,054
 This is ours! 

852
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:04,044
 Gosh, this is nuts. 

853
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:19,123
 Come in. 

854
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:28,293
 How did it go? 

855
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,145
 As you said, they want to adjust it. 

856
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:35,168
 Gosh, they're so predictable. 

857
00:51:35,168 --> 00:51:39,149
 Why did they resist in the first place? 

858
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:42,173
 Why do you keep going off? 

859
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:45,344
 I already finished getting rid of technical data. 

860
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:48,284
 I requested inspection data on the phone and copied it myself. 

861
00:51:48,284 --> 00:51:50,264
 There's no evidence. 

862
00:51:50,264 --> 00:51:52,724
 I'm going to make it look like a legal acquisition, 

863
00:51:52,724 --> 00:51:54,793
 instead of an extortion of technical data, 

864
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:58,293
 so I have the props ready too. 

865
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:01,182
 Professor Hyun helped me. 

866
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:03,003
 How thankful. 

867
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:07,403
 This is why you need friends. 

868
00:52:07,403 --> 00:52:11,174
 One in the court, one in the prosecution service, and one in Fair Trade Commission. 

869
00:52:11,174 --> 00:52:14,736
 How nice it is to have them. 

870
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,483
 You must always have a reason. 

871
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,383
 Even if they want to cut you some slack, 

872
00:52:18,383 --> 00:52:22,054
 there must be a loophole for them to let you slide, 

873
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:26,354
 so don't forget your backup. 

874
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:28,447
 Thank you. 

875
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:31,494
 The old saying is always right. 

876
00:52:31,494 --> 00:52:36,884
 "A friend in need is a friend indeed." That's the one. 

877
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:41,433
 I got rid of the internal report that confirms  reproducing the data is impossible. 

878
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:45,403
 Professor Hyun will rewrite the report according to the result. 

879
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:50,216
 No one is an authority as Professor Hyun in the field. 

880
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:51,784
 Who will go against his opinion? 

881
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:54,713
 Even if someone does, who will buy that? 

882
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,384
 It's game over. 

883
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:59,293
 Of course. He's a professor at Seoul National University. 

884
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:01,753
 The judges and prosecutors can't complain. 

885
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:04,677
 From now on, buy as much time as you can. 

886
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:08,133
 Time is gold, but it's diamond to them. 

887
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:10,534
 A long illness wears out even a good son's filial devotion, 

888
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:12,304
 and a long trial wears out even a good prosecutor. 

889
00:53:12,304 --> 00:53:19,422
 Once it settles, sue the owner for obstruction of business. 

890
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:23,334
 How dare he file a suit against Jusung and us? 

891
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,548
 What a crazy punk. 

892
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:34,780
 Yes. Isn't that nice? 

893
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,564
 Go in when I hit you. 

894
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:41,488
 Why act stubborn and get hit more? 

895
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:44,661
   

896
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:27,527
   

897
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,688
 Dad! 

898
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,713
 Oh, no! 

899
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,837
 Dad! 

900
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,596
 No! 

901
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,652
 Dad! 

902
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,708
Are you Ms. Hong Nan Hee?

903
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,324
CEO Han told me to take you to his office.

904
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:49,406
This way, please.

905
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:03,213
We're going to miss it. Let's hurry up.

906
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,168
Come in.

907
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,762
You look familiar.

908
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:47,372
Oh, yes.

909
00:56:49,383 --> 00:56:51,903
What brought you here?

910
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:55,384
I have business with Attorney Han Gun Do.

911
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,893
I don't know what your game is.

912
00:57:00,893 --> 00:57:04,562
Is it money? Or is it him?

913
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:07,503
Don't worry.

914
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:11,927
Neither your father nor your husband is my type.

915
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:18,970
We're here.

916
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:27,338
Hey! How dare you mention my husband?

917
00:57:27,338 --> 00:57:31,393
Everyone in this family says, "How dare you," as a habit all the time.

918
00:57:31,393 --> 00:57:33,693
You don't even know what your husband is up to.

919
00:57:33,693 --> 00:57:35,963
Stop acting up! You don't know anything!

920
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:39,003
Go ask your dad!

921
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:42,634
See what Ham &amp; Lee, no, Han Gun Do's personal x-file on Jusung says

922
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:45,073
about your husband.

923
00:57:45,073 --> 00:57:46,773
Drug?

924
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:49,544
Women?

925
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:56,054
How come all the third-generation conglomerates are so predictable?

926
00:57:56,054 --> 00:58:00,636
Do you know what you're doing?

927
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,752
What am I doing?

928
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:11,082
Asking for death.

929
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:46,444
 I'll meet you at the place between 11 p.m. and 11:20 p.m. 

930
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:53,336
 I believe my conditions meet the public interest. 

931
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:55,514
 I'm not asking you to write an article 

932
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:59,856
 for my father's wrongful death or my personal grudge. 

933
00:58:59,856 --> 00:59:03,684
 However, if you help me, I'll give you all evidence 

934
00:59:03,684 --> 00:59:05,854
 on the deal between Jusung, Ham &amp; Lee, and prosecutors, 

935
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:10,378
 as their punishment and a return for your favor. 

936
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:15,236
 The attachment is only part of it. 

937
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:37,910



938
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:44,160
    
♫  Tell me  ♫

939
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,550
♫  It's okay for any reason  ♫

940
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:03,180
♫  Did someone cover my eyes  ♫

941
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:17,380
♫  Tell me why I'm your tag  ♫

942
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,940
♫  Even if I shake my hand and hold it  ♫

943
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,960
♫  Scattered silence  ♫

944
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,273
 How did you... Who are you? 

945
01:00:29,273 --> 01:00:31,374
 Apologize to me. 

946
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:33,543
 Why are you doing this? Why! 

947
01:00:33,543 --> 01:00:36,713
 What wrong have I done to you? 

948
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:38,943
 For how long do you expect me to live like this? 

949
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:42,314
 A disobedient dog doesn't get kicked out. It gets killed instead. 

950
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:46,402
 Aren't you curious about how much I know? 

951
01:00:46,402 --> 01:00:48,293
 Whose mouth was the culprit trying to shut? 

952
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:51,560
 It's them. Those people. 

953
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,970
♫  Standing in front of me  ♫
