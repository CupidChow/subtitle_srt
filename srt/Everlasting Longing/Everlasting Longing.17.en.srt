How are your eyes feeling?

18
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,430
Qingkou's medicine is effective.

19
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,550
I'm fine now.

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,790
Mr. Sun's funeral arrangements are complete.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
I'll keep Zhaomin company these days.

22
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,840
Mr. Sun died because of me.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
I must give Zhaomin

24
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,910
and the Sun Clan an explanation.

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Don't blame yourself too much.

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Could it be you

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
have seen this?

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,750
Dad, look.

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,220
(Crossbow Diagram)

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,120
Qiluo,

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,470
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,840
To save your uncle

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,840
and preserve the family's wealth,

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I sold your diagram.

35
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,680
The buyer

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,080
paid a lot.

37
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,710
With that,

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,280
our family can rise again

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,960
and get our feet set in Royal Capital.

40
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,800
Dad, do not feel guilty.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,590
This is my only talent,

42
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,400
and if it helps the family, it's a blessing.

43
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,870
Besides, it was my uncle's mistake,

44
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,840
not yours, Dad.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,630
These don't seem like Beixuan's weapons.

46
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,030
It was taken from my father

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,840
20 years ago.

48
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,030
Qiluo,

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,030
why are you interested in it?

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Such an important item

51
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
should be kept safe.

52
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,680
Your eyes just healed.

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,470
You should get more rest.

54
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,870
I have to go.

55
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,040
(Does Qiluo know something?)

56
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,110
Fanyin.

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Fanyin.

58
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm sorry for not returning
to Xixiang on time.

59
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,270
Don't be mad.

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,070
Look, I made a kite just for you.

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,510
I don't want your kite.

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Didn't you promise

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,870
to come back in spring?

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,480
Now it's already autumn.

65
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,240
Father intensified my training

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,160
to groom me for the clan leader.

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
Come on.

68
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,800
It's all my fault.

69
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,480
I shouldn't have come back so late.

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,070
Please forgive me for the kite's sake.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
Look.

72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,510
I struggled to fly back from Beixuan.

73
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,750
I almost got shot down several times.

74
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,630
Please have mercy on me.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
You poor little bird.

76
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,560
If it can fly high and far,

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
I might just forgive you.

78
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,000
Rest assured.

79
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,430
It will surely fly high and far.

80
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,670
Come on.

81
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,470
My Lord.

82
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,070
What's with the trap in the bamboo forest?

83
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,510
I told you to set a trap to hold Lie off,

84
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,510
why did Mr. Sun end up dead there?

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
My Lord,

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,720
I remolded the trap without permission.

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,950
How dare you?

88
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,190
If not for Mr. Sun's sacrifice,

89
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,480
Lie would've been the one dead.

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,510
You spared General Lie's life several times,

91
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,680
but he easily escaped each time.

92
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I want to help you get the position

93
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
and improve your odds.

94
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,510
The Wolf Lord's position

95
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,870
belongs to Lie anyway.

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,630
You have a deep bond

97
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,640
and couldn't hurt him.

98
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
But ever since you decided to go after it,

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
it was destined you could never go back.

100
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,720
The struggle

101
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
will result in casualties.

102
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,160
If you don't want to disappoint Consort Li,

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,390
sacrificing him will be the only way.

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,950
According to the rules,

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
if the clan leader ranks first

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
in the event dies,

107
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,160
the position will pass on.

108
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,340
My Lord,

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,830
we still have a chance.

110
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
You may leave now.

111
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,830
My Lord.

112
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,800
Just leave.

113
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,670
(Why did the weapons I designed)

114
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,550
(end up in Beixuan)

115
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,720
(and kill General Xuan Shu?)

116
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,660
(Jun)

117
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,960
What's with this jade pendant?

118
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
I'm just checking

119
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,030
if it's solid.

120
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,460
(Jun)

121
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,220
(Jun)

122
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,060
(Jun)

123
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Luo Qi, He Jiyao.

124
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Young Master.

125
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
This is...

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
Jun Qiluo

127
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,630
is Baigong's heir, Jun Feifan.

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,480
That means

129
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Miss Jun

130
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,510
was involved in Mr. Xian Shu's case.

131
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,150
Even if Miss Jun is Baigong's heir,

132
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,510
she was too young 12 years ago.

133
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,750
She knew nothing then.

134
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,080
It's impossible she was involved.

135
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
I disagree.

136
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,910
Miss Jun designed weapons 12 years ago.

137
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,790
She's smart.

138
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,320
Why do you say she knows nothing?

139
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,600
Since arriving in Beixuan,

140
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,320
Miss Jun's aided you against Xi Changkun.

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,550
They couldn't be accomplices.

142
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,200
How do you know she's not pretending?

143
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,390
And remember

144
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,120
she is a master of calculation.

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,150
Young Master, don't listen to He Jiyao.

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,670
Miss Jun is calculating,

147
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,510
but she has a kind heart.

148
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,030
If you have doubts,

149
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,550
you can ask Miss Jun yourself.

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,590
He Jiyao,

151
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,790
tell He Woshan

152
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,000
to retrieve the crystal Miss Jun took.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Remember,

154
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,390
the crystal must not reach Yannan.

155
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Understood.

156
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,440
We haven't had a chance to celebrate.

157
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,390
I've kept some Xixiang's fine wine.

158
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,270
Want to give it a try?

159
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,030
Let's drink outside.

160
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,480
Can you think before you speak?

161
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,150
He cares for Miss Jun deeply.

162
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,270
Weren't you just hurting him
with what you said?

163
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,910
He's been investigating the case

164
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,840
for years.

165
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
Is he going to give it up

166
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,150
just for Miss Jun?

167
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,910
Can't you see he's upset?

168
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,270
He needs some time

169
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,550
to process it.

170
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,480
He is the Wolf Lord of Beixuan,

171
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,150
Xuan Lie.

172
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,510
Mr. Xi has been waiting.

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
This way.

174
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,270
My Lord, he's here.

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,840
Greetings, Mr. Xi.

176
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,320
The chancellor asked me

177
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,270
to deliver an important message.

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,200
Mr. Xi,

179
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,660
(Jun Qiluo is Baigong's heir. Kill.)

180
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,390
It seems Jun Qiluo

181
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,030
is assisting Xuan Lie with an old case.

182
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,750
You must be troubled lately,

183
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,790
trying to get rid of them both.

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,270
The woman with Xuan Lie

185
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,960
(Jun Qiluo is Baigong's heir.)
turns out to be Jun Qiluo.

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,550
She's Baigong's heir, hidden by their king.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,720
The chancellor knows the stakes.

188
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,440
So, he sent me here

189
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
to assist you.

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
If Jun Qiluo dies,

191
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,840
the case from 12 years ago will be dropped.

192
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,440
That's how you protect

193
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,270
the chancellor.

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,790
But Xuan Lie has old soldiers
as witnesses.

195
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,790
Whether Baigong's heir is dead or alive,

196
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,320
Xuan Shu's case will surely be reopened.

197
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,320
By then, you will leave,

198
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,480
leaving me to face
the king's punishment alone.

199
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,550
Is this your well-thought-out plan?

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,240
You shouldn't assume malice
from the chancellor.

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,670
The chancellor has noticed

202
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,750
your recent difficulties

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,240
and sent me to lend you a hand.

204
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,390
Jun Qiluo is with Xuan Lie.

205
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
It's not easy to deal with her.

206
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
Mr. Zheng,

207
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
how about this?

208
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,790
Take action yourself.

209
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,840
Whether it succeeds or not,

210
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,270
Xuan Lie won't suspect me.

211
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,150
Your target is Jun Qiluo anyway.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,360
What do you think?

213
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,610
(Luoma River, Mount Song, Mount Chifeng)

214
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,720
I understand your concerns.

215
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,510
I haven't thought it through.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,630
This matter needs careful planning.

217
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,510
I am willing to assist you

218
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,750
in eliminating Xi's old soldiers.

219
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,870
It was a tough journey.

220
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,750
You must be tired.

221
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,080
Have a seat.

222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,320
Enjoy some of our Beixuan delicacies

223
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,630
and take a break.

224
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,320
Thank you, Mr. Xi.

225
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,390
My Lady.

226
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,030
We stalled in Beixuan

227
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,240
for the black iron crystal.

228
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,320
But now it's been sent to Yannan.

229
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
We have no reason to stay.

230
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,630
The weapons I designed appeared.

231
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
I need to find out what's going on.

232
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,240
Those weapons were presented to the king.

233
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,600
How did it appear in Beixuan?

234
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,080
Someone might be colluding with Beixuan,

235
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,240
selling my weapons illegally.

236
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,120
The one colluding with Yannan

237
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,550
is likely Xi Changkun.

238
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
Xi Changkun?

239
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,750
Starting from him,

240
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,480
we may be able to find Yannan's mastermind.

241
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,960
If Xi Changkun is dealing weapons,

242
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,270
he must have an arsenal in Beixuan.

243
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,910
Go investigate.

244
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,120
See if you can locate the arsenal.

245
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,680
Understood.

246
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,270
Just as I entered the tent,

247
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,630
I saw Xi Lin sneaking a Yannan man

248
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,270
into the venue.

249
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,840
How can you be sure he's from Yannan?

250
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,600
His figure looked very familiar.

251
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,640
Rumor has it that a while ago,

252
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,720
Yannan merchants came to Beixuan Royal City.

253
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,270
There were 11 when they arrived,

254
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,870
but only 10 when they left.

255
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,200
Hence the speculation.

256
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Coming to Beixuan at this time,

257
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,270
he must know Xuan Lie
is reopening the old case.

258
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,910
So well-informed.

259
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
Who could it be?

260
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,960
Worrying for Miss Jun?

261
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,540
The Sacrifice Ritual is approaching.

262
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,320
Xi Changkun still resents us
over Xi Mo's death

263
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,670
and covets your position as Wolf Lord.

264
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,320
Don't let romance

265
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,670
monopolize your mind.

266
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Lie.

267
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Before the ritual,

268
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,390
it'll be Xi Changkun's last chance.

269
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,360
He will be ruthless towards you.

270
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,550
What are your plans?

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,790
Before the case is solved,

272
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,030
we can't kill him.

273
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
I must prove he had smuggled weapons

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
and was responsible for my parents
and Mr. Sun's deaths.

275
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,390
What do you mean by smuggling weapons?

276
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,550
I found the soldiers who worked with him.

277
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,960
They have the travel pass from back then.

278
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,120
But it's not enough to take him down.

279
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,150
For illegal arms dealing,

280
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,750
the most likely direct evidence

281
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,320
might be in his arsenal.

282
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,510
But Xi Changkun is so cunning.

283
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,680
Finding his arsenal won't be easy.

284
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,720
Since you're sure he's the culprit,

285
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,160
why not deal with him directly?

286
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
Do you have a plan?

287
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,880
Xi Jixiu.

288
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,270
She has feelings for you.

289
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,550
And she is the only one

290
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,590
who can make Xi Changkun drop his guard.

291
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,880
If we can use her to lure Xi Changkun,

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
we can surely eliminate him.

293
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,510
Using others' feelings to achieve a goal,

294
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,150
if you were in my place,

295
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,430
would you do it?

296
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,070
(Twelve years ago,)

297
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,070
(the Three-Arrow Crossbow
appeared in Beixuan.)

298
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,550
(But only a few)

299
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,920
(could access the designs
and Yannan's arsenal.)

300
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,440
(Also, the king didn't notice)

301
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,200
(the smuggling of weapons.)

302
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,480
(How did they manage
to sneak them into Beixuan)

303
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,880
(without being noticed?)

304
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,630
Qiluo.

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why are you drinking?

306
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,830
Winning the contest

307
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,160
and fulfilling my father's wish

308
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
brought back memories.

309
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,790
It looks like

310
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,420
Xi Changkun killed my parents

311
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,240
because he was worried
my father becoming Wolf Lord

312
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,440
would mess up his business,

313
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,240
so he silenced them in the Uncontrollable.

314
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,880
He's done evil things.

315
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,310
You will bring him to justice.

316
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,070
The weapon that killed my father

317
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,200
was crafted by Baigong's heir.

318
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,160
Do you think Baigong's heir

319
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,720
was involved in the case back then?

320
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,350
And why, of all people,

321
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,640
did they kill my father?

322
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,080
Perhaps,

323
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,720
the heir didn't expect the weapon

324
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,030
would be used on your father.

325
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,110
Is that so?

326
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,070
How do you know?

327
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,720
You understand people's hearts,

328
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,030
always guessing what they think.

329
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,440
I can trust you,

330
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
right?

331
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,670
It's late.

332
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,440
Get some rest.

333
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,590
Your Majesty,

334
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,070
the scout was sent to Beixuan yesterday.

335
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,920
Please take care

336
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,160
and don't overthink it.

337
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,240
Jun's second branch can't be fully trusted.

338
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,640
But if Jun Feifan stays in Beixuan too long,

339
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,830
there will be more complications.

340
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,070
So we must bring him back quickly.

341
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

342
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,350
Xu, I have something urgent.

343
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,070
You said you want to reopen Xian Shu's case?

344
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,590
Please grant permission.

345
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,830
I believe there's no need
to wait for the ceremony to end

346
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,750
to reopen this case.

347
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,240
So urgent you'd come at night,

348
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,920
ignoring all decorum?

349
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,350
You promised me

350
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,240
that once I become the Wolf Lord,

351
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,880
I can reopen that case.

352
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,000
I remember my promise to you.

353
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
I planned to issue the decree tomorrow,

354
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,160
but didn't expect your impatience.

355
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,590
Fine.

356
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,680
You have my permission.

357
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,720
Thank you, Xu.

358
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,200
(Central State Map)
Xi Lin brought a Yannan man

359
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
into Xi Changkun's tent.

360
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,550
In other words,

361
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,800
Xi Lin must've been involved

362
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,200
in Xian Shu's case back then.

363
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,160
Otherwise, Xi Changkun

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,030
wouldn't let him deal with that man.

365
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,270
If he is here to help Xi Changkun

366
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,880
cover up the smuggling,

367
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,350
we must act quickly.

368
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,350
Or we'll be on the defensive.

369
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,030
You already have a plan, don't you?

370
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,920
To bring down Xi Changkun,

371
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
we must act before him.

372
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
So, I plan to reveal
the location of old soldiers

373
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,270
to Xi Changkun.

374
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,630
What?

375
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,140
Xi Changkun already knows

376
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,720
you're protecting the soldiers.

377
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,440
What he wants most now

378
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,240
is to kill them

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,510
to leave you with no witnesses.

380
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,550
So, if you tell him their location,

381
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,510
he will definitely take action.

382
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,350
Luo Qi,

383
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,110
investigate Xi Lin's background.

384
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,400
He is the key in this whole game.

385
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,630
Yes.

386
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,430
Rest assured.

387
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,110
Luring Xi to the soldiers is just a trap.

388
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,030
The real plan is...

389
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,310
Here comes the king.

390
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Lie,

391
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,240
why have you gathered
the leaders of the Five Clans?

392
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
Your Majesty,

393
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,720
my subordinate reported

394
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,880
a Yannan man entered the venue yesterday.

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
We fear he might be a spy.

396
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,830
General Lie,

397
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,270
everyone knows

398
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,160
a Yannan woman is by your side.

399
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,240
Speaking of spies,

400
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,880
you should check those around you first.

401
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,350
Qiluo has always been with him.

402
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,960
Everyone can see clearly

403
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,550
if she's a spy.

404
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,720
You say she's a spy.

405
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,030
Are you implying
that the Queen Mother and king

406
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,790
give a Yannan spy

407
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,200
free rein in Beixuan?

408
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
- You!
- Zhaomin is right.

409
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,160
Qiluo is by my side daily

410
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,920
and is watched by many.

411
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,590
She can't be a spy.

412
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
Last night, the Yannan man

413
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,550
entered Beixuan as a merchant.

414
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,100
If not for a thorough check,

415
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,310
he might escape detection.

416
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,880
It's of great importance.

417
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,880
Capture that Yannan spy immediately.

418
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
I want to see for myself

419
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,680
what Zhao Guang is up to.

420
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,590
Your Majesty,

421
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,400
let me investigate his whereabouts.

422
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,270
I will not overlook

423
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,880
any corner of the venue.

424
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,240
I also request

425
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,680
to search all of Beixuan with my men.

426
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,590
We must not let him hide anywhere.

427
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,910
Xu,

428
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
my subordinates have confirmed

429
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,590
that he entered the venue.

430
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,440
We only need to search the venue.

431
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,550
No need to widen it.

432
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
I have objections.

433
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,440
If he's a Yannan spy,

434
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,830
why would he stay only in the venue?

435
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,640
I believe all of Beixuan should be searched.

436
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,590
None should be spared.

437
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,350
Thank you for speaking for Qiluo.

438
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,440
I see her as my sister.

439
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,830
No need to thank me.

440
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,510
Although I don't know

441
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,440
what your plan is.

442
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
If there's anything you need from me,

443
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,110
just let me know.

444
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,270
I will do my best to assist.

445
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,280
I will

446
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,480
when necessary.

447
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,080
Lately,

448
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
you've been busy

449
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,350
returning Mr. Sun's remains to Liangzhou.

450
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,920
If you need anything, let us know.

451
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,510
I will visit Liangzhou when I can

452
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,110
to pay my respects.

453
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,160
Thank you, General Lie.

454
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,830
I'm departing tomorrow.

455
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,550
See you in Royal City.

456
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,310
She seems to have matured.

457
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,480
Just like I did back then.

458
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
We are forced to grow up.

459
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
I hope Mr. Sun watches from above

460
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,750
and helps us find the culprit soon.

461
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,000
Today, Xuan Lie

462
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,310
tried to use the Yannan spy

463
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,440
to bring me down.

464
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,030
But I took this chance

465
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
to search the entire Beixuan instead.

466
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,830
Xuan Lie will surely guess

467
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,480
you're searching all of Beixuan

468
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,550
to find Xi's old soldiers.

469
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,880
He will do everything he can

470
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,830
to lead them out of your sight.

471
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,640
I have marked on the map

472
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,200
their possible hiding places.

473
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Keep an eye on Xuan Lie and his group.

474
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,480
Avoid direct confrontation with them.

475
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,430
Kill the soldiers only.

476
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,390
Yes.

477
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,620
Mr. Xi,

478
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,590
Luo Zhizhou is about
to search the entire venue.

479
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,510
I'm afraid I will be exposed.

480
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,030
Rest assured.

481
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,510
I will protect you.

482
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,830
My Lord, nothing was found.

483
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
Mr. Xi Lin,

484
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,830
how could you be so careless?

485
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,280
Everyone,

486
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,110
kill them!

487
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,720
Calm down, Mr. Xi.

488
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,480
You're no match.

489
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,110
General Luo,

490
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,680
that was quick.

491
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,270
You just set off to search now?

492
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,550
The Royal City is vast.

493
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,830
I need to plan carefully before acting.

494
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,910
I see.

495
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll just make it quick.

496
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,680
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

497
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
Thank you, Mr. Xi.

498
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Why are you laughing?

499
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Mr. Luo,

500
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,510
you and General Lie are like brothers.

501
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,880
One in the light, the other in the dark.

502
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,590
What do you mean?

503
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
We both know it well.

504
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,680
I know you want that position.

505
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,550
But considering your friendship,

506
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,880
you didn't want to fight General Lie.

507
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,400
But he has been using you and Mr. Sun

508
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
to stop me

509
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,160
just to protect himself.

510
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,030
You've seen what happened to Mr. Sun.

511
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,350
Now there's a Yannan spy issue.

512
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,880
I wonder if that Yannan woman plotted it

513
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,880
with General Lie.

514
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,440
We both understand the situation.

515
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,790
We must not let him succeed.

516
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,310
My Lord, nothing's suspicious.

517
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,950
Mr. Luo,

518
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,310
I've said all I needed to.

519
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,000
I have to go now.

520
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,400
Deputy Xi.

521
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,720
Long time no see.

522
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,870
You traitor.

523
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,240
The Xi Clan treated you well.

524
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,550
Yet you joined the Xuan Clan.

525
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,200
The smuggling 12 years ago,

526
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,110
you were involved, right?

527
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,590
What?

528
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,160
Stop playing dumb.

529
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,480
They've confessed everything

530
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,310
about Xi Changkun's smuggling.

531
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,880
Back then, it was you

532
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,550
who chased them into the forest.

533
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,070
I don't understand.

534
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,400
I chased him because he betrayed the Xi Clan.

535
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,200
That's all I know.

536
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,480
General Lie,

537
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,590
I've been ordered to search Beixuan,

538
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,270
and you tied me up.

539
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,440
That's obstruction of an official proceeding.

540
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Xi Changkun trained a group of elite soldiers

541
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
for smuggling.

542
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,960
They all have this totem.

543
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,150
And you still won't admit it?

544
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,240
The Cangshui Army all bear this totem.

545
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,030
What's the big deal?

546
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,240
Tough, huh?

547
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,110
Twelve Light Cavalry.

548
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,190
Ay.

549
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,880
Search everyone carefully.

550
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,640
Those without a totem are not Cangshui Army.

551
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,840
Eliminate them all.

552
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Yes.

553
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,030
Search every detail.

554
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,960
- Behave.
- Stay still.

555
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,930
- Don't move.
- Behave.

556
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,130
- Be still.
- Stay still.

557
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,200
Hold still.

558
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,310
- Let me go.
- Behave.

559
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,430
Don't move.

560
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,030
What are you doing? Let go.

561
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,870
Stop it!

562
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,640
When did you find out?

563
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,270
When you brought Yannan's spy,

564
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,880
I was merely suspicious.

565
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,550
But when you come here,

566
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,350
I can confirm

567
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,550
Xi Changkun sent you
to kill the old soldiers.

568
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,080
Isn't that right?

569
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,160
You let Luo Qi and He Jiyao

570
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,110
put on a show for me?

571
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,750
So, your primary target is me.

572
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,670
Right.

573
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,640
I checked your background.

574
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
You have a mother at home.

575
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,830
What do you want?

576
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,880
- Stay calm.
- What do you want?

577
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,720
Stay calm.

578
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,960
My request is simple.

579
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,750
I want you to tell the king

580
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,030
the truth 12 years ago.

581
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,480
Explain it clearly.

582
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,750
If I speak,

583
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,030
Mr. Xi will kill my mother.

584
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,000
He will do it anyway.

585
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,270
I'll take you and the soldiers
to the king.

586
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,240
If they reveal the truth,

587
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,510
Xi Changkun will think you've betrayed him.

588
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,960
Given his nature,

589
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,510
how will he treat a traitor?

590
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,150
Xi Lin,

591
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,720
only you can save your mother

592
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
and yourself.

593
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,920
What if I tell the truth?

594
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,070
The Queen Mother is from the Xi Clan.

595
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,200
She will surely protect Mr. Xi.

596
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,960
- Then...
- Do you think the king

597
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,880
would really let him search?

598
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,480
Is it really for the Yannan spy?

599
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,510
Xi Changkun is deceiving the king.

600
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,790
The king no longer wants him around.

601
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,680
As long as you tell the truth,

602
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,880
the king will protect you and your mother.

603
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,880
I have no other choice.

604
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,480
Who is Xi conspiring with?

605
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,310
Mr. Xi is always cautious.

606
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,400
He personally handled Yannan affairs.

607
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I know nothing about it.

608
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,390
Your Majesty,

609
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,190
you've summoned me late at night.

610
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,670
What is the matter?

611
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,510
Lie,

612
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,800
you tell him.

613
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,710
Twelve years ago,

614
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,360
to prevent my father from becoming Wolf Lord,

615
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,190
you smuggled Yannan weapons

616
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,030
through the Uncontrollable to Cangzhou.

617
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,920
My father found out

618
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,150
and went there to investigate.

619
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,670
Unexpectedly, you noticed it

620
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,630
and you had him killed.

621
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,670
General Lie,

622
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,230
it's of great importance.

623
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,190
Don't make baseless accusations.

624
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,400
Xi Lin and the old soldiers involved

625
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,670
have all confessed.

626
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,920
You can confront them.

627
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,360
I've treated you well.

628
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,230
Why do you want me dead?

629
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,200
Your Majesty,

630
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,920
I am innocent.

631
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,630
I know nothing

632
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,480
about what General Lie said.

633
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
Your Majesty,

634
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,960
we are Xi's old soldiers.

635
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,400
Twelve years ago, unknowingly,

636
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,230
we transported some weapons for Mr. Xi.

637
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,000
We wanted to step out

638
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,710
but suffered a family massacre.

639
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,630
We luckily escaped

640
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,320
and have been living in the forest

641
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
between the Xi Clan and Xuan Clan

642
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,190
for twelve years.

643
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,510
Deputy Xi Lin and we

644
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,150
have the same totem.

645
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,510
This confirms Mr. Xi's elite troops

646
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,070
for smuggling weapons.

647
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,920
Please, Your Majesty, take note.

648
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,230
After I found out about them,

649
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,030
I hid them in the suburbs.

650
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,920
Xi Changkun searched Beixuan

651
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
just to find them

652
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,590
and silence them.

653
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
With no evidence,

654
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,590
how dare you frame me?

655
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,910
Your Majesty,

656
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,230
if he wants to bring me down,

657
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,550
he will surely bribe others.

658
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,070
Just a few words from these people

659
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,070
without solid evidence,

660
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,230
I'm afraid I cannot accept this.

661
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,910
Your Majesty,

662
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,710
why not inspect the Xi Clan's arsenal?

663
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,190
Then we will know if Mr. Xi is innocent.

664
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
The Xi Clan's arsenal

665
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,000
is inspected
by the Imperial Guards annually.

666
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,440
If I were trafficking weapons,

667
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,550
it couldn't be hidden for so long.

668
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,190
Your Majesty, please see clearly.

669
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,190
You have a point.

670
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,590
It seems not just the arsenal,

671
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
we must inspect

672
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,960
the entire Cangzhou.

673
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,710
Do not falsely accuse me.

674
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Your Majesty,

675
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,190
if Xi Changkun smuggled weapons,

676
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,840
he wouldn't have stocked them
in the arsenal

677
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,400
as it's too conspicuous.

678
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,840
Xi Lin is Mr. Xi's confidant.

679
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,070
If Xi Lin agrees to lead the Xuanyu Army

680
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,030
to uncover the hidden weapons,

681
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
I plead with Your Majesty

682
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,920
to consider his merits for redemption

683
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,880
and spare his life.

684
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,590
All right. Do it your way.

685
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,200
Xi Lin,

686
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,550
are you willing?

687
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,920
I am willing.

688
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,800
Protect the king!

689
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,590
Mr. Xi, what are you doing?

690
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,480
Anyone who betrays the Cangshui Army

691
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,400
must face death.

692
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,280
Xi Lin,

693
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,400
why have you betrayed me?

694
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,590
The case isn't settled,

695
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,230
yet you rush into silencing him.

696
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,030
Send out the order.

697
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,280
Dispatch a hundred Imperial Guards
with Xi Lin to Cangzhou.

698
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,070
Take my token with you.

699
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,760
Eliminate whoever

700
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,590
gets in your way.

701
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,190
It must be thoroughly investigated.

702
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,070
I demand a full explanation.

703
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,030
Tomorrow, the Five Clans
depart for Royal City.

704
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,880
In five days, the Wolf Lord's
coronation will take place.

705
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,480
During this period,

706
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,230
Mr. Xi, wait in the palace.

707
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,960
The Xi Clan's power is waning.

708
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,590
And you have close ties with the Luo Clan.

709
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,150
The Su Clan is insignificant.

710
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,190
It's only a matter of time
before they submit.

711
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,000
Only the Sun Clan remains.

712
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,800
Since Sun Ba's death,

713
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,400
the Sun Clan has no leader.

714
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,590
Chaos is inevitable.

715
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,760
I've thought about it.

716
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,760
If you marry Sun Zhaomin

717
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,210
and take over the Sun Clan,

718
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,650
that would be the safest path.

719
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,910
Your Majesty,

720
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,840
I see Zhaomin as my sister.

721
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,190
Besides, Zhaomin is qualified

722
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,360
to lead the clan.

723
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,700
Her performance at the event
was witnessed by all.

724
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Why won't you give her a chance?

725
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm talking about military power.

726
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,030
Don't start on love affairs.

727
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,320
I know

728
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,000
your heart longs for Jun Qiluo.

729
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,400
But don't forget

730
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
that she is from Yannan.

731
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,190
No matter what,

732
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
she can never be your main wife.

733
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,190
After marrying Sun Zhaomin,

734
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,400
you can still take Jun Qiluo as a concubine.

735
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,360
I cannot comply.
