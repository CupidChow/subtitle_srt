The wedding is canceled?

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,310
Jun Qiluo jumped off the cliff and died?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Deputy Luo sent a message earlier,

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
saying that the Wolf Lord chased Miss Jun

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
all the way to Desperation Cliff.

22
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,950
He watched helplessly as Miss Jun

23
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,200
jumped into the abyss.

24
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,950
The Wolf Lord planned to jump too,

25
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,870
but He Jiyao knocked him out just in time.

26
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,920
He is now resting in his mansion.

27
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,150
Jun Qiluo...

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,120
She did go to die.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,120
I issue a royal edict.

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,960
Postpone the wedding
of the Wolf Lord and the Princess

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
and choose a new date.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Physician,

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,680
why hasn't he woken up yet?

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,430
Don't worry, Deputy.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,120
The Wolf Lord fainted

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,750
from being overwhelmed and exhausted.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,430
He just needs a few hours
of rest to recover.

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,710
What happened?

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Didn't the General go to see Qiluo?

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Where is she?

42
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,910
Miss Jun jumped off Desperation Cliff.

43
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,360
What did you say?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
How could that be?

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,870
Today was supposed to be her wedding.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,470
Young Master hadn't had the chance
to tell Miss Jun his plan,

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
and Miss Jun...

48
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,470
It's all my fault.

49
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,120
I should have told Qiluo earlier.

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,050
Princess, you've been waiting

51
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,030
for a whole night.

52
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,470
Go back and have some rest.

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,870
We'll look after him.

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,560
Princess, let's go.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
He Jiyao,

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,080
there was a fire at Meixiang Manor.

57
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,310
Miss Jun was such a smart lady.

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,800
Could it be something she planned?

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Did anyone suspicious

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,840
show up at the mansion today?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,910
Could it be her?

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,710
Stay with Young Master.

63
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,040
I didn't expect Lie to be so obsessed

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,070
with that Yannan merchant woman.

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,510
Now that she chose to jump off the cliff,

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
I suppose

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,190
Lie won't easily agree

68
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,360
to marry the Princess.

69
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,430
If he strongly refuses,

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,390
King, you should plan ahead.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,240
He's the Wolf Lord of Beixuan,

72
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,870
so he should understand
how vital his marriage

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
is to Beixuan.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,750
I can't believe he left everyone
behind on his wedding day

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,950
to seek Jun Qiluo.

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,350
Your Majesty,

77
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,240
Princess insists on going
to see the Wolf Lord.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,190
Please go check on her.

79
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,860
(Qinghua Palace)

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,720
No, Princess.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,070
You can't go out, Princess.

82
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,360
The King and the Queen Mother are here!

83
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,060
(Qinghua Palace)

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,950
Greetings, Your Majesty.
Greetings, Queen Mother.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800
What are you doing?

86
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,000
Qingkou, where are you going?

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Mother,

88
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm going to see Lie.

89
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,000
It's too late.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,310
Lie should be resting by now.

91
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,310
Can you wait until tomorrow?

92
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
But you promised me

93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
to help me find Qingming.

94
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,000
Now there's no news of him at all.

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,190
I should have known

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
you wouldn't help me.

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,310
The only one who wouldn't lie to me

98
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,750
is Lie.

99
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,270
He's just a slave.

100
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,870
If you want one, I will...

101
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,830
He's not a slave.

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,390
He's the one I like.

103
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,590
Nonsense!

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
You're the Princess of Beixuan.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
How can you like a Yannan slave?

106
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
Just stay here.

107
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Don't go anywhere.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Qingkou...

109
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
- Qingkou!
- Don't!

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,680
If you don't help me,

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
I'll do it myself.

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,390
If you won't let me out,

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I'll die right here!

114
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,590
Enough!

115
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,630
When are you going to stop doing this?

116
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,070
Lie has lost his mind

117
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,910
over a Yannan woman.

118
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,310
And now, you want to lose your mind

119
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,160
over a Yannan slave?

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
Jun Qiluo is dead.

121
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,510
Qingming will never come back!

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,760
He probably has already
returned to Yannan.

123
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,390
Even if you die here today,

124
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,070
he won't come back!

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
What did you say?

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Jun Qiluo is dead?

127
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,830
Pull yourself together.

128
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,920
You and that Yannan slave

129
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,680
are never meant to be together.

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,510
Stay in your palace

131
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,360
and don't go anywhere.

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,120
Otherwise, I'll hunt
that Yannan slave down

133
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,360
to the ends of the earth and kill him.

134
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
Jun Qiluo is dead.

135
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,510
Qingming will never come back.

136
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,920
Qingming will never come back...

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,870
What kind of spell

138
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,560
did that Yannan slave cast on her

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,720
to make her so obsessed?

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Listen up.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Increase the guards
around Qinghua Palace.

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,270
Don't let the Princess leave.

143
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
If anything goes wrong,

144
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
you'll be punished.

Where is Qiluo?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,190
I've sent people

153
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,070
to Desperation Cliff to seek her.

154
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
The cliff is so steep,

155
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,680
and there's no path down.

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,840
He Jiyao has led soldiers

157
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
to find the one who let her escape.

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,510

I'll suffer eternal damnation.

I know you like red beans.

196
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,010
This longing jade necklace is made from

197
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,790
Beixuan's finest black jade
and Yannan red beans.

198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,910
It suits you perfectly.

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,440
Where did you find
these Yannan red beans?

200
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,080
In Central Town,
there's nothing I can't get.

(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

207
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,560
Dongyin?

208
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,990
Young Master,

209
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,510
I found the person

210
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,720
who let Miss Jun go.

211
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Yesterday, Dongyin
went to Meixiang Manor.

212
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,910
I suspect

213
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,670
she set the fire and let Miss Jun go.

214
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
So I sent people to search
the entire city overnight

215
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,480
and finally found her
at the gate of the Royal City.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,510
Did you plan it with Qiluo?

217
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,270
My patience is limited.

218
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Are you going to confess,

219
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,320
or do you need some torture?

220
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,350
Yes,

221
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,750
it was me who let her go.

222
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,960
She's shown me great kindness.

223
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,750
She wanted to leave Beixuan and you,

224
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,630
and I'd like to help her.

225
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,870
You can kill me

226
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,960
or do whatever you want.

227
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,670
So,

228
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,440
this was all planned, wasn't it?

229
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,150
She planned to jump off the cliff, right?

230
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,550
She's still alive.

231
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,240
Where did you take her?

232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,440
Where is she?

233
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,630
What do you mean, General?

234
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
Did she

235
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,630
jump off the cliff?

236
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,150
Isn't this part of your plan?

237
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,030
You know something, right?

238
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,320
Can you tell me?

239
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,390
Please tell me.

240
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,910
Tell me!

241
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,120
After I took her to the city gate,

242
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,750
we got separated.

243
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,200
I thought she just wanted to leave

244
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Xuan Mansion and you.

245
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,080
If I'd known she was going to jump,

246
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,630
I wouldn't have let her go.

247
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,510
I really wouldn't have let her go.

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
By the way, General.

249
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
Before she left,

250
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,550
she gave me a letter.

251
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,440
I was going to put it in your room

252
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
once she was safe.

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,790
Release Dongyin

254
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,510
and cancel her arrest order.

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's part ways here

256
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,000
and never see each other again.

257
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,030
Jun Qiluo,

258
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,790
you're so cruel.

259
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
You gave Dongyin a chance to live

260
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,120
but left me

261
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,480
with nothing, just separation

262
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,720
and no hope of meeting again.

263
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Let Dongyin go,

264
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,360
or how will I face her on the road

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
to the underworld?

266
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,470
Dongyin,

267
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
please go.

268
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,510
Young Master,

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,550
Princess Zhaomin came here this morning.

270
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,750
She said Miss Jun
treated her like a sister.

271
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,960
Even if Miss Jun is dead,

272
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,550
she'll never agree to the marriage.

273
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,750
She went to the King
to annul it,

274
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,270
and asked you to go to the Palace.

275
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,390
Greetings, Your Majesty.

276
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,510
Why aren't you staying at your manor?

277
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
What are you doing here?

278
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,320
Your Majesty,

279
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
General and I

280
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,240
haven't had the wedding ceremony.

281
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,630
Does this marriage still count?

282
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,720
Can't you understand my decree?

283
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,720
I said you'd get married
on another date.

284
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Your Majesty,

285
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,360
you mismatched us from the start.

286
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,630
General and I didn't marry as scheduled,

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
which shows he had no intention of it.

288
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,630
So why do you keep...

289
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,510
Insisting on it?

290
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,270
Are you questioning me?

291
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,670
No, Your Majesty.

292
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,750
Just follow my orders.

293
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
As for Lie,

294
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,150
I will persuade him myself.

295
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,670
The Wolf Lord is here!

296
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,510
Greetings, King.

297
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,670
How dare you come here?

298
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,000
On your wedding day,
you ran off and left the bride behind.

299
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,880
Do you know how long all the guests

300
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,960
waited for you?

301
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,750
The royal family has lost face
because of you.

302
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,790
Now, I'd like to hear your reasons.

303
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,920
Whatever you say, King.

304
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,070
But I can't marry Zhaomin.

305
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,200
Are you really determined

306
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,000
to defy me for the sake of
a Yannan woman?

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,270
I came here today

308
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,200
knowing I wouldn't leave unscathed.

309
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,200
Do you know the responsibility

310
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,110
your identity carries to Beixuan?

311
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,350
Are you going to throw all of that away

312
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,510
just for a woman?

313
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,510
More importantly, she is dead!

314
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,510
As long as I remember her,
she isn't truly dead.

315
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,920
I've never opposed your decree,

316
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,070
but this time, I won't back down.

317
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,200
I beg you to grant my request.

318
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,310
That's because Jun Qiluo was stubborn.

319
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,270
If she had agreed

320
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,000
to serve Beixuan,

321
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,480
she wouldn't have met
such a tragic fate.

322
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,640
King, may I ask you,

323
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,790
Jun Qiluo, a native of Yannan,

324
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,480
swore loyalty to Yannan with her death.

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,830
What's wrong with that?

326
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,510
If I were captured today,

327
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,610
with no way out,

328
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,750
I would also do the same way

329
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,400
to prove my loyalty to Beixuan.

330
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,270
- You...
- Your Majesty,

331
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,590
there's no affection between General and I

332
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,110
and yesterday,

333
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,110
I saw how deeply

334
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,720
General loves Qiluo.

335
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,110
Moreover, Qiluo has done

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,070
Liangzhou a great favor.

337
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,720
How could I repay
her kindness

338
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,260
with betrayal, taking away her lover?

339
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,270
Now, everyone in Beixuan knows

340
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,880
that General Lie deeply loves Qiluo.

341
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,830
If I marry him anyway,

342
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,440
I would become

343
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
a laughingstock for life.

344
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,960
Your Majesty,

345
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,000
I have my pride.

346
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,480
I cannot marry a man
whom my friend loves.

347
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,790
Please grant me this wish.

348
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,270
In this life, I have only one wife,

349
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,680
and that is Jun Qiluo.

350
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,440
Please grant me this wish.

351
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,510
King, I understand your concerns,

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,640
but Mr. Sun had groomed Princess Zhaomin

353
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
to be the next Sun Leader.

354
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,590
Though she's a woman,
she has extraordinary courage.

355
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,750
She will carry on Mr. Sun's legacy,

356
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,750
protect the Sun Clan,
and remain loyal to Beixuan.

357
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,350
General is right.

358
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
I understand why you
want me to marry General,

359
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,240
but I will prove my worth to you,
Your Majesty.

360
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,790
Today, I swear in my late father's name

361
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,830
to be loyal to Beixuan and to you.

362
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,550
I'll give you the Sun Clan Seal
as a sign of my determination.

363
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,140
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

364
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Since Miss Jun left,

365
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,350
you've gone nowhere

366
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,030
and only stays at Meixiang Manor.

367
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,350
He hasn't eaten in days and hasn't dealt with

368
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,400
clan matters.

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,550
Bandits are rampant
in Uncontrollable

370
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
and have already crossed
Beixuan's border.

371
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,750
The locals are suffering.

372
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,790
I don't know how to report this

373
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,270
to the Young Master.

374
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,720
(Gaze up to the Mountain's Brow)

375
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,560
Young Master,

376
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,150
time for lunch.

377
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,110
Young Master,

378
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm coming in now.

379
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,960
Young Master, please don't
do anything foolish.

380
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,910
He Jiyao!

381
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,340
(Tiger Stockade)

382
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Luo Qi, report to the King for me.

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
As the Wolf Lord,

384
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,440
I'll do my best

385
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,350
to protect the people at borders.

386
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,350
How can he fight

387
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,590
with such severe injuries?

388
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
Is he out of his mind?

♪I will silently wait♪

406
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
Physician, how is she?

407
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,400
She is fine.

408
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,830
Luckily, when she fell into the sea,

409
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,440
your ship arrived just in time

410
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,400
to save her
and the child she's carrying.

411
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,110
What did you say?

412
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,510
She is pregnant?

413
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,910
Of course.

414
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,640
She's been pregnant for over a month.

415
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,270
Just a few more days of rest,
and she'll be fine.

416
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,830
I'll take my leave now.

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,840
This way, please.

418
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,400
Young Master, you're awake.

419
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,960
Want some porridge?

420
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Young Master,

421
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,150
feel better now?

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,590
Why do you call me Young Master?

423
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,880
I've done this for over ten years.

424
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,400
In Beixuan, I had to call you My Lady.

425
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,000
Time to revert to the old way.

426
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
As long as we get back to Yannan,

427
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
everything will be back on track.

428
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,590
A few months ago,

429
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Jun Feifan died in the Uncontrollable.

430
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,350
Now, in front of you is Jun Qiluo,

431
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,750
the eldest daughter of the Jun family.

432
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,000
From now on, you should
address me as My Lady.

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,840
No!

434
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,510
You risked your life to save time

435
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,640
by taking the water route back to Yannan.

436
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Wasn't it all to get things
back on track?

437
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,920
We're already on our way back to Yannan.

438
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
How can you appear as a woman?

439
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,350
Is it because...

440
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,790
Because that man

441
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,830
got you pregnant?

442
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,040
No.

443
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,590
From the moment I decided
to return to Yannan,

444
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,550
I chose not to be Jun Feifan anymore.

445
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
What Jun Feifan could do,

446
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,270
Jun Qiluo can do just as well.

447
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,400
What the Jun family lost,

448
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,480
I will reclaim step by step

449
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,550
as Jun Qiluo.

450
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,070
But what about the child you're carrying?

451
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,440
The King and the Juns won't accept it.

452
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,000
And Jun Yujue still controls

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,030
the Jun family assets.

454
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,790
If you return as a woman,

455
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,440
how will you compete with him?

456
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,070
The Jun family's first branch
has lost control of the family.

457
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,310
Even if I return as Jun Feifan,

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,400
it wouldn't make any difference.

459
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,110
But the child is innocent.

460
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,480
I don't want my child
to be born with hatred.

461
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,760
Qimin.

462
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,750
Please help me keep this secret.

463
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,790
Don't let anyone know

464
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,480
who the child's father is.

465
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,200
This is something

466
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
I have to deal with myself.

467
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,160
When I was in Xuan Mansion, I learned

468
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,790
the King suspected me
and confiscated my family's assets.

469
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,590
But looking back,

470
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,310
it doesn't make sense for him
to make such an absurd decision.

471
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,920
The King is paranoid.

472
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,640
He wouldn't act

473
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,790
without confirmation.

474
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,350
If the Jun assets had been confiscated,

475
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,960
it would mean my treason charge
had be confirmed,

476
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,920
and an arrest order would
have been issued in all three cities.

477
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,680
But up until now,

478
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,070
there's been no move to capture me.

479
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,830
So, I think

480
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,480
the King still needs Baigong's heir.

481
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,480
Maybe he leaked the news

482
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,480
to lure me back to Yannan quickly.

483
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,080
Black iron crystals have been
transported to Yannan.

484
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
When we get to Yannan,

485
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,000
everything will be fine.

486
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,420
(Jun Mansion)

487
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,960
I'll go see the King first.

488
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,400
You go to the back gate
for the black iron crystals

489
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,590
and send a message to Uncle Ling,

490
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,590
asking him to come back.

491
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Yes.

492
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,920
I will restore the former glory
of the Jun family.

493
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,160
You're finally back.

494
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm from Yannan,

495
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,030
so naturally,

496
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,830
I'm back home now.

497
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,110
Did you find the black iron crystals?

498
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,640
I've transported them to Yannan.

499
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,240
I heard you're helping
the Xuan Clan in Beixuan

500
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,070
compete for the Wolf Lord's position.

501
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Is that true?

502
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,270
Yes, I admit it.

503
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,070
Because the black iron crystals

504
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,640
were found
in the Xuan territory

505
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,440
and then transferred to the Xi Clan.

506
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I infiltrated both
the Xuan and Xi clans,

507
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,850
pretending to help them
get the position,

508
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,000
but in fact, I was just after the mine.

509
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,280
Your Majesty,

510
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,310
I have no intention of betraying Yannan.

511
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,110
I hope you understand.

512
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,110
Now, the Wolf Lord of Beixuan
has taken office.

513
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,030
Time is not on your side.

514
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,870
Yes,

515
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,480
I will do my utmost to protect Yannan.

516
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Get up.

517
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,030
Are you going to present yourself
as a woman again?

518
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,270
Whether I'm Jun Feifan or Jun Qiluo,

519
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,550
as long as I can make weapons for Yannan,

520
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,550
it's the same to you, Your Majesty.

521
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,590
However,

522
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,680
because I didn't return on time,

523
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,030
my family was executed for treason.

524
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,110
It's all my fault.

525
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,160
This time, I'd risk my life

526
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,350
to return to Yannan.

527
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,400
One reason is to prove

528
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,880
my loyalty to Yannan,

529
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,910
and the other

530
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,070
is to settle my family's funeral matters.

531
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,270
Please grant me this.

532
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,590
This method of forcing you
to come back worked,

533
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,110
just as I expected.

534
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,750
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

535
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,070
Jun Qiluo,

536
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,160
you should know

537
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,400
that if you stay in Beixuan,

538
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,640
it will be a huge threat to Yannan.

539
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,070
You hold value for us in Yannan,

540
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,920
and I wish to avoid any rift with you.

541
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Actually, I never truly
executed the Jun family members.

542
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,550
It was just a smokescreen.

543
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,790
(Just as I expected.)

544
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,720
I know

545
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,350
your family means everything to you.

546
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Consider this your ultimatum.

547
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,750
If you still refuse to come back,

548
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,830
I'm afraid your family will have to pay

549
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,880
for your recklessness.

550
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Luckily, you came to your senses in time.

551
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,110
Once you've improved the crossbow
with black iron crystal,

552
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,790
I'll immediately release your family.

553
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

554
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,030
I will do my best.

555
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,920
- Feifan.
- Feifan.

556
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,270
Xiukun. Jiangjuan.

557
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,350
Father. Father.

558
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Father!

559
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,480
- Qiluo...
- Your legs...

560
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,350
Qiluo,

561
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
you're back.

562
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm fine.

563
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,070
Don't worry about me.

564
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,390
Father,

565
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,750
it's my fault.

566
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,110
It's all my fault.

567
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,590
The King didn't
give you a hard time, did he?

568
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,190
No.

569
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,480
Feifan, when did you come back?

570
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,440
They said you betrayed Yannan.

571
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,000
I will never believe that.

572
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,550
Yes, Feifan.

573
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
What exactly happened during this time?

574
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,510
Did you have a tough time?

575
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,310
Why are you dressed in women's clothes?

576
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,640
Don't worry.

577
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,350
I'll get you out as soon as I can.

578
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,200
Master! Young Master!

579
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,630
Master!

580
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,520
Look at him.

581
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
Teach him a lesson.

582
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,830
Jun... Jun...

583
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,830
What is it?

584
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,350
Get your breath back.

585
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,310
Don't rush.

586
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,270
You know what?
You didn't succeed for a reason.

587
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,720
The main gate
of the first branch is open.

588
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,270
Someone saw Shao Qimin,
Jun Feifan's guard,

589
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,880
coming back with a girl.

590
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,640
A girl?

591
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
Shao Qimin is back

592
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,640
with a girl?

593
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,920
Yes.

594
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,230
Could it be that Jun Feifan...

595
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,270
Father, calm down, remember?

596
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,000
There's no Jun Feifan in the world.

597
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,750
Is she human or a ghost?

598
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,350
I can tell at a glance.

599
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,310
Yujue, don't go by yourself!

600
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,630
Who is back home?

601
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,150
Well...

602
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,190
Isn't you, Jun Qiluo, Miss Jun,

603
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,320
always in Qian City?

604
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,960
Have you recovered, back to being a woman?

605
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,280
Shao Qimin, listen up.

606
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,360
If you were a real man,

607
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,670
put down your sword!

608
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,030
How dare you!

609
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,880
Yujue, you have my back.

610
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,720
A man?

611
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm a real man.

612
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,230
You investigated me?

613
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,320
Looks like you two not only

614
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,110
want to take the first branch's property,

615
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
but also schemed to overthrow Jun Feifan

616
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,550
and end my life.

617
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,840
Don't slander me here.

618
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,160
Your identity has been exposed.

619
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,960
Go find your nanny.

620
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,710
What do you want with us?

621
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
Jun Yujue,

622
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,480
I'm really worried about you.

623
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
It's one thing to lose a man before,

624
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,150
but if you can't even beat a woman,

625
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,480
how will you survive in the Royal Capital?

626
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,710
That's rude.

627
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,870
Qiluo,

628
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,880
now you've come back,

629
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,670
determined to replace Jun Feifan

630
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,360
and go against
the Jun family's ancestral rules?

631
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,870
Uncle,

632
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,150
let me give you some advice.

633
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,480
You're getting on in years.

634
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,920
Stop covering for your son

635
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,670
- and following him to mess around.
- You...

636
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,710
If you ruin your reputation at your age,

637
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,190
how will you face the spirits
of the Jun ancestors?

638
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,400
Do you still think you're Jun Feifan?

639
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,880
A woman running the family business?

640
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,480
That's never been heard of before.

641
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,480
And never been seen.

642
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,510
So,

643
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,480
are you planning to use your glib tongue

644
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,380
to etch your name
into the Jun's hall of shame?

645
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,630
- And you've deceived us for so many years.
- Exactly.

646
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,320
You should've faced retribution by now.

647
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,670
Exactly!

648
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,440
I'll face my own retribution I deserve.

649
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,710
But Uncle, Jun Yujue,

650
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,800
don't forget,

651
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll make you pay

652
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,710
for how you bullied my father
and took my shop.

653
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,550
Qimin,

654
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,400
don't let them back into the mansion.

655
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,760
- What?
- Qimin!

656
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,480
- How dare you!
- Don't touch me!

657
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Are you showing off here?

658
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,870
Chancellor,

659
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,830
what can I do for you?

660
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,320
Do you know why Jun Yujue came here?

661
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,440
I don't know.

662
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,150
He said he saw Jun Qiluo return

663
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,230
to the Jun Mansion today with her guard!

664
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,760
That's impossible!

665
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,480
How could the King of Beixuan
have let her return?

666
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,320
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

667
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,630
Didn't you say Xuan Xu
threw her in Heavenly Prison,

668
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,070
and she couldn't come back alive?

669
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
Chancellor, calm down.

670
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,360
I'll go kill her now.

671
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,200
Hold on.

672
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,070
If she doesn't overturn the case,

673
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,880
keeping her alive won't hurt.

674
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll show you how to deal with her.

for saving him back then.

What's so strange? Let's go.

707
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,070
That's impossible.

708
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,480
Young Master, a message from the Palace.

709
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,630
The King summons you.

710
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Okay.

711
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,220
(Report by Yu Ming, General Guide)

712
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,150

Could you please

714
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,470
let me go?

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,390

Qiluo!

Your Majesty, the Wolf Lord
seeks an audience.

722
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,550
Let him in.

723
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,160
Xu.

724
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,760
You've been the Wolf Lord

725
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,190
for over a month.

726
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,630
Some things need to be taken care of.

727
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,280
Now, I need to attack Yannan.

728
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,320
As the Wolf Lord,
you must take responsibility.

729
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,110
Clearly, there are peaceful solutions.

730
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,280
Why do you insist on war?

731
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,630
Peaceful solutions?

732
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,900
Your so-called peaceful solutions
is time-consuming and exhausting.

733
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,070
A battle can solve it swiftly.

734
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,510
Why waste so much effort?

735
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,630
Moreover, Baigong's heir is gone,

736
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,230
and Yannan has lost its helper.

737
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,030
If we don't attack now,

738
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,800
when will we?

739
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,230
But war burdens the people.

740
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,590
Whether it's Beixuan or Yannan,

741
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,360
the people are innocent.

742
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,440
In the end,

743
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,360
you're opposing me because of Jun Qiluo.

744
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,590
No, it's for Beixuan's
people and soldiers.

745
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,670
You are chosen as the Wolf Lord

746
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,630
to unite the Five Clans

747
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,110
and attack Yannan.

748
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,880
Now that you hold military power,

749
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,590
you're telling me
you can't lead the battle?

750
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,630
A month ago,

751
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,480
you received the seals
of the Luo, Xi, and Sun clans.

752
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,630
A few days ago, Su Yande
presented the Su Clan Seal.

753
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,090
If you want Xuan Clan Seal now,

754
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,480
I'll give it to you right now.

755
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,920
Now that you've gathered all the
military power of the Five Clans

756
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,230
and achieved their unification,

757
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,070
you can negotiate with the people,

758
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,280
set up trading posts,
and develop the economy.

759
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,150
If I propose setting up
trading posts...

760
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,590
I'd first eliminate bandits
in the Uncontrollable.

761
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,880
Then send envoys

762
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,880
to negotiate with Yannan and Xixiang.

763
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,110
Do you know how much effort

764
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,320
and profit it'll cost

765
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,550
to convince the two Kings?

766
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,320
Zhao Guang, that sly fox...

767
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,360
How much will he exploit us

768
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,360
to settle this?

769
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,550
A single war could solve this.

770
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,360
Why do we have to waste time
on this meaningless task?

771
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
No matter what,

772
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,690
the development and rivalry
between two regions

773
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,110
cannot come at the cost
of the people's lives.

774
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,070
Enough!

775
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,320
Nothing more to say.

776
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,960
I've made up my mind.

777
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,960
You have no choice

778
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,240
but to fight.

779
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
What do you mean?

780
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,590
Since you insist on attacking Yannan,

781
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,960
I'd like to relinquish this tally
and Wolf Lord position.

782
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,030
Please appoint someone else.

783
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,630
- You...
- As I've said,

784
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,400
I won't let the people
of the two regions

785
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,070
suffer because of me.

786
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,880
If you insist on war,

787
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,670
this is my only way to keep my word.

788
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,150
Your Majesty, please don't get angry.

789
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,150
He's gotten too bold

790
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,000
and keeps defying me.

791
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,110
Does he think I won't cut off his head?

792
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,910
Alright then.

793
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,150
He won't fight,

794
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,190
but there are others who will!

795
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,880
Give the Tiger Tally to the Su Clan

796
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,150
and order Su Yande to lead the army
and attack Yannan!
