(Auspicious Yang)
Uncle,

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,990
I heard Feifan is missing.

19
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,500
Is this news true?

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,550
Chengliu,

21
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,340
Feifan is the manager of our shops.

22
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,270
Without him,

23
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,750
who will manage the business?

24
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,550
- Yes, indeed.
- He's right.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,540
Everyone,

26
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,910
Feifan's disappearance is true.

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,030
He is really missing!

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,470
In that case, what should we do?

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,500
Alright, everyone.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,300
But this doesn't mean Feifan is dead.

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,580
Please stay calm.

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,620
I've sent people to search for him.

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,110
We should have news soon.

34
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,620
We'll be settling the accounts soon.

35
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,350
But Feifan is missing.

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,740
What should we do now?

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,740
- Indeed.
- What should we do?

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,740
Everyone.

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,990
In my opinion,

40
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,180
we might as well elect
an interim manager

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,140
to handle the business for now.

42
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,420
What do you think?

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,510
Chengsong!

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,020
You just heard
about Feifan's disappearance.

45
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,390
Instead of caring about his safety,

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,510
you're in a hurry to replace him.

47
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,230
Chengliu,

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,700
you've got me wrong.

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,420
Our family

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,670
can't only care about personal gain.

51
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,230
We must be responsible
to these shop owners.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,540
Moreover,

53
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,460
I worry

54
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,740
that decades of our family legacy

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,140
could be ruined in an instant.

56
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,300
Father is right.

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,790
Uncle,

58
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,790
you knew Feifan went missing.

59
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,020
Then why keep it from us?

60
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,420
He's right.

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,180
Everyone,

62
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,230
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

63
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,620
But currently,

64
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,580
I don't have real information
about that.

65
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,460
The Grand Chancellor
has also sent people to help search.

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,460
I believe Feifan will come home safely.

67
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,070
Alright.

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,940
(Brocade Embroidery)

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,350
Candied hawthorns!

70
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,860
Little trinkets!

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,900
You can go back now.

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,740
Thanks for your time.

73
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,580
See you.

74
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,620
- Bye.
- See you.

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,390
I thought you could secure
the manager this time.

76
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,230
I didn't expect your uncle would

77
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,420
sabotage us with the Grand Chancellor.

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,580
Bah!

79
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,790
It seems making Jun Feifan disappear

80
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,790
isn't enough.

81
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,390
Uncle shouldn't stay in Royal City.

82
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,070
Before the Spring Festivals,

83
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,180
Jun Feifan always
went to Qian City to audit.

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,230
Now that he's missing,

85
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,670
Uncle will definitely go in his place.

86
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,230
With his departure,

87
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,380
the entire Jun family

88
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,150
will be in our hands.

89
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,430
Yujue,

90
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,030
given the situation this year,

91
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,470
how can your Uncle leave Royal City?

92
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,710
I reckon he'll send an accountant

93
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,940
to Qian City for auditing.

94
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,190
Father,

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,230
rest assured.

96
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,500
I have a way to make him go there.

97
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,420
- General.
- Did you apply the medicine?

98
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,230
Yes, I did.

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,990
But I might have a scar.

100
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,150
I was wounded

101
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,820
for saving your life.

102
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm almost disfigured.

103
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,550
General, shouldn't you compensate me?

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,740
What do you want?

105
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,380
I want you to escort me to Xixiang.

106
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,740
Though my young master isn't there,

107
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,500
I've promised him to go there.

108
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,420
Who could have foreseen
these mishaps on the way?

109
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Given the circumstances,

110
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,230
why not return directly to Yannan?

111
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,590
For years, Young Master

112
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,910
has been searching
for fragrant stones in Yannan.

113
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,940
Besides trading, my trip to Xixiang

114
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,180
is to help find these for Young Master.

115
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,300
The Beixuan Mine is richer than Xixiang.

116
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,790
Why aren't you going to Beixuan?

117
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,420
I did hear Auntie Sun mention

118
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,710
that Beixuan also has
golden fragrant jade ore.

119
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,860
But the Juns haven't started to trade
with Beixuan,

120
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,910
and I'm unfamiliar with Beixuan.

121
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,500
What if something happens

122
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,620
after I go there?

123
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,150
Mr. Feifan may lose more than he gains.

124
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,420
So, the fragrance on you

125
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,300
comes from this fragrant stone.

126
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,740
What's so great about Jun Feifan

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,550
that makes you care for him?

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
(Jun Mansion)

129
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,940
Little trinkets!

130
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
Where are you going?

131
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,110
What did you promise me?

132
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,500
The road to Xixiang

133
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,380
is extremely dangerous.

134
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,620
Even Feifan used to tread carefully.

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,860
What can you do if you go there alone?

136
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,910
But Feifan is missing now.

137
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,180
I can't just sit back.

138
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,990
The Grand Chancellor
has sent someone to find her.

139
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,150
The Armed Escort I hired
has also set out.

140
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,860
You should stay home
and wait for the news.

141
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,870
Father,

142
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,000
the business conference is approaching.

143
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,990
You saw what happened early
this morning.

144
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,420
Upon hearing the news,

145
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,260
Uncle came to question us at dawn.

146
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,740
If Feifan truly cannot return,

147
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,110
won't that benefit them?

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,180
Besides, if Feifan can disguise
as a man and go,

149
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,550
why can't I?

150
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,670
Feifan has traveled extensively
for years.

151
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,990
She has a wealth of experience.

152
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,350
You've never been far from home.

153
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,740
How can you compare to her?

154
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,430
General,

155
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,790
I've already saved your life once.

156
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm not asking for too much.

157
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,590
Can't you agree to it?

158
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,710
Since you already know

159
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,090
the golden fragrant jade mine
is in Beixuan,

160
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,300
why not let me take you there?

161
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,990
The Juns trade closely with Xixiang

162
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,550
to purchase golden fragrant jade
at the lowest price.

163
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,110
As for Beixuan,

164
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,470
I heard from Auntie Sun

165
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,470
that the fragrant jade in Beixuan
is top quality.

166
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm concerned about the purchase price.

167
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,710
I can't decide this for Mr. Feifan.

168
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,740
You really don't take any losses.

169
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,550
I promise you

170
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,150
the same purchase price

171
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,940
as Xixiang offers.

172
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,470
Thank you for your offer.

173
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,260
It's not difficult
to take you to Beixuan.

174
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,460
But...

175
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,620
I don't keep idle people around me.

176
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
Alright.

177
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,500
It seems you're not the type
to take losses either.

178
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,310
So, what are your terms?

179
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,430
I just learned it from you.

180
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,860
The Jun silk is world-renowned.

181
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,860
You've been with Jun Feifan
for a long time.

182
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,380
I'm sure your weaving skills are solid.

183
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,860
I've been learning business from him.

184
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,270
Of course,

185
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,310
I have learned weaving skills too.

186
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,020
If you don't mind,

187
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,430
I can teach your people

188
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,830
some weaving techniques.

189
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,910
How about it?

190
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,540
What are you doing?

191
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
This is how we pledge an alliance.

192
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,310
Give it back.

193
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,660
You're not going to Beixuan?

194
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,230
(The Token mustn't be
in his possession.)

195
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,020
This is the Xuan treasure
from my father,

196
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,110
symbolizing authority.

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,280
Give it back.

198
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,030
Didn't you want a token
for the alliance?

199
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,330
Exchanges signify a true pact.

200
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,140
The Token is
Mr. Feifan's affection for me.

201
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,070
You return it first.

202
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,260
- You first.
- You first.

203
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,990
- Will you return it or not?
- Will you?

204
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,190
Fine!

205
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,900
Do not lose mine.

206
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,990
Don't you dare lose mine.

207
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,940
(Late Mother, Li Rouran. R.I.P.)

208
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,320
I've known you for many years.

209
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,500
Only you

210
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,500
never distanced yourself
because of my mother's status.

211
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,500
You even remember her memorial day.

212
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,310
People think I'm a legitimate son.

213
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,880
Actually, my father wanted me to inherit

214
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,070
his Leader position,

215
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,110
so he gave me to his wife.

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,590
However, my mother, as a Xixiang woman,

217
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,260
could never enter
the Luo Ancestral Hall.

218
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,860
I can only use
the excuse of worshiping god

219
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,860
to return here and see her.

220
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,380
Yao City is at the border
between Xixiang and Beixuan.

221
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,260
Burying your mother here

222
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,500
has fulfilled her wish
to return to her homeland.

223
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,710
This time, it's my mother's blessing

224
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,930
that you offered her incense.

225
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,990
It's my blessing.

226
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,110
She's blessing us from heaven.

227
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,470
If it weren't for your annual visits,

228
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,620
I might have perished in the flames.

229
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,310
We share a life-saving bond.

230
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,380
No need to be so formal.

231
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,070
Nanny Zhang.

232
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,470
You rarely come here.

233
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,380
Please try these Xixiang pastries

234
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,230
and help me persuade him

235
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,230
to fulfill Madam's wish.

236
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,070
As for the lady you brought here

237
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,470
in men's attire,

238
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,470
I think she'll be a fitting wife.

239
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,470
Her age matches him.

240
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,830
And she's pretty.

241
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
My young master

242
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,110
seems oblivious in this regard.

243
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,590
Please help persuade him.

244
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,430
Nanny.

245
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,020
Go prepare dinner.

246
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,950
How about we have some

247
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,350
mare cheese and hot pot today?

248
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,310
See?

249
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,540
You always stop me
from talking about marriage.

250
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,350
You're at a marriageable age.

251
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,830
It's time to get married.

252
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,430
Don't you agree, General?

253
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
Nanny Zhang is right.

254
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,310
You've passed the age of 20.

255
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,860
You should have married by now.

256
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,710
Exactly.

257
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,500
Even the General agrees.

258
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll leave you to chat.

259
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,990
I have to go for dinner.

260
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,900
It seems

261
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,240
that you can't get over that lady.

262
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,670
You mentioned before.

263
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,500
She's already married to someone else.

264
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,310
It's time to let go.

265
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,740
The person you can't forget

266
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,990
must be an extraordinary woman.

267
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,430
Li Fanyin,

268
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,110
you belong to me.

269
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,070
She is...

270
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,710
She is indeed special.

271
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,780
(Luo Residence)

272
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,860
It's Mrs. Sun's birthday in five days.

273
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,500
Only Xi Mo leads the team this time.

274
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,830
I presume Xi Changkun is

275
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,620
already on his way to Sun Clan.

276
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,540
The Sun Clan always remains neutral.

277
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,860
The Danyang Army of Sun Clan is strong.

278
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,470
If Xi Changkun wins them over,

279
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,110
it would cause trouble.

280
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,140
Xi Clan

281
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,620
is no match for Xuan Clan.

282
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,860
Sun Ba knows whom to ally with.

283
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,410
Have you forgotten?

284
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,260
Ayuli, Mrs. Sun,

285
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,710
is Xi Changkun's cousin.

286
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,650
If only we could ally
with them by marriage.

287
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,990
A son-in-law is like half a son.

288
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,540
That should make us closer to Sun Clan.

289
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,150
Young Master,

290
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,350
I heard Princess Sun Zhaomin
of Liangzhou

291
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,140
is in her prime and unmarried.

292
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,540
You're also in your prime

293
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,430
and still unmarried.

294
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,020
It's like a match...

295
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,830
If you dare talk nonsense again,

296
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,470
I'll send you to Mount Wo to mine.

297
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,270
Enough.

298
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,220
Get ready

299
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,250
for the trip to Liangzhou tomorrow.

300
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,990
My Lord, a secret message
from Royal City.

301
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,150
What happened?

302
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,990
Princess Qingkou left a letter
and ran away.

303
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,410
The King and Queen Mother

304
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,780
ordered us to find her asap.

305
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,110
Time is running out.

306
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,190
We must set off tomorrow

307
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,260
for Sun Clan in Liangzhou.

308
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,470
How can we find her?

309
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,470
Let's find Qingkou first.

310
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,540
- Young Master...
- She matters more.

311
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,500
Let's do it this way:

312
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,030
He Jiyao,

313
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,830
you lead troops to find the Princess.

314
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,620
Lie and I go to Liangzhou.

315
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,340
Okay.

316
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,140
I did this to save you.

317
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,660
This medicine heals wounds.

318
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,260
Lie won a great victory.

319
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,230
What gift should I give him?

320
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,860
What do you think?

321
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,900
The style you chose is nice.

322
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,260
But the fabric isn't good.

323
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,020
I should make it with kesi.

324
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,860
You know about kesi?

325
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,740
The Juns never sell kesi to outsiders.

326
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,070
I've only heard about it.

327
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,740
It turns out that you're not mute.

328
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,360
I thought you couldn't speak.

329
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,990
I was planning to return you tomorrow.

330
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,190
Do you have kesi?

331
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,020
No, I've just heard about it.

332
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
You don't look like a native
of the Uncontrollable.

333
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,660
What brings you here?

334
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,070
Didn't expect you to be a clever slave.

335
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,430
But I heard if a slave is too clever,

336
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,990
he might kill his master.

337
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,140
What about you?

338
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,150
Would you kill me?

339
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,920
Miss, here's the hot water you want.

340
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,380
Leave it to me.

341
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,230
I wonder

342
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,670
why Lie vanished
with someone from Yannan

343
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,430
and when I can find him.

344
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,630
You said your brother

345
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,500
has disappeared with a Yannan person.

346
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,300
Are you here to find your brother?

347
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,820
My brother is a great hero of Beixuan.

348
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,710
The bandit attack in the Uncontrollable

349
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,060
was quelled by him recently.

350
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,630
He is the Leader?

351
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,750
Of course.

352
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,390
He's the God of War of Beixuan.

353
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,190
It seems you have a deep connection.

354
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,540
So, you are a noble lady of Beixuan.

355
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,230
I am the Princess of Beixuan,

356
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,540
the King's sister.

357
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,100
Naturally, I'm the noblest one.

358
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,430
(If what she says is true,)

359
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,580
(I can use her as leverage)

360
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,540
(to save Young Master.)

361
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,340
Do you have a way to find your brother?

362
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,260
I don't even know where he is.

363
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
Without me,

364
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,360
he simply couldn't take care of himself.

365
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,870
He even ended up missing.

366
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,910
I don't even know where to start.

367
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,190
Perhaps your brother

368
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,230
has returned to the barracks.

369
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,100
Why don't we go check there?

370
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,230
Yes, you're right.

371
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,260
I've been out for so long.

372
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,320
Maybe Luo Qi and Jiyao

373
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,170
have found him.

374
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,990
If only I had traveled with He Jiyao.

375
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,260
It's all his fault
for not letting me follow.

376
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,630
Even if they haven't found Lie,

377
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,910
it's better to travel with them.

378
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,540
(I don't know when I can escape.)

379
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,100
(But I can try
to find black iron crystal.)

380
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,510
(If we can forge)

381
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,430
(economic ties with clans in Beixuan,)

382
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,300
(the Jun business will be unstoppable.)

383
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,710
You seem preoccupied.

384
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,390
When did you get here?

385
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,670
Why were you so stealthy?

386
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,630
You were deep in thought.

387
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,710
What's on your mind?

388
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,780
Yao City is fraught with danger.

389
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,990
The road to Liangzhou won't be peaceful.

390
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,390
So you're worried about my safety?

391
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,020
I thought you were missing Jun Feifan.

392
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,430
He is wise and brave.

393
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,910
No need for me to worry about him.

394
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,430
But you, General.

395
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,870
You have

396
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,390
tons of enemies who want you dead.

397
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,260
I better think of how to protect myself.

398
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,910
What? You regret traveling with me?

399
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,710
I have no choice left.

400
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,020
I believe you'll find a solution.

401
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,910
That's true indeed.

402
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,300
No need to worry

403
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,710
about Xi Clan's tricks.

404
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,540
Just roll with the punches.

405
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,910
General, don't jest.

406
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,870
It isn't your style.

407
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,780
You think ahead
and prepare for the worst.

408
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,300
When I went to find Mr. Luo Zhizhou,

409
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,910
he was already prepared.

410
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,150
With or without me,

411
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,630
he would go for the rescue.

412
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,020
But you still

413
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,430
harbor doubts about me,

414
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,950
using yourself as bait to test me.

415
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,980
You were late
by half a cup of tea's time.

416
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,010
You must be weighing the pros and cons.

417
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,020
You're actually not that sincere.

418
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,990
But I still came to the rescue.

419
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,990
You have a kind heart.

420
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,950
I am well aware of that.

421
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,190
When do we set off?

422
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,780
Why are you in such haste?

423
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,540
Opportunities cannot be missed.

424
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,960
If I can find the golden fragrant jade,

425
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,200
Mr. Feifan will be delighted.

426
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,260
Of course, I'm in a rush.

427
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,150
In that case,

428
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,260
let's set out early tomorrow.

429
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,670
So, you've planned the time.

430
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,540
Why claim it's because of me?

431
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,870
Between you and me,

432
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,990
no need to draw such a clear line.

433
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,870
We'd better make it clear.

434
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,150
Otherwise, our business won't last long.

435
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
It's getting late.

436
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,740
You should rest early.

437
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,750
I won't see you off.

438
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,300
(Xuan Lie is meticulous.)

439
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,100
(I was forced to reveal my intentions.)

440
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,950
(He may find out my true identity soon.)

441
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,020
(I must plan ahead.)

442
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,580
(Liangzhou)

443
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,710
They're only vegetables.

444
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,990
Alright.

445
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,620
Let's go.

446
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,510
Thank you, officer.

447
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Move along.

448
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,510
You.

449
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,940
Move.

450
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,140
All of you will get it.

451
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,820
No pushing. Stay in line.

452
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,730
Thank you.

453
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,060
Take it slow. Here you are.

454
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,190
You're so kind, thank you.

455
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,140
Thank you.

456
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,700
(Sun Zhaomin, Princess of Sun)
Everyone, line up, no pushing.

457
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,680
Everyone will get food.

458
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,790
Thank you.

459
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,500
Do I make myself clear?

460
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,340
You know what to do?

461
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

462
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,180
Take it slow.

463
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,260
Line up. Everyone will get food.

464
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,470
Out of the way.

465
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,310
It's your turn.

466
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
What's going on here?

467
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,820
- How dare you.
- What's wrong?

468
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,100
Don't fight.

469
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,990
Hit him!

470
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,990
Get lost!

471
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,870
Stop fighting. Stop!

472
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,990
Let's talk this out. Stop.

473
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,630
Alright, stop.

474
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,860
I'll get you!

475
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,790
Stop fighting.

476
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,430
Let's go. Go.

477
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,340
Thank you, sir, for your help.

478
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,710
You're so handsome.

479
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,870
May I have your name?

480
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,500
You can call me Qi Luo.

481
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,990
Mr. Qi.

482
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,820
Miss, can you stand up?

483
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,900
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,060
Zhaomin, are you alright?

485
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,900
I'm okay.

486
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,830
Thank you.

487
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,830
Mr. Sun.

488
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,070
General.

489
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,140
(Sun Ba, Sun Leader)
Thank you

490
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,990
and this gentleman
for saving my daughter.

491
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,950
I was unaware of your arrival.

492
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,630
Apologies for not welcoming you sooner.

493
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,870
You're being too polite.

494
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,540
We have come here

495
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,980
to celebrate Mrs. Sun's birthday.

496
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,900
(Ayuli, Sun Ba's wife)

497
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,630
You might not know yet

498
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,300
that this year's birthday banquet

499
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,580
has been canceled.

500
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,990
Liangzhou is vast
but has scarce resources.

501
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,140
Now it's hit by famine.

502
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,340
The people have no means to live,

503
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,630
and the entire Liangzhou is in chaos.

504
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,950
My wife and I

505
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,870
are in no mood
to celebrate the birthday.

506
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,300
You really cherish your people.

507
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,710
Zhizhou and I
would like to ease your burdens.

508
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,060
Mr. Sun is my cousin-in-law.

509
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,300
Liangzhou's matters are my concerns too.

510
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,620
No need for you both to worry.

511
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,230
How about this?

512
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,300
Though the birthday banquet is canceled,

513
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,820
since you've already arrived
in Liangzhou,

514
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,260
why not stay at my mansion
for a few days?

515
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,410
Allow me to extend my hospitality

516
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,710
and express my gratitude.

517
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

518
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,860
(Sun Mansion)

519
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,260
(Respect Ancestors)

520
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Liangzhou has vast sandy lands

521
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,560
and lacks water.

522
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,190
The Water Token from General Lie

523
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,540
is truly a blessing
for the Liangzhou people.

524
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,670
Let me toast General Lie once more.

525
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,430
It's my honor to assist you.

526
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,910
Though Beixuan Five Clans
are independent,

527
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,590
His Majesty wants us
to cooperate and elect the Wolf Lord.

528
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,300
Since Lie and I are here,

529
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,630
we'll do our utmost to aid you

530
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,190
in resolving the famine here.

531
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,910
I appreciate

532
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,340
your goodwill.

533
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,670
It's not easy to help the refugees.

534
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,020
Mr. Xi, what ideas do you have?

535
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,260
This concerns Beixuan's affairs.

536
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,300
It may not be suitable
to discuss before outsiders.

537
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,740
This gentleman doesn't seem
a Beixuan noble.

538
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,430
I wonder what relation he has

539
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,670
with the General.

540
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,540
Mr. Qi is my savior.

541
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,500
No need to worry.

542
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,390
So your surname is Qi.

543
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,390
Thank you for helping my daughter.

544
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,500
Let me toast you again

545
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,150
to express our gratitude.

546
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,020
My pleasure, Madam.

547
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,630
Is this your first visit to Liangzhou?

548
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,190
Their conversation is quite dull.

549
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,060
Shall I take you for a walk?

550
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,990
Mr. Qi,

551
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,430
how about a friendly contest?

552
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,910
I'm not a good fighter.

553
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,150
This spear is good.

554
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,470
It feels quite heavy.

555
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,710
Of course.

556
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,820
I commissioned this
to a master craftsman.

557
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,170
In Liangzhou,

558
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,780
it's the heaviest.

559
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,190
Why did you do that?

560
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,990
My parents only have one daughter.

561
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,120
Since childhood, people always said

562
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,500
I can't even lift a spear,

563
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,670
so how can I protect
the Liangzhou people?

564
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,470
Mother even fell ill with worry,

565
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,190
thinking of finding me
a husband in Five Clans.

566
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,150
So, since I started
practicing martial arts,

567
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,950
I've always wielded the heaviest spear

568
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,020
to prove I'm no less than any man.

569
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,190
Without marriage,

570
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,630
I can still protect Liangzhou.

571
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,070
Chengliu,

572
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,540
you only have three daughters.

573
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,260
In the future, the Juns' estate

574
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,910
will still fall to Yujue.

575
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
How about this?

576
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,950
Let Yujue learn from you now.

577
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,780
He can soon help you support the family.

578
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,380
Chengliu...

579
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,190
Father, I can help you too.

580
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,790
Good girl.

581
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,340
You can stay out of this.

582
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,740
As a girl,

583
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,780
your priority is to learn needlework

584
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,990
and to marry a man when you grow up.

585
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,470
There are always biases against women.

586
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,910
Both of you are remarkable women.

587
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,150
Don't let others' words affect you.

588
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
When traveling,
I disguise myself as a man.

589
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,060
I hope you don't mind.

590
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,710
In fact, at the city gate,

591
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,020
I already knew you were a woman.

592
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,680
Protecting Liangzhou is a hard job.

593
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,430
Are you ready for it?

594
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,510
Of course.

595
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,230
As long as I can protect Liangzhou,

596
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm willing to do anything.

597
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,630
A Clan Leader

598
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,060
needs to fight on the battlefield

599
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,470
and lead the people
to a prosperous life.

600
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,780
If you're worthy of this noble duty,

601
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,820
I can speak favorably to the King

602
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,060
to let you inherit as a Young Master

603
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,230
the position of Sun Leader.

604
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,580
Really?

605
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,820
Don't you think I can't be the Leader

606
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,910
because I'm a woman?

607
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,710
Talent knows no gender.

608
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,870
As long as you can be a good Leader,

609
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,150
nothing else matters.

610
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,780
Thank you for your kind words.

611
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,340
How do you handle things?

612
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,990
Xuan Lie still got here safe and sound

613
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,190
even at the cost
of half of the Cangshui Army.

614
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,520
Father,

615
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,540
it's all because of the woman
beside Xuan Lie.

616
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,710
She's cunning and deceitful.

617
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,710
She ruined our plans.

618
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,710
Woman?

619
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,910
Mr. Qi whom Xuan Lie brought here

620
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,500
is the woman
who rang the bell to save Xuan Lie.

621
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,300
I should've exposed her publicly.

622
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,260
Stupid!

623
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,260
If you expose her publicly,

624
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,740
wouldn't that reveal
you're after Xuan Lie?

625
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,060
You're blaming a woman

626
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,500
for your incapability.

627
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,710
- I...
- Forget it.

628
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,470
Since Xuan Lie is here,

629
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,990
he'll surely seek Sun Ba's support.

630
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,540
Luckily, we acted first.

631
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,990
Pay more attention to Sun Zhaomin.

632
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,150
She's Sun Ba's beloved daughter.

633
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,340
If you could win her over,

634
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,540
the victory is ours.

635
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,180
Got it, Father.

636
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,470
At the lunch just now,

637
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,060
Sun Ba hesitated
to discuss Liangzhou with us.

638
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,870
Perhaps he's decided
to support Xi Changkun.

639
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,100
Not necessarily.

640
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,740
Sun Ba has always been neutral

641
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,800
and stays out of the Wolf Lord Election.

642
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,150
Since the Election's coming,

643
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,430
he must haven't made up his mind.

644
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,390
Otherwise, he wouldn't have hosted us.

645
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,470
You've seldom interacted with Sun Ba,

646
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,630
and Xi Changkun is his cousin-in-law.

647
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,100
Your odds may not be great.

648
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,780
But with my support,

649
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,390
you could challenge them.

650
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,710
On this trip to Liangzhou,

651
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,670
I must gain Mr. Sun's support.

652
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,260
When my parents helped the late King,

653
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,870
they were killed
by weapons made by Baigong.

654
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,780
I don't believe
that it had nothing to do

655
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,710
with Beixuan Five Clans.

656
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,270
Lie,

657
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,060
it's been 12 years since then.

658
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,470
Even the late King

659
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,470
found no evidence back then.

660
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,390
The late King and Queen Mother claimed

661
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,440
it was an accident to maintain peace

662
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,950
among the Five Clans

663
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,910
and stopped investigations.

664
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,390
Now the King rules diligently.

665
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,670
He said if I could be the Wolf Lord,

666
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,740
he'd allow me to reopen the case.

667
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,710
So in this Wolf Lord Election,

668
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,990
I must succeed.
Failure is not an option.

669
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,950
Xi Changkun
brought food supplies to help.

670
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,390
They acted before us.

671
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,260
Meanwhile, Sun Ba remains wary of us.

672
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,580
Gaining his trust

673
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,580
won't be so easy.

674
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,740
Food only resolves a temporary concern.

675
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,710
That won't solve the root.

676
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,150
What's your plan?

677
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,910
You said Nanny Zhang
prepared the Princess

678
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,630
a sachet from Yannan.

679
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,030
Yes.

680
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,390
I forgot to give it to her.

681
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,420
I'll do it now.

682
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,190
No rush. I have an idea.

683
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,530
We'll go together tomorrow.

684
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,470
Zhaomin,

685
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,700
I've been looking for you.

686
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,870
It turns out you're here.

687
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,470
I know you love various weapons.

688
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,990
I found something special for you.

689
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,430
- Take a look
- No need.

690
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,250
This wristguard

691
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,230
was hard to get.

692
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,020
It can shoot five arrows at once.

693
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,470
Zhaomin,

694
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,100
we are destined to be family.

695
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,260
Just accept it.

696
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,230
We're not family.

697
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,500
Your parents want
to find you a good husband.

698
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,820
You are a remarkable woman.

699
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,640
Among Beixuan Five Clans,

700
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
besides me,

701
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,800
who else is a match for you?

702
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,870
My husband

703
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,260
must surpass me in martial arts.

704
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,470
If you can defeat me,

705
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,500
I'll give you a chance.

706
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,780
Choose any weapon you like here.

707
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,870
With such skills, you want to marry me?

708
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,430
Keep the wristguard for your safety.

709
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,710
Chancellor Song said
Jun Feifan was missing.

710
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,260
Why wasn't this reported immediately?

711
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,470
Your Majesty,

712
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,190
I never intended to keep it from you.

713
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,390
It's just that the news was uncertain.

714
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,950
I've sent an Armed Escort to find him.

715
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,820
The Grand Chancellor also sent masters

716
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,340
to search for Feifan.

717
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,630
Any news yet?

718
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,230
Not yet.

719
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,100
It's quite a mystery.

720
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,790
Neither Jun Feifan
nor the Captain of his escort

721
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,020
was found at the scene.

722
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,580
Do you know the reason?

723
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,640
Your Majesty,

724
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,310
the bandits are rampant.

725
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,220
Killing and looting happen often.

726
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,750
Feifan was unlucky to encounter them.

727
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,540
He must be concerned about Yannan,

728
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,790
cared about her duties,

729
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,500
and escaped to find
the black iron crystal.

730
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,020
I hope Your Majesty
won't get him wrong.

731
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,790
What if he takes the wrong path

732
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,060
while searching for the crystal?

733
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Your Majesty,

734
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,470
Feifan's been trading for years.

735
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,790
He knows

736
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,910
what's the right path.

737
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,470
Yujue,

738
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,870
stay calm.

739
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,540
Don't be so hasty.

740
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,150
By the way,

741
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,220
how did that matter go?

742
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,630
Father,

743
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,470
rest assured.

744
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,500
I've bribed the Prefect of Qian City.

745
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,700
With tax issues as an excuse,

746
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,620
the managers there were detained.

747
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,010
Uncle is probably

748
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,700
going to handle this in a few days.

749
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Father,

750
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,790
stop reading the book. Look at me.

751
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,660
If we get the Chancellor's support,

752
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,430
wouldn't it be easier for us

753
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,830
to control the Jun business?

754
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,270
What's your plan?

755
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,500
Last time, we took the managers

756
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,470
to visit Uncle, right?

757
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,990
He used the Chancellor to suppress us.

758
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,270
With their absence,

759
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,390
why not strengthen ties
with the Chancellor?

760
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,470
But he's been closer to them
over the years.

761
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,470
If we suddenly pay him a visit,

762
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,870
is it appropriate?

763
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,900
Father,

764
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,430
I disagree with you.

765
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,500
The Chancellor values the Juns' brand,

766
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,350
not Jun Feifan himself.

767
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,350
Moreover,

768
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,220
Jun Feifan might have been dead.

769
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,140
Uncle is getting on in years.

770
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,910
The Chancellor knows whom to choose.

771
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,580
Electing a new manager for the Juns

772
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,220
is an urgent matter.
