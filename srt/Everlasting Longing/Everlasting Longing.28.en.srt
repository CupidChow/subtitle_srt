=Episode 28=

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,480
Mr. Jun,

18
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,760
I know that Yannan has a tradition
of apologizing with a whip.

19
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,310
I've wronged Qiluo

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
in the past.

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,870
If you want to punish me,

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,430
I'm willing to accept it.

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,350
But I hope you will

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,870
give me one more chance.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Since you're willing to be punished,

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
I will grant your wish today.

27
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,580
I investigated everyone
who went to the Commander's home

28
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,410
on the day the letter was delivered.

29
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,800
Aside from the vegetable vendor,

30
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,280
there was also an attendant
from the Zhengs' shop,

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,340
who went for measurements.

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,680
The Zhengs' shop?

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,080
It's the second largest shop
in the capital.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,800
But the Zhengs are merchants.

35
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,330
How could it be involved
with the Military Supply Case?

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,910
Under the pretense of measuring clothes,

37
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,870
the Zhengs told the Commander the news.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,140
They must've taken precautions

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,480
around their shop as well.

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
My Lady, don't worry.

41
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
I will act with caution.

42
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,310
Qiluo has dressed as a man
since she was young.

43
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,400
At 13, she designed weapons
for the King.

44
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,000
The Jun family's vast fortune

45
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,120
has been supported
entirely by her alone.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,750
She single-handedly handles
the weight of a thousand-ton ship.

47
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,560
She has never mentioned

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,520
the hardships to me.

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,400
But when this great wave strikes,

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,120
the burden on her shoulders
is too heavy.

51
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,870
How I wish she could be
an ordinary person,

52
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
with joy

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
and sorrow,

54
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,560
someone to rely on,

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
and someone to love.

56
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,480
I have seen the time

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
the two of you spent together.

58
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,430
You diverted
the Forbidden Troops for her,

59
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,070
putting yourself in danger.

60
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,510
She thought you had died

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
and was heartbroken.

62
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,390
My brother tried to harm me,

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,310
but Qiluo never spoke of it.

64
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,560
She only sought you for advice.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,190
When she faces peril or difficulty,

66
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,870
you always step forward,

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
coming up with plans to help her.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
Before you came to Yannan,

69
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,630
I had never seen

70
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,480
such a living, breathing Qiluo.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
Mr. Jun, rest assured.

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
No matter what happens in the future,

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
I will stay by her side

74
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,270
and be with her.

75
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,270
Get up now.

76
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,470
Get up.

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
I won't stop you two
from being together.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,160
But I have something unpleasant

79
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,800
to say now.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,950
In the future,
when facing great difficulties,

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,040
even if it's a hopeless situation,

82
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,600
you must protect Qiluo.

83
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,600
Parents who love their children

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,720
plan ahead for them.

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,310
Don't blame me.

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
You can rest assured.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,310
If that day really comes,

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
I will protect her with my life.

89
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,630
Are you trying to murder your wife?

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Stop lurking around all the time.

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,940
I no longer live in the Jun Mansion.

92
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,910
If I don't lurk around,

93
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,240
do you expect me to walk openly?

94
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,440
Because of the spy incident,

95
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
the Jun Mansion has been under watch.

96
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,600
I just don't want to hurt you.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
You're worried about me.

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
Why are you carrying the luggage?

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,270
I don't like living with Lie.

100
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,820
I want to live with you.

101
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,070
You are my husband.

102
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,660
It's only natural that I live with you.

103
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,640
You and I...

104
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,240
If you dare to chase me away,

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
I will go to the Jun Mansion every day

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
and let those watching there

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,730
take me back to take credit.

108
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,800
You know I can do this.

109
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,130
Since I arrived in Yannan,

110
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,680
I've been hiding in the Jun Mansion,

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,630
never leaving there.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,870
This is your home.

113
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,190
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

114
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,720
I should get to know this place.

115
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,000
After I help you cure the poison,

116
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,190
will you take me around?

117
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,910
Don't worry.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
I promise you.

119
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,060
I'll never test the medicine
on my body again.

120
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,030
Good.

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,040
I'm tired.

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll go rest now.

123
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
(Luo Residence)

124
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,150
Report.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,870
My Lord, the soldiers
have been gathered.

126
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,200
We will leave for Beixuan in three days.

127
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Yes.

128
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
My Lord.

129
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,750
Why are you going to Beixuan?

130
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,840
Xuan Xu broke his promise.

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,630
I must seek justice for Fanyin.

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
My Lord,

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
we no longer have many soldiers left.

134
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,600
Even if we go,
we can't avenge the Consort.

135
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,960
We might even lose our lives.

136
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
You can stay here.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,500
You don't have to go with me.

138
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
My Lord,

139
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,000
the Consort is already dead.

140
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,240
You've done so much for her.

141
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,670
You've done enough for her.

142
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,480
The Consort and I have worked hard
for you to have a new life.

143
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,960
It's not worth it for you

144
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
to go die for her.

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,280
My Lord,

146
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,200
can't you let go of the past

147
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,390
and start a new life?

148
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,910
I have lived my life for Fanyin.

149
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,840
I will not allow her to die quietly.

150
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,630
I will seek justice for her.

151
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
My Lord,

152
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,770
I've also lived my life

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
for you.

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
Now, we've reached
a peace agreement with Yannan.

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,870
Zhao Guang has agreed

156
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,720
to build the trading post together.

157
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,120
Next,

158
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll send people to the Uncontrollable
to suppress the bandits

159
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,720
as a sign of sincerity.

160
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,550
How wise of you.

161
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,080
But now that Lie is not here,

162
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,510
I can only rely on Zhaomin.

163
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,000
Spread my order:

164
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,600
Sun Zhaomin shall go suppress
the bandits in the Uncontrollable

165
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,430
and move forward
with establishing the trading post.

166
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,350
Yes.

167
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,870
Your Majesty.

168
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,600
The Wolf Lord's Cavalry Supervisor,
De Lihan, seeks an audience.

169
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,110
Let him in.

170
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,120
De Lihan may come in.

171
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,970
Greetings, Your Majesty.

172
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,510
Did Lie send you?

173
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
Your Majesty,

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,600
the young master asked me
to deliver this letter to you.

175
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,270
He's been gone for so long.

176
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm surprised he has a letter for me.

177
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Xu,

178
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,960
the peace agreement between Beixuan
and Yannan is progressing smoothly.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,720
The peace treaty has been signed,

180
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,870
and the envoy will depart
for Beixuan soon.

181
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Qingkou is doing well,

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,360
but her heart is with Shao Qimin.

183
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,510
She is unwilling to return
to Beixuan alone.

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
I'll protect Qingkou.

185
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,360
I also want the Queen Mother and you
to accept Shao Qimin

186
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,000
and respect Qingkou's decision.

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I beg for your forgiveness.

188
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,000
I've decided to live
the rest of my life in Yannan

189
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,870
to stay by Jun Qiluo's side

190
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,200
and investigate Xi Changkun's
Yannan accomplices

191
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,690
to honor my parents' spirits
in the afterlife.

192
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,840
De Lihan will return
the Wolf Lord Seal for me.

193
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
From Lie.

194
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,880
Your Majesty, please calm down.

195
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,550
Lie is getting more and more reckless.

196
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,840
He even wants to stay in Yannan
to be with Jun Qiluo.

197
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,300
Your Majesty, please calm down.

198
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,120
The Wolf Lord is concerned
about Beixuan.

199
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,000
It must be a temporary decision.

200
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,670
He has neglected both me and Beixuan.

201
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
Alright.

202
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,270
Then I'll fulfill his wish.

203
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,870
Even without Lie,

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,000
I can still strengthen Beixuan.

205
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
Spread my order:

206
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,600
Send a letter to the envoy.

207
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,940
He has to bring Qingkou back

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,390
even if he has to tie her up.

209
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,750
As for Shao Qimin,

210
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,230
if she wants to bring him back,

211
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,320
then let her.

212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,440
Yes.

213
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,060
(Jun Mansion)

214
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Qiluo,

215
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,390
according to our ancestral rules,

216
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,840
women can't manage the household.

217
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,270
Hand over the family seal now.

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,750
I was just about to discuss this
with the elders.

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,000
During this time, you've seen

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
what Jun Yujue has done.

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,750
I only took back the family seal

222
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,120
for the future development
of the family.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,790
I'd like to ask all of you:

224
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,320
Is there anyone else more suitable

225
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,630
than me to take the seal?

226
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,270
We've discussed this.

227
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,960
We can select a young man
from another branch.

228
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,270
Chengliu can adopt him

229
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,960
and change his name.

230
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,670
When he grows up,

231
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,120
he can inherit the family business.

232
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,200
But for now, it'll be hard for Chengliu.

233
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Are you saying

234
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,390
you want my father to train
another Jun Feifan?

235
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,720
What's wrong with that?

236
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,390
Jun Feifan is a rare business talent,

237
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
a once-in-a-thousand-year genius.

238
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,790
The elders only need to speak,

239
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,240
while my father has to spend
another decade training him.

240
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,790
If he can train another Jun Feifan,

241
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,630
that's fine.

242
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,720
But what if he can't?

243
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,670
Do you want to gamble with our future?

244
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,710
Enough.

245
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,300
This doesn't need further discussion.

246
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,360
I disagree.

247
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Chengliu,

248
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,790
do you want to go
against the family rules?

249
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
Yes.

250
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,480
Today, I'll abolish this ancestral rule.

251
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,390
You...

252
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,290
Lie,

253
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,390
you came at the right time.

254
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,670
Come and have lunch with us.

255
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
Qingkou,

256
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,940
why did you sneak back again?

257
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,360
Qingming and I are just
like you and Jun Qiluo.

258
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,200
You traveled all the way
to Yannan for Jun Qiluo,

259
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,250
and I want to stay
with Qingming forever.

260
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,030
Moreover, we are married,

261
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,850
so it's more justified than you two.

262
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,420
She can be unreasonable,

263
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
but can you?

264
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,000
The King has written to ask Qingkou
to return many times.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,940
What do you plan to do?

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,960
Shao Qimin, are you even a man?

267
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,630
The Princess has done so much for you,

268
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,310
- yet you're still so quiet.
- Enough.

269
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,710
In a few days,

270
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll have He Jiyao escort you
and Qingkou back.

271
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,510
Really, Qingming?

272
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,440
If you return to Beixuan with me,

273
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,550
I'll protect you
for the rest of your life.

274
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,240
You know my identity.

275
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,300
It's impossible for me
to leave Yannan privately.

276
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,550
You serve the King of Yannan,

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,390
but it's not your own wish.

278
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,750
If you're willing,

279
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,150
I will report to Xu,

280
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,490
and he'll send someone to resolve this.

281
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
Don't worry.

282
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,440
I will protect Qiluo.

283
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
You and Qingkou

284
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,510
can live the life you wish from now on.

285
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
Work hard,

286
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,000
be honest,

287
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,000
don't chase fame and wealth,

288
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,870
pursue long-term peace,

289
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,600
and forbid women
from running the family.

290
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,750
Since the elders are here,

291
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,670
you can all bear witness.

292
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I, Jun Chengliu,

293
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,720
will abolish the last one
of the family ancestral rules today.

294
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
This...

295
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
- Uncle Ling.
- Master.

296
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,590
- Bring me the pen.
- Yes.

297
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,000
Violating the family rules

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,350
will bring disasters.

299
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,830
Violating the ancestors...

300
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,570
This...

301
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,080
(Forbid women from running the family)
It'll bring disasters.

302
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,820
You can't do this.

303
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,880
How could you do something

304
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,200
- so rebellious?
- Yes.

305
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,070
My daughters were the ones

306
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,750
who helped the family rise again.

307
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,680
When the family was in decline,

308
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,200
did any of you offer help?

309
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,680
- Well...
- Everything's better now,

310
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,400
but you want to support a young man
from another branch.

311
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
You know how capable they are

312
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,720
but refuse to admit it.

313
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,920
How absurd.

314
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,680
For the Jun family,

315
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,440
only talent matters.

316
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,590
So what if they're women?

317
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,750
Without business acumen,

318
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,440
even a man can lose

319
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,960
the family fortune.

320
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,310
I, Jun Chengliu,

321
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,640
will abolish this ancestral rule today.

322
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Qiluo,

323
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
from today on,

324
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,000
you will take charge

325
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,440
of all family businesses.

326
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,630
Yes.

327
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
Why did you sneak here again?

328
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,480
Were you noticed?

329
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,960
It seems we've never

330
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,510
watched the stars so quietly before.

331
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,480
♪We come from a time of chaos♪

332
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,980
We used to be tangled
in trivial matters.

333
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,400
Now, we can finally enjoy some peace.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
Qiluo,

335
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,640
there's something I want to give you.

336
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,790
♪When I decide to hold you in my arms♪

337
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,530
♪I bury all past matters deep inside♪

338
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Did you carve this?

339
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,080
Qiluo,

340
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,160
we've gone through many hardships,

341
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,110
almost disappearing
from each other's lives.

342
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,570
I can't imagine a life without you.

343
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,990
♪Becomes a shadow in my heart♪

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,960
We'll be

345

like this wood carving figurine,

346
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,000
forever hand in hand,
walking side by side.

347
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
Qiluo,

348
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,270
will you

349
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,110
be my wife?

350
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,980
♪To fall in my heart

351

I will never make you sad or upset.

353
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,590
I'll love you, protect you,

354
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,200
and care for our child forever.

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,070
I know your feelings,

356
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,950
but

357
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,640
you also know I care about my family.

358
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,960
I want to wait
until my father agrees to it.

359
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Qiluo, don't worry.

360
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,960
Father has already agreed.

361
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,920
Father, you...

362
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,950
Qiluo,

363
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
this boy has passed the test.

364
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,240
With him helping you hold up this sky,

365
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,270
I can rest easy.

366
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, Qiluo.

367
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,200
You should hurry and agree.

368
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,680
Or Lie will be embarrassed.

369
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,200
When did you bribe my family?

370
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,350
I didn't bribe them.

371
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,340
It's all out of sincerity.

372
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,960
You want me to marry you

373
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,070
with just a woodcarving?

374
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Miss Jun,

375
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,480
there's more.

376
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,070
Lie is really generous.

377
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,110
Dear, are you satisfied?

378
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Based on my family fortune,

379
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,270
do you think these things
can move me?

380
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,310
These are all the property deeds
I have in Beixuan.

381
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,160
I'll give them to you.

382
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,640
If I break my vow,

383
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,880
you can leave with them anytime.

♪When I decide to hold you in my arms♪

385
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840

Seeing Qiluo so happy,

395
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm really glad for her.

396
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Miss Jun is about to marry
my young master.

397
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,840
Miss Jiangjuan,

398
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,550
do you have someone you fancy?

399
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,480
I haven't met anyone yet.

400
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,880
What kind of husband do you like?

401
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,350
Maybe I can keep an eye out for you.

402
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,750
I like...

403
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,410
I like someone who is good-looking,

404
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,510
tall and imposing,

405
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,510
and someone who can protect
the family with me.

406
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,110
And the most important thing

407
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
is he must marry into my family.

408
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,830
Your sister is not restrained,

409
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,240
doing such disgraceful things,

410
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,150
but she still lectured me
about propriety.

411
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,510
She's disgraced the family.

412
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Xiukun,

413
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,030
can you

414
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,920
move out of the Jun Mansion?

415
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,070
You can tell the outsiders

416
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,920
that you despise Jun Qiluo's immorality

417
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,510
and don't want to live with her.

418
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,770
What are you thinking?

419
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,800
Qiluo,

420
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,350
these days,

421
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,960
seeing how you and Xuan Lie get along,

422
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
I can't help

423
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,680
but compare you two with Shuting and me.

424
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Ever since we got engaged,

425
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,070
he's always emphasized propriety,

426
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,240
virtuosity, and kindness,

427
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,070
so that his family reputation
is not tarnished.

428
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,510
But he's never asked me

429
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,070
what I like or want.

430
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,160
I used to think
he was focused on studying,

431
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,440
and that he was considerate toward me,

432
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,650
so he's a good husband
in everyone's eyes.

433
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,440
Marrying him might not lead
to an unhappy life,

434
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,270
but when our family faced difficulties,

435
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,200
he threatened several times
to break off the engagement.

436
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,920
I started to wonder

437
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,590
that if I'm really in danger
in the future,

438
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,960
will he stay steadfastly by my side

439
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,480
like Xuan Lie did?

440
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,110
I've acted as Jun Feifan for many years,

441
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,310
so I'm destined not to be a proper lady.

442
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,000
If I hadn't met Xuan Lie,

443
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,530
I might've decided to live alone
for the rest of my life.

444
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
Xiukun,

445
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,590
you've always been obedient.

446
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,310
You've always done

447
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,370
whatever we told you to do,

448
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,160
especially since your engagement

449
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,270
to Zheng Shuting.

450
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,590
I know you've endured a lot

451
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,880
for both families' reputations,

452
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,890
but you've forgotten your own feelings.

453
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,310
I don't want you
to trap yourself this way.

454
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
You should be yourself.

455
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,440
You should often think

456
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,720
about what kind of life you want to live

457
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
and what you can do
to make yourself happier.

458
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,830
What kind of life do I want to live?

459
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,350
We must first learn to love ourselves

460
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,110
to make ourselves happy.

461
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Only then can we love others.

462
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,270
At that time, you'll realize

463
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,270
that even without Zheng Shuting,

464
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,720
you can face all difficulties
on your own.

465
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,040
By the way,

466
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,060
there's one more thing
I didn't tell you.

467
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,720
About what happened at the Office,

468
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,790
according to my investigation,

469
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,000
Jun Yujue's sample

470
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,680
came from Zheng Shuting.

471
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,950
What?

472
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,680
He did such a thing?

473
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,720
I'm sorry, Qiluo.

474
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,560
It's alright.

475
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,790
I should thank him.

476
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,000
If not for him,

477
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,300
we wouldn't have gotten
the business back so quickly.

478
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm telling you this

479
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,400
not to make you blame him

480
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,480
but to make sure

481
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,880
you clearly understand

482
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
what kind of person
you are about to marry.

483
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
Once you've thought it through,

484
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,110
whatever your decision is,

485
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,270
I will support you.

486
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,100
(Blessed by the Immortal)

487
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,680
Why do you look so troubled these days?

488
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,700
You even asked me to drink with you
during the day.

489
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,350
When you were
with Miss Jiangjuan days ago,

490
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
you weren't like this.

491
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
Jiyao,

492
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,640
if you

493
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,200
like a girl...

494
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,750
I don't have a girl I like.

495
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,590
I mean if...

496
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,510
If you like a girl,

497
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,640
but she wants a live-in husband,

498
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,000
would you agree?

499
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,920
I wouldn't.

500
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,790
I'm a Deputy General of Beixuan.

501
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,880
How can I marry into a girl's family?

502
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,480
That's right.

503
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
Besides,

504
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,110
if this gets out,

505
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
it'll become a laughingstock in Beixuan.

506
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
Exactly.

507
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,920
How could I give up

508
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,240
my beautiful grasslands for a girl?

509
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,800
That's right.

510
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,440
Our grasslands

511
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,590
are far more beautiful

512
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,690
than bricks and tiles here.

513
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,200
But I still can't let go of that girl.

514
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,680
Why are you crying?

515
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,350
Xiukun wants
to break off her engagement?

516
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,950
Father,

517
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,270
after this period of time, I understand

518
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,480
Shuting is not the right man for me.

519
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,910
Xiukun,

520
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,550
have you thought this through?

521
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,880
You're right.

522
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,000
Rather than trying to please him,

523
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,200
it's better to learn to please myself.

524
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,510
So, what are your plans afterward?

525
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Qiluo,

526
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,030
I want to open a workshop of my own,

527
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,550
so that everyone in the capital

528
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,400
can buy my needlework.

529
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,970
I agree.

530
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,110
- In the capital,
- Great.

531
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,890
no one's needlework
is better than Xiukun's.

532
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,000
If you open a workshop,

533
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,920
it'll be packed every day.

534
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,880
After thinking it over,

535
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,110
I've found out
that what I love and am best at

536
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,600
these years is embroidery.

537
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,410
When the needlework is completed,

538
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,440
it always makes me happy somehow.

539
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,480
The pieces I made in the past

540
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
were all branded with the Juns' name.

541
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,720
I don't know if the buyers

542
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,480
liked my needlework

543
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,640
or if they were just drawn

544
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,160
to our family's renowned reputation.

545
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,590
So, I want to open a workshop of my own.

546
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,510
I hope the customers

547
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,440
come for my craftsmanship.

548
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Xiukun,

549
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,350
I support whatever decision you make.

550
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,790
Tomorrow, I will go
and break off the engagement.

551
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,030
Xiukun is the best.

552
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,030
Qiluo and I will both support you.

553
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,820
(Good Times and Beautiful Scenery)

554
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,700
Good.

555
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,620
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

556
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,950
Chancellor.

557
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,400
What's the matter?

558
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,110
Chancellor,

559
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,590
Jun Qiluo's guard is investigating

560
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,070
who leaked the news of Beixuan's spy.

561
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,400
They might've traced it to the shop.

562
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,680
How do you know he's Jun Qiluo's guard?

563
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,010
The symbol of the Baigong's heir
was on his sword.

564
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,240
Others might not recognize it,

565
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,960
but my people wouldn't mistake it.

566
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,050
How could you make such a mistake?

567
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,070
You've let them catch onto us.

568
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,310
Chancellor, forgive me.

569
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,150
I never thought

570
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
he'd trace the source
of the information.

571
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,720
I...

572
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,880
I've also found out something.

573
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,950
What's that?

574
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,350
Xuan Lie didn't die.

575
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,480
He's hiding in a civilian house.

576
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
Xuan Lie isn't dead?

577
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,440
How did he survive?

578
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,630
He must die.

579
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,680
He used a fake corpse
to fool the Forbidden Troops.

580
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,110
A few days ago, he helped Jun Qiluo

581
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,200
take back Brocade Embroidery

582
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,160
and threw Jun Yujue
and his father into prison.

583
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,310
His whereabouts were exposed again.

584
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,640
We have to kill him
to avoid future trouble.

585
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,880
I'll find a way

586
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,590
to get rid of him.

587
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,400
Don't make things harder for me.

588
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,240
Get lost.

589
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,830
I made you some soup.

590
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,720
You should rest now.

591
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,030
You're not the Wolf Lord now,

592
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,640
so you want to be a cook?

593
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,170
Hey, this is my first time
making soup.

594
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,630
Be careful; it's hot.

595
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,240
Is it good?

596
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,280
Yes, it's good.

597
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,230
My Lady,

598
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,240
we found it was a servant
from the Zhengs' shop

599
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,650
who tipped off the Forbidden Troops.

600
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,570
It was Zheng Yuan,
the Chancellor's butler,

601
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,920
and the real owner of the shop.

602
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,920
Zheng Yuan?

603
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,880
It was him?

604
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,680
When I was questioning the servant,

605
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,830
I purposely showed my symbol.

606
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm sure Zheng Yuan will act tonight.

607
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,960
Let's go check his house.

608
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,180
(Zheng Residence)

609
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,720
Why is the door open?

610
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,790
Something's off. Let's go in and check.

611
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,940
(Gentle Breeze)

612
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:46,420
(Gentle Breeze)

613
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,450
Other than the deceased,

614
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,030
only you two were here?

615
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,870
Yes.

616
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,200
The deceased was already dead
when we arrived.

617
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,880
The killer must've left long ago.

618
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,190
My Lord,

619
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,440
the windows are all closed.

620
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,780
There are no signs of a struggle.

621
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,550
Preliminary investigation
suggests suicide.

622
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,590
Suicide?

623
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,350
We'll investigate further at the yamen.

624
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
Someone, take the body away.

625
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes.

626
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,870
My Lady,

627
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,000
after observing earlier,

628
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,760
I believe the spy from Yannan in Beixuan

629
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,980
was actually Zheng Yuan.

630
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,720
If it really was him,

631
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,710
this must be the right direction
for our investigation.

632
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,670
But why did he commit suicide?

633
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,020
When a person hangs themselves,

634
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,590
their head tilts down.

635
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,030
But why is his head tilted up?

636
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,670
Maybe the killer is someone else.

637
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,730
The killer strangled him first,

638
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,440
causing a break in the neck,

639
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,800
so the head didn't tilt down.

640
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,480
The body shows signs of unnatural death,

641
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,590
and there are no signs of a struggle,

642
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,490
which means it was
someone close to him who did it.

643
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,600
The investigator deals
with murder cases often.

644
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,000
How could he make such a huge mistake?

645
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,350
My Lady,

646
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,550
I'll go retrieve the body.

647
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,990
It's useless.

648
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,630
The investigator

649
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,280
asked how many people were in the room.

650
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,190
He must've been on guard against us.

651
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,630
He and Zheng Yuan are just pawns.

652
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,720
Zheng Yuan worked for the Chancellor,

653
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,480
and the investigator is an official.

654
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,190
Who can command both of them?

655
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,950
Song Wei.

656
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Song Wei holds a high position.

657
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,400
It won't be easy

658
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,840
to find evidence from him.

659
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,760
Maybe we need someone

660
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,570
who can move freely
at the Chancellor's house

661
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,760
and is willing to help Zheng Yuan

662
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,070
to help us gather evidence.

663
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,420
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

664
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,590
I saw Zheng Yuan breathe his last.

665
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,080
The body was brought
to the yamen at the Zi hour.

666
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,210
Jun Qiluo can no longer
continue the investigation.

667
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,410
Chancellor, what to do next?

668
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,360
Zheng Yuan's served me for years.

669
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,800
Now that he's dead,

670
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,110
give him a proper burial.

671
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,960
I also need some time to adjust.

672
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:38,500
(Kind and Respectful)

673
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,710
Your Majesty, you're skilled at Go.

674
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
I lost

675
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
the entire game.

676
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,280
I haven't played Go with you
for a long time.

677
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,920
It's rare that you have time today.

678
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,440
A while ago,

679
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,130
you were busy
negotiating with the envoy,

680
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,840
so you must've been working
day and night.

681
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,590
I didn't want to disturb you.

682
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,880
You're considerate.

683
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
The negotiations went very smoothly.

684
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
There was no great effort needed.

685
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,990
That's true.

686
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,150
With the Jun Manager helping you,

687
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,880
I shouldn't worry.

688
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,500
What does she have to do with this?

689
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,400
You negotiated with the envoy
on the court,

690
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,630
and privately, the Beixuan Wolf Lord
had dealings with the Juns,

691
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,550
so the negotiations
would surely go smoothly.

692
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,440
The Beixuan Wolf Lord
had dealings with the Juns?

693
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,480
When did this happen?

694
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
You didn't know?

695
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,070
I've said too much.

696
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,550
Explain it clearly.

697
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,860
(Jun Mansion)

698
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Shuting,

699
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,230
I thought you were
diligent and studious,

700
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,840
a good choice for a husband.

701
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,070
But I didn't expect

702
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,840
you'd do something so shameful to us.

703
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,320
Xiukun's been upset
because of you every day.

704
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,440
As her father, I can't just sit idly by.

705
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,030
I was foolish.

706
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,000
I shouldn't have trusted Mr. Yujue.

707
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
But I did this

708
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,480
because Miss Qiluo had been

709
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,510
wandering around with her sisters.

710
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,000
I was concerned
about Xiukun being pointed at.

711
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,420
There's a reason for my actions.

712
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,510
Mr. Jun, please understand.

713
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,630
You blame three people

714
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,630
for your mistakes,

715
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,320
but you come out unscathed.

716
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,360
Such irresponsibility makes me

717
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,000
even more reluctant
to entrust Xiukun to you.

718
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,590
I was just anxious.

719
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,150
I promise

720
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,170
I won't do anything
to harm your family again.

721
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,120
Xiukun,

722
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,590
say something.

723
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,670
Don't you know
what kind of person I am?

724
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,590
I'm just too concerned about you.

725
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,510
Zheng Shuting,

726
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
our connections have ended.

727
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,030
I'm officially notifying you today

728
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,920
that our engagement is broken.

729
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,800
From now on,
please address me as Miss Xiukun.

730
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,110
Jun Xiukun,

731
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,670
as a woman, how could you
break off the engagement?

732
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,710
If anyone should do that,
it should be my family.

733
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,150
If your family did that,

734
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,430
the marriage would be destroyed,

735
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,920
so the dowry should be returned.

736
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,480
Xiukun didn't want
to make it hard on you

737
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
because of your past,

738
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,400
but now you care about that?

739
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,440
A young woman should know her manners.

740
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,510
Shame on you!

741
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,800
- You...
- How dare you!

742
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,110
The engagement is canceled now.

743
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,440
We'll have no more ties.

744
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,920
Uncle Ling, see him off.

745
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,510
Mr. Zheng, please leave.

746
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,190
Xiukun,

747
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,280
this time, I made a mistake.

748
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,960
I will find a better husband for you.

749
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,200
Father,

750
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,480
let me handle my marriage on my own.

751
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,150
I also want to choose my own husband,

752
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,520
just like Qiluo and Jiangjuan did.

753
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,920
Jiangjuan has also found someone?

754
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,630
Well, Xiukun,

755
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,070
your shop is about to open today.

756
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,360
You must be very busy, right?

757
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,400
Let's go. I'll help you.

758
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,600
Come on.

759
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,480
Here's your tea.

760
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,400
How do we know

761
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,940
who'll help Zheng Yuan by sitting here?

762
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,790
Zheng Yuan's been in the mansion
for over a decade.

763
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,910
Even if he didn't have
any close associates,

764
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,230
he must have his servants.

765
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,920
Now, during court hours,

766
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,350
Song Wei is not at the mansion.

767
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,080
They'll take this opportunity
to pay respects to Zheng Yuan.

768
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,480
If someone truly cares about Zheng Yuan,

769
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
it'll be easy for us

770
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,190
to persuade them.

771
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,840
I've been hiding in Yannan for so long,

772
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,030
and I know the terrain here well.

773
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,280
There's only
one paper offering shop nearby.

774
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,810
They'll surely come here
to pay respects to Zheng Yuan.

775
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,840
My Lady, please have some tea.

776
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,860
It's someone from Song's mansion.

777
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,840
It seems our guess was right.

778
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,880
The Beixuan spy in those rumors

779
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,510
must be the Beixuan's Wolf Lord.

780
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,960
Jun Qiluo and Shao Qimin
have indeed betrayed me.

781
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,160
Your Majesty,

782
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
in my opinion,

783
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,630
why not summon these two traitors
to the Palace,

784
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,510
find any excuse to accuse them,

785
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,670
and sentence them to death?

786
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,440
Shao Qimin is poisoned.

787
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,130
I can stop giving him the antidotes.

788
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,360
But

789
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,710
there's still something
I need to confirm

790
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,550
about Jun Qiluo and Xuan Lie.

791
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,980
(Spirit Tablet of Zheng Yuan)

792
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,320
Jun Qiluo?

793
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,000
Why are you here?

794
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,400
Even a mere servant

795
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,920
recognized me at a glance.

796
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,800
Who in the entire capital
doesn't know who you are?

797
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,960
If you were a street vendor,

798
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,160
you'd naturally recognize me,

799
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,430
but you're just a servant
at the Chancellor's mansion,

800
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,020
living inside and never going out,

801
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,630
yet you recognized me immediately.

802
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,840
That doesn't quite make sense.

803
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,380
You work for Zheng Yuan, right?

804
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,590
Zheng Yuan's mysterious death

805
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
has made everyone stay far away
from this place,

806
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,990
but you came here
to offer incense for him.

807
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,630
He must've helped you before he died.

808
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,320
Mr. Zheng was my lifesaver.

809
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,110
Don't make me see him again.

810
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,070
Chancellor, please spare me.

811
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,960
Chancellor, please spare me.

812
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,470
Chancellor...

813
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,390
Stop.

814
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,230
From now on, you'll follow me.

815
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,320
Thank you for saving my life.

816
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,000
I know he was your enemy,

817
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,070
but if you want any info

818
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,230
from me about him,

819
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,130
you might be wasting your time.

820
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,000
Do you know how he died?

821
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,480
Zheng Yuan likely got exposed
while working for Song Wei,

822
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,230
so Song Wei had him killed

823
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,520
out of fear of being implicated.

824
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,760
Zheng Yuan saved your life.

825
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,110
You wouldn't want him
to die in vain, right?

826
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,280
So, you came to find me today

827
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,550
to help Mr. Zheng?

828
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
No.

829
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,070
We came here to help ourselves.

830
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Only you can help Zheng Yuan.
