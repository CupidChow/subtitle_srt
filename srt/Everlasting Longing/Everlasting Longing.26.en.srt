Yes.

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,460
Some merchants gathered
outside the shop,

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,020
accusing us of stealing silk

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
and saying they don't trust us.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
And...

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,000
People are talking

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,790
about my pregnancy.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,840
They don't want to do business with us.

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,430
The second branch is shameless.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,230
Qiluo, don't take their words

28
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,070
to heart.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120

With Father, Xiukun,

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,870
you, and Qimin,

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,750
I fear nothing.

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,750
If they want to cancel orders, let them.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
But if the orders are canceled,

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,430
our shop might struggle to survive.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,990
Do as I say.

37
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,310
By the way, Qiluo,

38
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,240
be careful when you go out these days.

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,680
Something's happening lately.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
I heard last night,

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,190
the guards caught two Beixuan spies.

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,310
Where were they caught?

43
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,080
At Zhang's abandoned house

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,410
on Rongchuan Lane, in the suburbs.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,310
Both were pretty good fighters.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,000
The Forbidden Troops had to set a fire

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
and burned them alive.

48
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,150
Have you seen De Lie and Luo Qi?

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,470
Not since last night.

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Qiluo.

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
You're with a child.

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,860
(Great Blessings)
Slow down.

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,430
Two Beixuan spies were
executed on the spot.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Check carefully.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,870
Look for any other clues.

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,840
There's a fire in the west.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,150
I heard the Forbidden Troops are
chasing two Beixuan spies.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,560

No way.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
- Make way.
- Move aside.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
- Get back.
- Clear the path.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680

She and the unborn child are fine.

90
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,600
She fainted due to overwhelming sadness.

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,800
I'll prescribe two doses of calming medicine.

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,680

Qimin,

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,190
what happened?

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,510
Could the two burned Beixuan spies

97
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,190
be related to Qiluo?

98
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,270
Qimin,

99
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,800
she was devastated seeing the bodies.

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,070
Who were they really?

101
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,630
The two burned Beixuan spies

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,390
were our workers, De Lie and Luo Qi.

103
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,710
What?

104
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,830
Luo Qi was a Beixuan spy?

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,000
They weren't Beixuan spies.

106
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,680
De Lie is actually Beixuan's Wolf Lord,
Xuan Lie.

107
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
He's also

108
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,070
the father of her unborn child.

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
He hurt Qiluo so badly,

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,310
making her jump off a cliff.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,510
How could he come back and face her?

112
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,190
But look how sad she was.

113
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,920
She must really love him.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Dad,

115
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,630
he must be the one
who wrote you that letter

116
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,600
and made you crippled
in the Uncontrollable.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,190
If I had known earlier,

118
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,240
I would've broken his legs,

119
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,430
avenging you and Qiluo.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,160
Xuan Lie knew Qiluo's identity.

121
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,870
Have those two in your room left?

122
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,750
They left before the Forbidden Troops came.

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,310
What Qimin said today,

124
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,120
you must not reveal a single word.

125
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,590
Rest assured, Father.

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,630
We won't.

127
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,060
(Gentle and Humble)

128
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,240
If you care about this child,

129
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
get out

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
of my sight right now.

131
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,710
My Lady,

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,790
where are you going?

133
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,960
I need to find Qingkou and He Jiyao.

134
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
They've already left.

135
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,030
Where did they go?

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
I'll take you there.

137
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
He Jiyao, let me go.

138
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,790
I must save Lie.

139
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,280
Princess,

140
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,750
I've investigated.

141
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,240
Young Master and Luo Qi were burned
by the Forbidden Troops.

142
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,550
Their bodies were taken away.

143
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,790
Impossible. Lie can't be dead.

144
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,670
- I must go now.
- Princess.

145
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,960
- Move aside.
- Princess.

146
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,030
- Step aside.
- Princess, you cannot go.

147
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,060
- Move aside!
- Princess.

148
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,870
Where is Xuan Lie?

149
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,390
This is your plan, isn't it?

150
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,470
No way.

151
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,320
You're all lying.

152
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,310
My Lady.

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,150
You're all lying to me.

154
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,390
It's you.

155
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,440
It's all because of you.

156
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,150
I'll kill you to avenge Lie.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
It's got nothing to do with her.

158
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,870
Miss Jun,

159
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,480
please take care of the princess.

160
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
I'll reclaim Young Master and Luo Qi's bodies

161
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,510
and avenge them.

162
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,870
Stop.

163
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,840
Going out right now is walking into a trap.

164
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,790
No one leaves.

165
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,080
He Jiyao, don't listen to her.

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
Go retrieve Lie's body.

167
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,510
Stop causing trouble!

168
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
Protecting you

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,150
is all I can do for him now.

170
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,710
Qimin,

171
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
take them to Jun's old residence.

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
This inn is not safe.

173
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,750
Yes.

174
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,020

175
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Miss Jun,

176
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,200
I know you haven't forgiven him,

177
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,240
but now that he's gone,

178
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,320
there are things you must know.

179
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,030
I never understood why

180
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,510
he would still try to protect you,

181
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,510
knowing you're Baigong's heir,

182
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,750
and why he would find evidence

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that proves your innocence
in Mr. Xuan Shu's case.

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,390
It wasn't until the day
you jumped off the cliff

185
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,240
that I realized

186
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,750
he valued you

187
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,510
more than his own life.

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,320
He couldn't reject the King's arrangement

189
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,400
(Goodness Brings Happiness)
for him,

190
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,480
but he had already planned

191
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,630
to have Mrs. Sun adopt you as her daughter.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,480
That would've been your wedding that day.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,240
You thought faking your death

194
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,630
would have put an end to all this,

195
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,630
making him forget you gradually.

196
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,750
But you never knew

197
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,510
what he had told the King.

198
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,030
He said you're his only wife in this life.

199
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,200
Even when he thought you were gone,

200
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,770
he insisted on building a trading post
in the Uncontrollable.

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,600
It was all because of you.

202
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,360
Young Master always kept this with him.

203
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,670
I don't know how many nights

204
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,910
I've seen him staring at it until dawn.

205
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,840
Today, he drew away the Forbidden Troops,

206
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,670
fearing that you would be implicated.

207
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,080
He had fought in countless battles,

208
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,030
fearless of blades,

209
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,150
but the one thing he fears is losing you.

210
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
So, Miss Jun,

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,790
please stop resenting him.

212
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,270
You know what?

213
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
The spies were burned so badly.

214
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,670
It's a sight too awful to bear.

215
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,960
Could it be

216
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,000
that Beixuan isn't seeking peace?

217
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,390
Or do they want to fight again?

218
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,550
A dog in peace lives better
than a man at war.

219
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,670
Hope there are no more wars.

220
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
Here.

221
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Young Master Jun,

222
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,200
I've brought you a sample
of Jun Qiluo's work,

223
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,240
helping you secure that order.

224
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,670
When do you think you can

225
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,480
take me to visit Mr. Liu?

226
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,440
No rush.

227
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,350
Look,

228
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,320
although you got me the silk gauze sample,

229
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't have the production document for it.

230
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,870
Without the document,

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
how can I produce it?

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,870
If I can't produce it,

233
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,000
how can I deliver it?

234
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,200
So, you need to help me once more.

235
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
It's too despicable.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,910
I've done it once. Not again.

237
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,200
My dear brother-in-law,

238
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,720
you and I are now

239
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,600
in the same boat.

240
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,960
If you don't help me,

241
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,720
aren't you afraid my uncle and Xiukun
will find out?

242
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,480
If they find out,

243
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,440
how do you think they'll treat you?

244
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,280
You...

245
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,150
Jun Qiluo's premarital pregnancy is exposed.

246
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,630
No one visits her shop now.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
If you help me this last time,

248
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,390
I can surely defeat Jun Qiluo.

249
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,440
Is it really the last time?

250
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,560
Yes.

251
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,990
Come on.

252
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,500
(Gentlemen)

253
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,460
(Production Document of Silk Gauze)

254
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,870
Qiluo,

255
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,680
Xiukun went to check the shop.

256
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,110
Nanny Ling made your favorite soup.

257
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
Qiluo,

258
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,920
you're expecting a child.

259
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,830
Why put yourself through such strain?

260
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,960
I heard when you were in Beixuan,

261
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,510
Xuan Lie forced you off a cliff.

262
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,750
He hurt you so deeply.

263
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,070
Why feel sorry for him?

264
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,510
He didn't force me.

265
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,960
I intentionally jumped off the cliff

266
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,350
to make him give up.

267
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,270
Had you not been forced,

268
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,240
you'd never have left that way.

269
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,830
There's too much between him and me.

270
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,510
He was always trying to find a way.

271
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,790
I just thought

272
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,960
only such a farewell

273
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
could make him give up.

274
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,680
But now I understand.

275
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,750
The greatest pain isn't separating

276
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,590
but living alone.

277
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,590
Qiluo,

278
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
there's nothing you can do.

279
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,440
I was worried about his safety.

280
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
That's why I wanted him back in Beixuan.

281
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,110
But I never

282
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,000
imagined he would truly die.

283
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,630
Qiluo.

284
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,580
(The Consort faces hardships in the Palace.)

285
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,220
(Prosperity and Longevity)
Any news from Beixuan?

286
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
Is Fanyin doing well?

287
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,030
Please rest assured.

288
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,590
The Consort is well.

289
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,910
My Lord,

290
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240
all of your estates

291
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,590
resemble the old mansion.

292
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
It's kind of dull.

293
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,830
How about we renovate them?

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,550
Fanyin likes it this way.

295
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
After a while,

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,590
the yard will be full of flowers.

297
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,720
It will be beautiful.

298
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,750
But sadly, Fanyin can't see it.

299
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,030
Why should I expect more?

300
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,560
I just want her
to be safe and sound in the Palace.

301
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,980
(The Consort faces hardships in the Palace.)

302
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,100
(Moon Palace)

303
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,670
Zhizhou.

304
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,430
Your Ladyship?

305
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,630
Your Ladyship!

306
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
Your Ladyship!

307
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,760
Your Majesty,

308
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,160
words from the Moon Palace

309
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,070
that Consort Li

310
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,800
has passed away.

311
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,940
(Respectfully, Xiao Yu)

312
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,070
Life and death are destined.

313
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,390
I have done

314
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,480
all that is right.

315
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
The Forbidden Troops suspect

316
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,480
the two Beixuan spies burned to death

317
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,110
had been hiding in the Jun Mansion.

318
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,790
What's your opinion?

319
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,920
Your Majesty,

320
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,750
I've been living with the Juns

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,550
and found nothing unusual.

322
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Recently, the peace talks
have reached an end.

323
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,590
I agreed to establish a trading post

324
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,110
in the Uncontrollable.

325
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,270
Those spies came at this time.

326
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
What is their real conspiracy?

327
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,160
I dare not speculate.

328
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,750
Last time the King of Beixuan sent a spy

329
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,400
to make Your Majesty believe

330
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,350
that Baigong's heir was serving Beixuan.

331
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,030
Could it be for the same reason this time?

332
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,790
Are you suggesting he is sowing discord again

333
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,590
to make me mistrust the Juns?

334
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
And what about you?

335
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,200
Do you trust the Jun family?

336
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,960
It's not that I trust the Juns,

337
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,590
but Jun Qiluo values her family

338
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,030
more than her life.

339
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
Harboring spies is a capital offense.

340
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,270
She has no reason to cause trouble.

341
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,000
That makes sense.

342
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,070
Investigate why the spies came.

343
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,950
As you command.

344
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
Also,

345
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,880
Jun Qiluo is pregnant before marriage.

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Why did I not

347
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,720
hear it from you?

348
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,830
Apologies, Your Majesty.

349
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,350
I'm having an audience

350
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,830
to report this matter.

351
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,310
That is a rumor.

352
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,110
Jun Qiluo is not pregnant.

353
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,110
Is that so?

354
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,070
I've been by Jun Qiluo's side.

355
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,750
Were there any signs,

356
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,880
I would've noticed.

357
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,200
It's easy to tell if that's a rumor

358
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,510
with a simple check.

359
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,350
Your Majesty,

360
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,880
Jun Qiluo is here.

361
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

362
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,550
As you were.

363
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,690
The Forbidden Troops mentioned

364
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,350
that the spies frequently appeared
at your mansion,

365
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,510
likely coming for you.

366
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Your Majesty,

367
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
no spies from Beixuan had contacted me.

368
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
Please rest assured.

369
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I would never betray your majesty.

370
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,960
Yannan is truly blessed to have you.

371
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,160
You must take good care of her.

372
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,320
I will.

373
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,830
You don't look well today.

374
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,200
Have you been working too hard?

375
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,910
Since you're here,

376
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,030
let the imperial physician
check your pulse

377
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,370
and treat you properly.

378
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

379
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,070
I caught a cold some time ago,

380
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,050
but I'm recovered now.

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,840
No.

382
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,920
Your health matters.

383
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
If anything happens to you,

384
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,270
what about my 150,000 bolts of silk?

385
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,350
Mr. Zheng,

386
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,880
you handle things so efficiently.

387
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,680
I hope everything goes well for you.

388
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,030
And that Xiukun can soon find peace.

389
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,830
Rest assured.

390
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,540
(Production Document of Silk Gauze)
With this,

391
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,640
I believe Jun Qiluo

392
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
won't cause me trouble.

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,070
You mentioned introducing me to Mr. Liu.

394
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,310
Come on, buddy.

395
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,550
Come on, buddy.

396
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,510
No need to worry at all.

397
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,590
- All right?
- Okay.

398
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,160
I'll take you to visit him these days.

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
All right?

400
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,680
Thank you so much.

401
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,720
Thank you.

402
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,040
Your Majesty,

403
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,720
Miss Jun's pulse is steady.

404
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,720
Though it shows signs of fatigue,

405
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,350
there is nothing serious.

406
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,630
That's good.

407
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,830
You may return now.

408
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,270
I shall take my leave.

409
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,400
I shall take my leave.

410
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,270
It seems Shao Qimin did not lie.

411
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Your Majesty,

412
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
he has taken poison.

413
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,030
His life is in your hands.

414
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,750
He wouldn't dare lie.

415
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,790
Don't underestimate him.

416
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,920
Delay the antidote for now this time.

417
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,400
Let him learn his lesson.

418
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
Yes.

419
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,960
Luckily, you predicted this,

420
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,000
and we were prepared.

421
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,640
The medicine hid pregnancy well.

422
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,720
Otherwise, we wouldn't have escaped.

423
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,700
Now that the rumors

424
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,070
about my pregnancy are swirling.

425
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,240
I've stayed in Beixuan for long.

426
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm afraid the King will suspect me.

427
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,510
We must prepare in advance.

428
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
My Lady,

429
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,200
we can align our statements.

430
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,270
We can say

431
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,920
Jun Yujue started the rumor to frame you.

432
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,440
But the King, to be sure,

433
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,110
will call a physician
to check my pulse.

434
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,160
Then, I won't be able to hide it.

435
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,200
If only there's a way to deceive.

436
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,270
Seems like we'll need Qingkou's help.

437
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,960
But in a few more months,

438
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,720
your belly will grow.

439
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,270
You won't hide it for long.

440
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,920
It's only been two months.

441
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,000
My belly will grow in two or three months.

442
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,070
I'll be discreet with my attire.

443
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
I'll go back now.

444
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,070
Have some rest.

445
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,830
He Jiyao, let me out.

446
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,680
Let me out!

447
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,910
Move aside!

448
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,240
Are you disobeying me?

449
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,630
If you don't let me out,

450
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,470
after we return,
I'll have the King punish you

451
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,710
and your whole family.

452
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,030
The young master ordered me to protect you.

453
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,400
I will not let you risk your life.

454
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,640
It's already late.

455
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000
Princess, please have a rest.

456
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,590
Burn the incense for me.

457
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,670
Or I can't sleep.

458
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,440
Qingming, can you take me to...

459
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,800
Qingming.

460
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,680
Qingming, what's wrong?

461
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,920
Is it the poison?

462
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,040
Where is the antidote?

463
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,430
Where is it?

464
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,160
Lie has already gone.

465
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,180
I won't let anything happen to you.

466
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,800
I can save you.

467
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,160

Now, the silk gauze

498
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,590
is already fully completed.

499
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,920
In three days, it can be delivered.

500
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,350
Moreover, I have already

501
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,830
bought out all the silk for it

502
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,960
in the Royal Capital.

503
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,510
From now on, we'll be unmatched.

504
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,270
You're smart enough

505
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,590
to prepare in advance to get the sample.

506
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Otherwise, that girl might really

507
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,230
use the silk to raise again.

508
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,640
Father,

509
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,960
no worries.

510
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,920
Even if Jun Qiluo

511
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
secures that big order,

512
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,760
so what?

513
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,360
Right now, she's living

514
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,110
with a terrible reputation.

515
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,280
In my opinion,

516
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,670
her shop will close eventually.

517
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,590
Master, Young Master.

518
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,800
Something went wrong.

519
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,910
Look at this.

520
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,710
The gauze was fine yesterday.

521
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,630
Master, Young Master.

522
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
What's going on here?

523
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,800
What exactly happened?

524
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,590
We have no idea.

525
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,150
It was fine yesterday.

526
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,590
After drying, it turned out like this.

527
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,880
In three days, we have to deliver.

528
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,880
What should we do now?

529
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,230
Did you follow

530
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,510
the document I gave you?

531
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,960
We did.

532
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
Jun Qiluo,

533
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,070
how dare you set me up?

534
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,510
Qimin.

535
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
My Lady.

536
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,880
I've been thinking.

537
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,230
Xuan Lie and Luo Qi were cautious.

538
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,110
No one should know their appearance.

539
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,400
But He Jiyao mentioned

540
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,070
the Forbidden Troops came over directly.

541
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,630
Xuan Lie revealed his identity
to distract them

542
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,880
and keep me safe.

543
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,760
Do you think someone might've known

544
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,030
Xuan Lie's identity?

545
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,800
Could it be Xi Changkun's accomplice?

546
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,150
I want to investigate for Xuan Lie.

547
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,550
Perhaps.

548
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,960
Can you find out from the Forbidden Troops

549
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,800
how they knew Xuan Lie

550
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,280
was here that day?

551
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,720
Qimin.

552
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,680
My Lady.

553
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,510
You've seemed a bit off these days.

554
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,030
Are you all right?

555
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm fine. I'll go investigate now.

556
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,880
Jun Qiluo!

557
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,620
- What do you want?
- Move!

558
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,400
- Wait up.
- Jun Qiluo!

559
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
Slow down.

560
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,230
Jun Qiluo, come out here!

561
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,960
Slow down.

562
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,590
What are you doing here?

563
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,480
Where's Jun Qiluo?

564
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Tell her to come out!

565
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,360
Right now!

566
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,550
Manager Jun,

567
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,280
why are you here instead of

568
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
at Brocade Embroidery?

569
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,590
Jun Qiluo,

570
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,190
is this your doing?

571
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,710
I don't understand.

572
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,190
You don't understand?

573
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,430
Ask her again.

574
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
Is this your doing?

575
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,320
Let me see.

576
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,190
It's not easy to make it this way.

577
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,030
I have a production document,

578
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,110
but it's incomplete.

579
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,800
If produced following that,

580
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,070
the silk gauze would look like this.

581
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,760
However, my document

582
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,110
went missing a few days ago.

583
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,670
Did you take it?

584
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,110
Jun Qiluo,

585
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,110
you set me up.

586
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,710
You wrote it wrong on purpose

587
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,230
to bait me?

588
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,110
You are only half right.

589
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,030
Before the Royal Procurement Office
selected fabrics,

590
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,590
I've already set up the trap.

591
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,920
You told me

592
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,960
to prepare ten samples of silk gauze

593
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,590
to show the fabric shops
in the Royal Capital.

594
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
But somehow,

595
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,800
I found one missing today.

596
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,800
I couldn't find it anywhere.

597
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,030
It's fine. You go on ahead.

598
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,440
After the sample went missing,

599
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,000
I suspected it was you.

600
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,760
Indeed, during the fabric selection,

601
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,230
you presented the silk gauze.

602
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,480
So I let you have the order.

603
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,320
You secured the order,

604
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,440
but could only deliver
such poor-quality goods.

605
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,760
Do you think they'll let you off?

606
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,190
Jun Qiluo,

607
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,150
I truly underestimated you.

608
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
I knew it.

609
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,070
You stole our sample,

610
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,800
causing our shop to lose business.

611
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,710
How could Qiluo let you go easily?

612
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,550
You...

613
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Jun Qiluo,

614
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,710
if we can't deliver in three days,

615
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,440
not only will we be blamed,

616
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,230
but Brocade Embroidery

617
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,630
won't survive.

618
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,510
In comparison

619
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,400
to what you've done,

620
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,000
my efforts are nothing.

621
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,800
I've prepared enough silk gauze in my shop

622
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
to help you overcome this crisis.

623
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,480
But I have one condition.

624
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,920
Exchange it for the family seal.

625
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,160
In your dreams!

626
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,880
You think you can
take Brocade Embroidery back?

627
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,190
Not in this lifetime.

628
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,070
Jun Qiluo,

629
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,320
your premarital pregnancy

630
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,960
is already disgraceful.

631
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,920
How dare you defy our family rules?

632
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,440
You're completely humiliating the Juns.

633
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,230
Get out of the Jun family...

634
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,070
Who is it?

635
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,960
Who attacked me?

636
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,280
Come out now.

637
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,150
Who did it?

638
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,280
Show yourself.

639
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,510
Yujue.

640
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,070
- Who?
- It's not even a festival.

641
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,550
Why are you saluting now?

642
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
Father, give me a hand.

643
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,280
- Who?
- Father.

644
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,440
- Qiluo.
- Father.

645
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,360
Father!

646
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,150
Have a look.

647
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,230
Flowers.

648
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,900
