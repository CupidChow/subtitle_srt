16
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,580
(The world remains unsettled.)

17
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,830
(Wars between nations rage on.)

18
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,060
(Xixiang, Beixuan, Yannan)
(There are three nations.)

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,910
(Beixuan is known for its valor
in battle,)

20
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,670
(but its Five Clans,
Xuan, Xi, Luo, Sun, and Su,)

21
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,910
(act independently,)

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,160
(embroiled in constant strife.)

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,940
(Electing a Wolf Lord is urgent.)

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,180
(With its flourishing commerce,)

25
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,900
(Yannan is barely able
to contend with Beixuan.)

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,070
(Weapons designed
by Yannan's Jun family)

27
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,020
(are key to national defense.)

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,110
(Father, rest assured.)

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,830
(I'll fulfill my duty
as Baigong's heir,)

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,900
(protecting both Yannan
and the Jun family.)

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,260
(Jun)

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,180
(Xuan Shu,
Leader of Beixuan's Xuan Clan,)

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,110
(was killed by a weapon crafted
by Baigong's heir.)

35
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,740
(His son, Xuan Lie,
investigated for years)

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,740
(and finally found out Baigong's heir)

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,700
(is Jun Feifan,
eldest son of Yannan's Jun family.)

38
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,940
=Episode 1=

39
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,380
(Jun Qiluo, eldest daughter
of the first family branch, Yannan)

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,070
Father,

41
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,650
have you found
the black iron crystal?

42
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,480
(Jun Chengliu, head of the first branch)
We've searched all over Yannan.

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,270
There's still no news.

44
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,180
Tomorrow, our trade caravan
will head to Xixiang.

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,620
I can use this chance
to search for them there.

46
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,110
I won't allow you to go.

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,020
Father.

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,110
You'll need to pass
through the Uncontrollable,

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,110
which borders Beixuan
and is full of bandits.

50
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,350
Right now, Beixuan's Five Clans
are competing for the Wolf Lord.

51
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,950
The border is in chaos.

52
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,350
I worry that if anything happens...

53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,190
Father,

54
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,310
I can defer to you
on routine escort matters.

55
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,010
But the black iron crystal is crucial
for improving the crossbow.

56
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,420
Once Beixuan elects its Wolf Lord,

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,060
their next move
will be to attack Yannan.

58
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,180
If we can't find
the black iron crystal before then

59
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,990
and solve the crossbow's
wear-and-tear issue,

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,060
I fear the King
will hold us accountable.

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,860
So, I must go and try,

62
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,350
even if it's Beixuan,

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,790
let alone Xixiang.

64
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,350
You...

65
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
Father.

66
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,300
Listen to my advice.

67
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,620
Return to your identity as a girl.

68
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,670
Stop taking such risks.

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,900
Father,

70
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,820
even if I return to being a girl,

71
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,580
I'll still need to design weapons
as Baigong's heir

72
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,810
for the King.

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,140
Our ancestral rule doesn't allow women
to lead the family.

74
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,040
Are you willing
to hand over the family legacy

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,230
to the second branch?

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,790
I guarantee that within a year,

77
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,030
Jun Yujue will squander
the family fortune,

78
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,940
which has accumulated over decades.

79
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,620
Moreover, since I was seven,
I've made this decision.

80
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,620
Unless a better heir
appears in the family,

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,230
I will remain Jun Feifan for life.

82
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,460
You caught me again.

83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,190
(Jun Jiangjuan, youngest daughter)
You always use the same tricks.

84
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,190
Try something different.

85
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,230
What do you need?

86
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,790
(Noble Characters)

87
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,820
I heard Father wants you
to return to being a girl

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,550
and marry Qimin.

89
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,390
Did you agree?

90
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,620
Just a stalling tactic.

91
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,500
I knew it. How could you agree?

92
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,620
Qimin is great,

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,230
and he follows your every word,

94
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,120
but I always feel you two
aren't the same type of people.

95
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,710
Don't you agree, Xiukun?

96
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,740
Qimin is the only outsider

97
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,500
who has earned Feifan's trust
over the years

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,660
(Jun Xiukun, second daughter)
and knows her identity.

99
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,700
I think he's the best choice.

100
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,500
Feifan has expanded the family business

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,150
to 80 shops across Yannan

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,380
and created
a joint capital management system,

103
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,590
leading Yannan's people
toward prosperity.

104
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,380
How could any ordinary man be her match?

105
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,350
If Feifan truly returns
to being a girl and getting married,

106
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,420
her match must be an exceptional man.

107
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,260
I don't need a man.

108
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,030
My greatest wish in this life

109
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,500
is to protect the family,

110
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,990
you two,

111
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,060
and Father.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,810
Tomorrow, I'll travel
to Xixiang for trade.

113
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,950
Xiukun,

114
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,060
you have the best embroidery skills
among us three.

115
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,260
Keep an eye on the embroiderers
of Gold Embroidery

116
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,150
and Brocade Embroidery.

117
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,390
Jiangjuan,

118
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,590
you're full of clever ideas.

119
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,710
While I'm away,

120
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,990
cheer up Father often,

121
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,670
and help Uncle Ling manage the shops.

122
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,500
If anything happens
at the jewelry store,

123
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,590
inform Father immediately.

124
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,590
Feifan, when will you return?

125
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,710
I'll be back
before the business conference.

126
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,870
Father,

127
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,710
while I'm gone,

128
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,650
if the second branch

129
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,820
stirs up trouble again,

130
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,990
you must punish them severely.

131
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,150
Don't be lenient or indulgent.

132
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,550
With me here, they can't do anything.

133
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,030
This journey is dangerous.

134
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,990
Be extremely careful.

135
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,710
Father, don't worry.

136
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,350
It's not my first trip to Xixiang.

137
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,260
Young Master,
all goods have been checked.

138
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,030
Father, we're leaving.

139
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,870
Alright.

140
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,060
Qimin, keep Feifan safe.

141
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,030
(Shao Qimin, guard)
Rest assured.

142
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
I'll protect the young master
with my life

143
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,860
and ensure her safe return.

144
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
- You...
- Feifan.

145
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,940
For some reason,

146
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,590
I feel uneasy today.

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,590
Take this sachet for protection.

148
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,110
Xiukun embroidered this,

149
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,180
but I sourced
the fragrant stones inside.

150
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,500
Their scent calms the mind
and steadies the nerves.

151
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,490
Where did you find
such wonderful things?

152
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,020
These could be next year's new products
for the jewelry store.

153
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,660
Feifan,

154
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,820
stop thinking about goods
and business all the time.

155
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,420
Pay more attention to your safety.

156
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,420
We're leaving now.

157
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,180
Alright, go ahead.

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,180
(The Uncontrollable, Leather City)

159
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,100
What happened?

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,860
Oh, no, it's horse plague.

161
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,710
The climate here is unstable.

162
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,350
We should leave as soon as possible.

163
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,200
Notify everyone:

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,910
Deal with all infected horses
on the spot.

165
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,660
Inspect thoroughly.
No mistake is allowed.

166
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,500
Understood.

167
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,380
Young Master,

168
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,990
I just checked.

169
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,580
Less than half of our horses remain.

170
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,150
We might not make it to Xixiang on time.

171
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,020
Arriving late

172
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,710
means triple compensation

173
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,190
and a delayed search
for black iron crystals.

174
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,190
Chief,

175
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,420
the official road ahead has collapsed.

176
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,140
If we don't reach Xixiang soon,

177
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,540
it may hinder the Leader's plan.

178
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,380
Let's see if there's another route.

179
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,220
Alright.

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,500
Everyone, rest here.

181
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,840
(If we could borrow their horses,)

182
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,860
(we might make it to Xixiang on time.)

183
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,870
Who do you think has the best chance

184
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,620
of winning the Wolf Lord Election
this time?

185
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,950
Of course, Xuan Lie.

186
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,070
(They're from Beixuan.)

187
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,470
I heard he was born

188
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,310
with the Xuan's eagle totem
as a birthmark on his neck.

189
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,140
That's the sign of a chosen Xuan Leader.

190
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,360
He and the King come
from the same lineage.

191
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,830
The Wolf Lord position is his for sure.

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,470
Our Leader is formidable too.

193
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,900
What's the use of that?

194
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,640
Young Master,

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,500
Beixuan and Yannan
have a century-old feud.

196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
- They're immoral.
- What do you know?

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,270
They only kill and rob.

198
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,260
Merchants value profit.

199
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,780
If we offer them a better choice

200
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,950
than killing and robbing,

201
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,990
they'll agree.

202
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,430
Negotiating with tigers is too risky.

203
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,950
We should wait for the next caravan.

204
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,190
When will that be?

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,340
Let's go.

206
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,110
Gentlemen,

207
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,900
I am the chief of a caravan

208
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,590
heading to Xixiang for trade.

209
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,350
We encountered horse plague en route,

210
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,660
so we came here

211
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,380
to propose a business deal.

212
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,260
Let them approach.

213
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
What's the matter?

214
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,030
- We wish to borrow horses.
- No deal.

215
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,940
One bolt of kesi
for borrowing your horses

216
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,100
until the next post station.

217
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,740
Kesi?

218
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,780
The Juns' kesi from Yannan
is renowned worldwide,

219
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,200
exclusively supplied to the royals,
and nearly unattainable.

220
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Haven't you heard of it?

221
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,950
I've heard of its reputation, of course.

222
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,830
But it's so rare.

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,740
I wonder

224
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,190
if your kesi is genuine.

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
True kesi appears
as if carved in mid-air.

226
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,070
When sunlight penetrates its weave,

227
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,470
the gaps shimmer from afar

228
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,430
like dewdrops, vivid and lifelike.

229
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,350
Fine.

230
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm from Xixiang

231
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,190
and have traveled this road for years.

232
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,590
With the official road collapsed,

233
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,540
I know of a canyon trail.

234
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,950
If you need me,

235
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,470
I can guide you.

236
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,190
These people don't act like merchants,

237
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,030
and they've been guarding their goods
closely along the way.

238
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,340
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

239
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,370
Once we pass the canyon ahead,

240
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,590
we'll break away asap

241
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,920
before we reach the post station.

242
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,310
Oh, no. They're bandits.

243
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,430
Bandits are coming.

244
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
Everyone, stay alert.

245
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,430
Kill them. Leave no survivors.

246
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,170
Young Master, are you alright?

247
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,030
I'm fine.

248
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,610
Young Master,

249
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,860
the bandits of Tiger Stockade
have entered the canyon.

250
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,240
They're going to raid the caravan.

251
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,780
Find Jun Feifan for me.

252
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,230
Leave no bandits alive.

253
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,300
(Xuan Lie, Xuan Leader, Beixuan)

254
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,590
(These people's clothing and weapons
are different from the bandits.)

255
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,350
(It seems they're not together.)

256
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,760
They're Xuan Lie's men.

257
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,790
Chief,

258
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,890
has our plan been exposed?

259
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,860
Let's fight our way out.

260
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,290
- We must hide our identities.
- OK.

261
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,740
Go.

262
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,950
Young Master!

263
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,380
(Young Master?)

264
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you the chief of this caravan?

265
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,780
Qimin, are you okay?

266
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,310
Young Master, let's go!

267
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,720
Young Master,
we didn't find Jun Feifan.

268
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,860
Chase them. They're just ahead.

269
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,660
Follow this slope and go.

270
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,950
Find a way to return to Yannan.

271
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll hold them off.

272
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,950
No, I'll stay and fight alongside you.

273
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,670
Listen to me.

274
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,470
My life belongs to you.

275
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,830
I swore I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

276
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,310
Qimin.

277
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,350
Master is still waiting
for you to return.

278
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,720
The Jun family needs you.

279
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,220
Go.

280
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
Qimin.

281
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,670
Qimin!

282
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,770
What are you looking at? Go back.

283
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,530
Master is still waiting for you.

284
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,010
The Jun family needs you.

285
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,740
(This weapon is so finely crafted.)

286
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,340
(It must've been made by Jun Feifan.)

287
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,470
Come out.

288
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,150
You're a woman.

289
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,470
Who are you? Where is Jun Feifan?

290
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,190
Jun Feifan?

291
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,990
I don't know who that is.

292
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,950
You're with the Jun caravan,

293
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,870
yet you don't know Jun Feifan?

294
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,920
You must be courting death.

295
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,740
I'm not part of the Jun caravan.

296
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,190
You've got the wrong person.

297
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,460
(Luo Qi, deputy general
of the Xuan, Beixuan)

298
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
Young Master,

299
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,710
we found an exquisite silk product

300
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,190
among the seized goods.

301
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,340
As expected
of a sharp-tongued Jun from Yannan.

302
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,540
Such intricate embroidery.

303
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,900
Miss,

304
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,670
if I'm not mistaken,

305
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,260
this must be
the unique kesi of the Juns.

306
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,190
I've never seen such a thing.

307
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,190
Was it found among my caravan's goods?

308
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,660
See?

309
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,630
As I told you,
you've got the wrong person.

310
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,670
You raided the caravan for wealth.

311
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,400
You can take all the gold,
silver, and silks.

312
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,140
Just let me go.

313
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,500
It seems I've been too kind to you.

314
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,310
Luo Qi.

315
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,260
Do you want to talk now,

316
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,540
or after a little suffering?

317
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,950
What do you want me to say?

318
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,780
I'm just an ordinary merchant.

319
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,870
Traveling with that Beixuan caravan
was purely a coincidence.

320
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,740
(I heard he was born)

321
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,670
(with the Xuan's eagle totem
as a birthmark on his neck.)

322
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,680
(That's the sign
of a chosen Xuan Leader.)

323
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,260
(He's Xuan Lie.)

324
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,660
(I've got an idea.)

325
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,390
You'd better understand

326
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,340
that my patience is limited.

327
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,340
Where did the weapons
you brought come from?

328
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,190
Bought from Yannan.

329
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,820
The Uncontrollable is full of bandits.

330
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,870
They're for self-defense.

331
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,490
This time, they came in handy,
didn't they?

332
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,050
Here's all we have.

333
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
Take them if you want.

334
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,230
However,

335
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,630
compared to my goods,

336
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,780
you might be more interested
in the goods

337
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,720
of the Beixuan caravan.

338
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,100
I noticed they were guarding the goods

339
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,870
in the middle wagon very closely.

340
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,390
A dozen people
who didn't look like regular guards

341
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,500
were watching it.

342
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,710
I suspect there's something

343
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,650
incredibly rare inside.

344
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,630
We have nothing to do
with the Jun caravan,

345
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,390
let alone the Beixuan caravan.

346
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,170
This was purely
an unfortunate disaster for us.

347
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,020
Beixuan caravan? Jun caravan?

348
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,430
How do you know what my target is?

349
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,660
Young Master,

350
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,820
these are the goods
from the Jun caravan,

351
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,630
and those belong to another caravan.

352
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,030
Lift harder.

353
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,050
I can't take it anymore.

354
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,660
Open it.

355
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

356
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,470
These are Beixuan weapons.

357
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,990
Search every crate.

358
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,020
They're using a caravan as cover

359
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,330
to smuggle military supplies.

360
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,360
Though the Five Clans act independently,

361
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,950
smuggling military supplies
is a serious crime.

362
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,820
Which clan dares
to do something so bold?

363
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,950
Spread the word:

364
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,290
Someone is smuggling military supplies
under the guise of trade.

365
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,100
The caravan chief is being held by me

366
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,360
and subjected to severe torture
in the military camp.

367
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,640
Young Master, you're truly wise.

368
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,580
If they know we have hostages,

369
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,870
they'll try to silence them.

370
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,500
Then they'll be walking into our trap.

371
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,230
Young Master,

372
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,740
last night in the cell,
I heard you call for Jun Feifan.

373
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,140
Is she a girl?

374
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,620
Yes.

375
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,990
She's really a woman?

376
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,220
Does that mean
we've caught the wrong person?

377
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,710
That can't be.

378
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,870
I heard the bandits from Tiger Stockade

379
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,300
were targeting the Jun family.

380
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,100
Their intelligence shouldn't be wrong.

381
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,820
The Juns must've known
we were looking for Jun Feifan,

382
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,540
so they spread false info to mislead us.

383
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,870
Among this Yannan caravan,

384
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,670
there's nothing to prove

385
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,780
it's connected to the Jun family.

386
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,470
Except for this bolt of kesi.

387
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,190
Contact our informants.

388
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,840
Investigate how many female relatives
the Juns have

389
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,890
and find out Jun Feifan's
current whereabouts.

390
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,140
Young Master,

391
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,010
Yannan adheres strictly
to etiquette and tradition.

392
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,710
Women's names are rarely disclosed.

393
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,500
Also, getting into Yannan isn't easy.

394
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,060
If it were,

395
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,100
and if Jun Feifan were easy to find,

396
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,330
we'd have gone directly there
to capture him.

397
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,440
Do we need to intercept him
at the Uncontrollable?

398
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,830
Yes.

399
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,710
But failing to capture Jun Feifan
this time

400
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,870
means we can't investigate
the case of Mr. Xuan Shu.

401
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,540
So, we must find him.

402
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,190
General.

403
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,770
The Yannan prisoner has escaped.

404
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
Young Master,

405
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,230
what should we do
with this Yannan prisoner?

406
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,870
Trying to escape?

407
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,300
She's of no use.

408
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,070
Kill her.

409
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Xuan Lie,

410
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,060
you can't kill me.

411
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,340
You know who the young master is?

412
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,500
You know too much.

413
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,830
I definitely can't let you live.

414
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,150
I know where Jun Feifan is.

415
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,100
Yesterday, you swore to me

416
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,300
that you had no connection to the Juns.

417
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,060
Now, what story
are you planning to sell me?

418
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,580
You can kill me with a single gesture.

419
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,230
How would I dare deceive you?

420
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,140
Miss Jun,

421
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,870
you Yannan women are far too delicate.

422
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,060
If I were a Jun,

423
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,990
I'd be enjoying a life of luxury

424
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,780
and indulgence right now.

425
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,390
Why would I appear here, disheveled,

426
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,260
providing you with a laughing stock?

427
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,060
If you're not with a Jun,

428
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,190
how do you know where Jun Feifan is?

429
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,870
You're right,

430
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,020
but you've only guessed half.

431
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Let's say I'm half a Jun.

432
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Actually,

433
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,870
I'm Mr. Feifan's personal maid.

434
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,260
My name is Qi Luo.

435
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,780
Why are you looking at me like that?

436
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,910
I admire how calm
and composed you are when lying.

437
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,500
It's truly impressive.

438
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,060
(Jun)

439
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,300
I've slightly altered
the Jun Trade Token.

440
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,630
(Jun)
The Baigong Token is hidden inside.

441
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,820
Who are you?

442
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,340
I'm truly just a maid.

443
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,390
As for why the Jun Trade Token
is with me,

444
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,300
it's because

445
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,910
Mr. Feifan and I are in love.

446
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
This is the token of our love from him.

447
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,340
You're in love with Jun Feifan?

448
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,150
Where is Jun Feifan now?

449
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,100
We had a horse plague on the way.

450
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,500
We lost half our horses

451
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,190
and couldn't reach Xixiang on time.

452
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,500
Mr. Feifan feared it'd upset
the merchants in Xixiang,

453
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,260
so he went ahead to explain to them.

454
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,340
We agreed

455
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,470
that I'd go to Xixiang
immediately after to meet him.

456
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,260
Why are you disguised as a man?

457
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,470
Why does the caravan member
call you Young Master?

458
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,390
Mr. Feifan was worried that without him,

459
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,100
the caravan members
would lose confidence,

460
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,780
so he ordered me to pretend to be him
with a coarse cloth.

461
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,780
That way, morale wouldn't collapse.

462
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,820
Jun Feifan entrusted you
with the important task

463
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,340
of leading the caravan.

464
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,580
It seems

465
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,060
he holds you in high regard.

466
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,230
I value

467
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,260
this trade token more than my life.

468
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,870
It's a token of love from Mr. Feifan.

469
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,740
Please return it to me, General.

470
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,420
(Jun)

471
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,300
Why so nervous?

472
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,930
Afraid I'll damage it?

473
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,710
It's the token of Mr. Feifan's love.

474
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,340
Of course, I'm nervous.

475
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,940
You're very clever.

476
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
It's a waste for you to be a maid.

477
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,740
You're perceptive and adaptable.

478
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,300
If I were Jun Feifan,

479
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,910
I'd make you my strategist.

480
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,780
Would you use a woman as a strategist?

481
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Talent knows no birthright,

482
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,490
nor does it discriminate by gender.

483
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,680
I'd be more than willing.

484
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,820
(Jun Mansion)

485
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,500
I heard Feifan went with the caravan
to Xixiang as well?

486
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,270
Your Majesty,

487
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,870
Feifan and I searched within Yannan
for black iron crystals

488
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,950
for several months but found nothing.

489
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,260
(Zhao Huang, King of Yannan)
So, Feifan went to Xixiang for this.

490
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,090
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

491
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,990
Feifan and I have never

492
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,230
dared to neglect this important matter.

493
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,830
How confident are you this time?

494
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,470
Well...

495
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,260
I dare not speak prematurely.

496
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,960
The Beixuan Wolf Lord Election is near.

497
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,820
If they unite
the five clans' military power,

498
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,340
their next step will surely be
to attack Yannan.

499
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,390
Our crossbows are severely depleted,

500
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,020
and improving them is urgent.

501
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,390
But you're telling me

502
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,260
you can't guarantee
finding black iron crystals?

503
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,100
Your Majesty,

504
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,020
Feifan and I have never relaxed.

505
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,780
We will spare no effort

506
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,630
to solve the mechanism wear issue

507
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,430
and ensure Yannan's peace and stability.

508
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,100
No need.

509
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,360
You can rest for a while.

510
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,930
We'll discuss the details
of our cooperation later.

511
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,580
Prepare a tent and clean clothes

512
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,420
for this...

513
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,030
young man.

514
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,940
Yes.

515
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,710
Sir, this way.

516
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,900
Young Master,

517
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,300
I feel like you two are...

518
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,470
Young Master,

519
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,210
how did I do with my performance?

520
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,820
That Yannan woman

521
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,430
was so scared she was sweating cold.

522
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,150
She really thought
I was going to kill her.

523
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,950
If I hadn't stopped in time,

524
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,990
you would've cut her nose off.

525
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,990
Young Master,

526
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,580
this is what you taught me.

527
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,260
We need to play our part thoroughly.

528
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,260
You told me she was full of tricks.

529
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,670
If we didn't push her

530
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,260
into a life-or-death dilemma,

531
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,870
how could she be honest with us?

532
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,580
But for upright Beixuan men like us,

533
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,230
treating a helpless woman like this

534
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,100
is inappropriate, right?

535
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,870
A helpless woman?

536
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,550
Yes.

537
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
(Xuan Lie,)

538
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,810
(the undisputed choice
for the Beixuan Wolf Lord.)

539
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,820
(Why is he going through so much trouble
to find Jun Feifan?)

540
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,950
Who is this woman really?

541
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,660
Does she truly know where Jun Feifan is?

542
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,950
She claims to be Jun Feifan's maid

543
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,910
and his lover.

544
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,470
A lover?

545
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,060
It seems Jun Feifan
is quite lucky in love.

546
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,430
Even his chambermaid looks this good.

547
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,270
Do you believe her?

548
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,990
(If he discovers my identity
as Jun Feifan,)

549
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,430
(he only needs to detain me)

550
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,370
(and make the King believe Jun Feifan
has sworn allegiance to Beixuan.)

551
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,990
(With the King's paranoid nature,)

552
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,890
(it will surely implicate my family.)

553
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,830
(I must hide my identity well)

554
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,990
(and find a chance to leave asap.)

555
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,390
Young Master, are you saying

556
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,200
she's still lying
even when facing death?

557
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,580
She indeed has the Jun Trade Token.

558
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,620
She probably does know Jun Feifan.

559
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,580
As for the rest,

560
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,190
we need to verify.

561
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,830
Miss Jun, please sit.

562
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,410
General, who were you calling?

563
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,580
I momentarily forgot
your last name is Qi, not Jun.

564
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,310
Please sit.

565
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,750
Miss Qi Luo,

566
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,950
now you can tell me

567
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,950
where Jun Feifan is, right?

568
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,660
Finding our young master

569
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,790
is easy as pie for me,

570
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,280
but I still need to negotiate
a few terms with you.

571
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,100
Go ahead. What are your terms?

572
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,110
First,

573
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,350
you must guarantee my personal safety.

574
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,190
Don't worry.

575
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
I won't kill you.

576
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,110
Second,

577
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,700
Mr. Feifan entrusted me
with the caravan,

578
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,950
but I failed to keep them safe.

579
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,540
I know I'm no match for you

580
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,430
and can't avenge them,

581
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,830
so please give them a proper burial.

582
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,950
It was chaotic.
The swords are indiscriminate.

583
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,580
Killing the Jun caravan
was never my intention.

584
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,950
Alright, no need to say more.

585
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,930
I'll give them a proper burial.

586
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,700
You haven't eaten for the past two days.

587
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,350
Eat something.

588
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,750
I can agree to the first two terms.

589
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,140
Now, can you tell me

590
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,470
where Jun Feifan is?

591
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,460
Not yet.

592
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,470
Are you playing me?

593
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,760
General, you're overthinking.

594
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,470
There's still one matter
left unresolved.

595
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,310
Tell me.

596
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,750
General, may I ask

597
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,470
what you need from Mr. Feifan?

598
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,140
If it puts him in danger,

599
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,830
then of course, I cannot betray him.

600
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,580
Don't worry. I won't kill him.

601
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,350
When eliminating bandits in this area,

602
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,470
I've seen many Beixuan people

603
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,910
taking their families to the mountains
to become bandits.

604
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,220
Beixuan is economically weak

605
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,310
and can't provide them with livelihoods.

606
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,120
I've heard Jun Feifan

607
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,790
has helped Yannan's economy thrive

608
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,350
with a joint capital management system.

609
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,830
I want to ask him about it.

610
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,380
If we can help boost

611
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,470
Beixuan's economy,

612
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,860
the Beixuan people

613
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,100
can have a stable life.

614
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,460
General, your concern for the people

615
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,880
is truly a blessing for Beixuan.

616
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,500
Mr. Feifan is in Xixiang now.

617
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,980
I know the merchants he's working with.

618
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,940
I can take you to find him.

619
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
But I have a third condition.

620
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,980
I need to bring my goods
to Xixiang as well

621
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,300
to protect Mr. Feifan's reputation
and the Juns' credibility.

622
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,700
I didn't expect Miss Qi Luo

623
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,780
to be so loyal to the Juns.

624
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,500
That's not loyalty.

625
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,980
I betrayed Mr. Feifan to save my life.

626
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,980
I just want some
peace of mind in the end.

627
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,580
General, you need to decide quickly.

628
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,460
If Mr. Feifan knows
the caravan was eliminated,

629
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,700
it will be hard to find him again.

630
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,080
I agree to your terms.

631
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,220
We'll set off for Xixiang tomorrow.

632
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Then I won't disturb you any longer.
