17
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
General,

18
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,910
judging by the pulse,

19
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,340
she should be a woman, right?

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,270
Just do your job.

21
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,710
No unnecessary questions.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,950
It's toxic heat
due to regional differences,

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,620
unsuitable climate,

24
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,860
and an unhealed wound.

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,400
If the wound isn't treated soon,

26
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,300
it may fester and endanger her life.

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,300
There are no women in the camp.

28
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,960
General, please take care of it.

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
I thought you were an honorable man,

30
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,640
but it turns out you're a rogue
taking advantage of others' weakness.

31
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,420
Do you think I need
to take advantage of your weakness?

32
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,390
Since you're awake,
treat your own wound.

33
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,670
Tonight, lead a team to the canyon

34
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,950
and properly bury

35
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,900
the Jun caravan.

36
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,670
Yes, Young Master.

37
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,470
We'll set off for Xixiang tomorrow.

38
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,650
We haven't found the mastermind
behind the smuggling.

39
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,580
De Lihan will stay
with five light cavalrymen

40
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,330
to lure the enemy.

41
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,190
Young Master,

42
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,300
the Wolf Lord Election is imminent.

43
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,710
We should hurry back to Liangzhou

44
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,760
and Royal City to prepare.

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,230
Why are we going to Xixiang?

46
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,990
She said Jun Feifan was in Xixiang,

47
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,670
and she could help us find him.

48
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,980
Young Master,

49
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,070
didn't you say her words
can't be trusted?

50
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,110
Finding Jun Feifan
is tied to my parents' case.

51
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,550
Whether it's true or not,

52
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,670
we must go.

53
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,470
Young Master, everything is ready.

54
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,590
We can depart at any time.

55
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,750
Good.

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,580
Miss Qi Luo,

57
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,790
we're leaving.

58
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,310
General,

59
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,030
my wounds are too severe.

60
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,790
Could you prepare a carriage for me?

61
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,420
What trick are you up to now?

62
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,940
General, you're overthinking.

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm only worried
about delaying our trip.

64
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,650
With so many capable officers
under your command,

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,500
do you really think I can escape?

66
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,060
No one escapes under my watch,

67
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,020
except through death.

68
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,310
Luo Qi.

69
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,070
Young Master.

70
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,350
Prepare a carriage.

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,150
Yes, I'm on it now.

72
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,710
(The river ahead)

73
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,420
(is the best place for escape.)

74
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,740
(I said I needed to clean my wound,)

75
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,150
(and he shamelessly followed me.)

76
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,910
(If I miss this chance,)

77
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,430
(it'll be hard to find
another excuse to escape.)

78
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,940
(I need a plan
to make him lower his guard.)

79
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,950
General,

80
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,230
I need to undress to clean my wound.

81
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,710
Could you step aside?

82
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,990
Stop right there.

83
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,380
This vast expanse

84
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,350
is the perfect place for you

85
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,390
to meet your end, General.

86
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,110
Dying here with you

87
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,310
would truly be fitting.

88
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,860
You can choose to live or die.

89
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,310
You're insane.

90
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,210
Why hasn't the young master returned?

91
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,310
Deputy Luo,

92
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,070
the young master and that man

93
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,630
have been in the woods for a long time.

94
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Should we send someone to check?

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,860
Just ahead lies the Death Desert.

96
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,700
What?

97
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,710
The Death Desert?

98
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,190
You could've gotten out on your own,

99
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,310
but you had to drag me down.

100
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm still kinder than you.

101
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
What are you doing?

102
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,150
It's signal flare.

103
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,470
Return to the Royal City tonight,

104
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,640
find Deputy He at the Annexe,

105
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,140
and have him report this to the King.

106
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
Yes.

107
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,310
(Young Master,)

108
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,990
(please stay safe and sound.)

109
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,990
You said you'd take me to Jun Feifan.

110
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,430
Why the sudden change of your mind?

111
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,980
Don't you think
that's a ridiculous question?

112
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,740
Don't you know
people are born fickle?

113
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,710
I thought the Juns
valued keeping their word.

114
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,070
I'm only half a Jun.

115
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,170
So, you've been lying to me all along.

116
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,470
Jun Feifan isn't in Xixiang.

117
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,640
Now that things have come to this,

118
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,620
there's no need to lie anymore.

119
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,230
I have no idea

120
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,020
where Mr. Feifan is.

121
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,660
When Mr. Feifan left,

122
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,460
he said he was going
to find fragrant jade.

123
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,350
He gave me the trade token

124
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,470
and told me to impersonate him
on this trip.

125
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,190
It's just my bad luck

126
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,070
to have run into you.

127
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,070
Where is he?

128
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,020
How should I know?

129
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,710
Which part of your words

130
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,310
is true and which part is false?

131
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,310
What do you think?

132
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,270
It's okay.

133
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,660
Once we leave the Death Desert,

134
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,660
we'll settle this properly.

135
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,310
Rest for a while.

136
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,900
It's Jiji grass.

137
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,620
Ahead...

138
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,780
There must be a water source ahead.

139
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,300
(Xuanwu Palace)

140
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,990
Lie has gone missing?

141
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,060
(Xuan Xu, King of Beixuan)

142
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,100
The young master and that Yannan man

143
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,870
vanished together in the Death Desert.

144
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,240
(He Jiyao, Xuan Deputy General)
With the Election near,

145
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,880
Luo Qi feared
the situation might change,

146
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,990
so he asked me to inform you first.

147
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,300
He will lead Twelve Light Cavalry

148
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,230
to continue searching
for the young master.

149
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,750
What did you say?

150
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,150
Lie is missing?

151
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,750
Princess.

152
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,110
(Xuan Qingkou, Princess of Beixuan)

153
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,750
Xu,

154
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,190
Lie is the God of War of Beixuan.

155
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,390
He's the most powerful person.

156
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,870
How could he vanish without reason?

157
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,950
With the Wolf Lord Election near,

158
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,630
Lie's disappearance will inevitably

159
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,670
stir up trouble among the other clans.

160
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,670
Take a few personal guards at once

161
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,340
and assist Luo Qi in a secret search.

162
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,910
Remember: Keep it discreet.

163
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,270
Understood.

164
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,430
Issue my order:

165
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,260
Xuan Lie shall be
on a private mission for me.

166
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,250
He shall set out immediately.

167
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,230
I want to go too.

168
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,710
Nonsense.

169
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,190
The Uncontrollable is a mix of chaos

170
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,390
beyond the reach of law.

171
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,920
How can a noble lady like you

172
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,430
go to such a place?

173
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,100
Lie once saved my life.

174
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,950
Now that he's missing,

175
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,790
I should go find him.

176
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,580
If you go along,

177
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,460
he'll be distracted taking care of you.

178
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,710
How will he search for him then?

179
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,390
(Nobody can stop me)

180
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,640
(from doing what I've decided to do.)

181
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,670
(Adherence to Duties)
Xuan Lie discovered

182
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,020
the weapons we smuggled?

183
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,260
And Xi Da was captured?

184
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,510
Father, please don't be mad.

185
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,190
(Xi Mo, Young Master of the Xi, Beixuan)
We have Xi Da's family.

186
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,230
He wouldn't dare betray us.

187
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,390
Only the dead can be trusted.

188
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,910
(Xi Changkun, Xi Leader, Beixuan)
Have Death Warriors kill him.

189
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,100
Xuan Lie mustn't get any evidence.

190
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,510
Yes.

191
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,420
Father,

192
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,670
city guards report

193
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,600
that after He Jiyao received a message
from Luo Qi's confidant,

194
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,900
he entered the palace overnight.

195
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,290
Royal spies also confirmed

196
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,100
that Xuan Lie appears to be missing
in the Death Desert.

197
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,580
Missing?

198
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,150
If Xuan Lie dies,

199
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,870
who among the remaining clans

200
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,190
could challenge you
for the position of Wolf Lord?

201
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,990
If that's true,

202
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,090
it's naturally a good thing.

203
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,510
Father,

204
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,990
I'll station people at all key routes

205
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,020
from the Uncontrollable to Liangzhou.

206
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,430
Even if Xuan Lie
escapes the Death Desert,

207
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,870
he'll never leave
the Uncontrollable alive.

208
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,940
Good idea.

209
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,820
Though Xuan Lie has gone missing,

210
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,740
Xi Da must still be killed.

211
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,360
I'll head to Liangzhou first

212
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,150
and wait for your good news.

213
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,510
Rest assured, Father.

214
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,340
Miss Qi Luo, you're up.

215
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,670
Why are you haunting me like a ghost?

216
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,060
If I hadn't picked you up in time,

217
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,780
you'd already be a dried corpse

218
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,710
or dragged off and eaten

219
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,580
by wolves.

220
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,180
What?

221
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,100
You won't even say thank you?

222
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,230
You didn't save me

223
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,670
just to hear a thank you, right?

224
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,300
Then why?

225
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,100
Your leg is injured,
and you can't move freely.

226
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,630
You have to work with me

227
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,910
to leave this desert.

228
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,630
Even if both my legs were crippled,

229
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,340
I could still make it out.

230
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,030
Yes.

231
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,540
I know you're remarkable

232
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,430
and renowned throughout the land.

233
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,060
But with the Wolf Lord Election near,

234
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,020
disappearing for too long

235
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,060
might not work in your favor.

236
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,250
I might as well kill you now

237
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,440
and reclaim
the Wolf Lord position later.

238
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,820
I don't mind dying,

239
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,260
but I'd hate to drag you down with me.

240
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,100
If your leg wound isn't treated,

241
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,500
it'll fester, rot,
and require amputation.

242
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,060
Forget about saving your leg.

243
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,190
You won't survive the night.

244
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,340
Will you untie me now?

245
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,430
I swear on the life as a Jun maid

246
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,340
that I won't leave you stranded again.

247
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,540
Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning.

248
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,560
It seems the only one
you care about is Jun Feifan.

249
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,300
I swear on Mr. Jun Feifan's life

250
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,740
that if I try to escape again,

251
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,740
may Jun Feifan die dismembered
and exposed in the wild,

252
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,060
and may I never win his heart.

253
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,990
It seems this time,

254
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,670
Miss Qi Luo has finally faced reality.

255
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,260
A weak woman,

256
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,390
with neither water nor food,

257
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,580
needs to escape
after she leaves the desert.

258
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,630
Your leg wound is severe.

259
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,580
We must leave the desert asap.

260
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,150
It's just a small wound.

261
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,770
Nothing worth mentioning.

262
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,860
Save it.

263
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,780
This is all the water we have.

264
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,670
I saw some Jiji grass today.

265
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,670
There should be water nearby.

266
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll look for it tomorrow.

267
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,910
I've never met a woman like you.

268
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,430
Your first reaction to a problem
is how to solve it,

269
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,260
not to complain.

270
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,050
Why not establish your household?

271
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,950
With your wit and talent,

272
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,910
if you worked hard,

273
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,500
you could achieve more than Jun Feifan.

274
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,340
I'm just a woman.

275
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,400
Mr. Feifan is a once-in-a-generation
business genius.

276
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,260
How could I ever surpass him?

277
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,470
Nonsense.

278
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,670
You're unconfident.

279
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,740
This isn't like you.

280
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,340
We've only just met,

281
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,630
yet you act like you know me so well.

282
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,630
Though it's only been a few days,

283
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,390
I know you aren't a parasitic vine.

284
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,470
In Yannan, tradition dictates

285
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,670
that women can't establish a household

286
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,780
nor hold power in business.

287
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,670
Then come to Beixuan.

288
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,300
In the Xuan Clan,

289
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,740
as long as you have talent,

290
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,200
your gender won't matter.

291
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,010
Are you trying to fool me like a child?

292
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,340
Yannan and Beixuan
are like fire and water.

293
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,150
If I went to Beixuan,

294
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,190
I'd have no place to stand.

295
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,990
When Yannan belongs to Beixuan,

296
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,300
I'll ensure that every talented person

297
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
has a chance to shine.

298
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,060
Father, I heard from Uncle Ling

299
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,600
that Feifan and the caravan
went missing in the Uncontrollable.

300
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,790
Impossible.

301
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,950
Feifan's been resourceful
since childhood,

302
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,710
and Qimin is with him.

303
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,820
They'll be fine.

304
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,980
I'll take people there
to find her right away.

305
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,940
Stop.

306
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,490
The Uncontrollable
is extremely dangerous.

307
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,190
How can you, a woman, go there?

308
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
Jiangjuan,

309
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,300
Father is right.

310
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,990
You are just a weak woman.

311
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,870
You mustn't take such a risk alone.

312
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,780
Are we supposed to sit by
and do nothing?

313
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,670
Searching must be done quietly.

314
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,630
Besides, the business conference
is imminent.

315
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,800
If certain people
take advantage of this,

316
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,190
it could harm Feifan and our family.

317
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,230
Why go to war?

318
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,060
To ensure there will be no wars,

319
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,910
so our descendants can live in peace.

320
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,020
If we stop fighting now,

321
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,950
won't there be peace in the world?

322
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,670
You're oversimplifying things.

323
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,950
Only a strong nation
has the power to stop wars.

324
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,360
Yannan has never thought
of invading other nations.

325
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,100
Xixiang is weak

326
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,100
and wouldn't dare stir up trouble.

327
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,230
It's only Beixuan,

328
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,020
bloodthirsty and cruel,

329
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,910
that could come up
with such a lame excuse.

330
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,230
Bloodthirsty and cruel?

331
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,780
So, this is how you see Beixuan.

332
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,390
Isn't it true?

333
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,430
To you,

334
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,100
Yannan people must seem loathsome too.

335
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,580
(In Memory; Late Father; Late Mother)

336
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,260
No matter what you think,

337
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,430
in today's world,

338
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,400
using war to stop killing

339
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,190
is the best way to maintain peace.

340
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,150
Protecting Beixuan is my duty.

341
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,020
I won't allow anything to endanger it.

342
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,060
You'll slaughter commoners for this.

343
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,820
No one likes killing.

344
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,780
But without power,

345
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,780
however you call out,

346
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,990
even if it's for justice,

347
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,820
few will heed you.

348
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,990
With absolute strength,

349
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,060
no matter the schemes and plots,

350
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,260
the strong will crush them with ease.

351
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,530
General, put your doctrine

352
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,580
of strength aside for now.

353
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,150
The priority is figuring out

354
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,600
how to leave this desert.

355
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,710
(What kind of person is he?)

356
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,470
(Why is he looking for Jun Feifan?)

357
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,020
(His forehead is so hot.)

358
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,120
(It seems his wound has worsened.)

359
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,990
Without me,

360
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,060
you can't get out of this Death Desert.

361
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,330
If you don't believe me, have a try.

362
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,620
You've tried?

363
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,550
You can't leave?

364
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,190
Didn't we agree
to leave this desert together?

365
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,510
Aren't you afraid?

366
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,950
Since you've returned,

367
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,710
I'll trust you this once.

368
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,990
This cactus can cool heat and detoxify.

369
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,860
Bear with it.

370
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,330
(Yao City)

371
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,190
What's inside?

372
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,860
Nothing.

373
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,190
You there, stop. Don't run.

374
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,230
Come in.

375
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,830
Deputy He,

376
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,230
a scout brings urgent news:

377
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,580
Last night, someone spotted

378
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,910
a Xuanyu Army signal flare.

379
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,990
Where?

380
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,340
On the northwestern edge
of the Death Desert.

381
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,910
I'll distract them. You go.

382
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,710
Didn't we agree to escape together?

383
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,450
At least one of us should survive.

384
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,310
Now go.

385
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,710
Why are you back?

386
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,340
The terrain here is complicated.

387
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,430
I wouldn't get far anyway.

388
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,570
It's better to work together

389
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,490
and fight for a chance.

390
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,230
Watch out!

391
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,150
It's the young master.

392
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,310
We've finally found him.

393
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,750
Young Master.

394
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,380
(Making use of the surroundings.)

395
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,740
(The principle is similar
to the Three-Arrow Crossbow.)

396
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,390
(Who exactly are you?)

397
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,750
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)
How could Feifan go missing?

398
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,420
I told him

399
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,870
the trade route was dangerous.

400
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,860
(Song Wei, Grand Chancellor)
I tried to stop him,

401
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,750
but he insisted.

402
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
And now,

403
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,180
he's vanished halfway through.

404
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,990
The Uncontrollable is a chaotic place,

405
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,500
beyond the control of any nation.

406
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,270
I wonder if Feifan

407
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,390
is safe there.

408
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
So,

409
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,060
I want to ask you for help
in finding Feifan.

410
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,470
What are you doing?

411
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,990
Feifan worked tirelessly to develop

412
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,540
the Yannan economy.

413
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,270
Now that he's gone missing,

414
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,060
I will try my best to search for him.

415
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,270
This...

416
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,310
Are you insulting me?

417
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,390
Grand Chancellor, this...

418
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,270
Zheng Yuan.

419
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,050
Grand Chancellor.

420
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,620
(Zheng Yuan, Song Wei's butler, Yannan)

421
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,580
Send some capable people
to the Uncontrollable.

422
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,950
We must find Jun Feifan.

423
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,910
Remember:

424
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,310
Keep it secret.

425
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,350
I just passed off inferior goods

426
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,790
at a higher price,

427
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,210
and now Uncle wants me
to go door-to-door for compensation.

428
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,270
Father, where does that leave my face

429
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,430
as Mr. Yujue?

430
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,060
(Jun Chengsong, second branch head)
Your uncle has shown mercy.

431
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,140
If Jun Feifan were here...

432
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,220
Jun Feifan?

433
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,660
(Jun Yujue, eldest son)
I don't think he'd come back.

434
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,500
But son,

435
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,220
we can't make conclusions too soon.

436
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,580
After all, he's only missing.

437
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,700
We don't know if he's dead or alive.

438
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,060
The bandits in the Uncontrollable

439
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,140
took my money.

440
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,470
So, they'll get the job done.

441
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,350
Once it's done,
the position of Jun Manager

442
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,060
will be ours to claim.

443
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,230
Son,

444
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,180
the show is about to start.

445
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,110
Young Master,

446
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,870
I'll change Mr. Qi's clothes.

447
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,830
No need. Leave them here.

448
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,660
Shouldn't you be in the Royal City?

449
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,020
How did you end up here?

450
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,620
Luo Qi sent people to the Royal City
overnight with a message.

451
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,700
Once I received the news,

452
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
I left the city right away
to search for you.

453
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,220
When I arrived in Yao City,

454
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,310
I saw the signal flare

455
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,390
and rushed over immediately.

456
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,610
The King was worried
about alerting other clans,

457
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,700
so he sent just me

458
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,540
and a few elite soldiers to find you.

459
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,990
The Wolf Lord Election is imminent.

460
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,540
All clans are likely watching
your movements,

461
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,140
especially Xi Changkun.

462
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,140
He's set on becoming the next Wolf Lord.

463
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,750
I don't think your disappearance

464
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,350
can't be hidden for long.

465
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,750
Where's Luo Qi?

466
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,990
I've let him know

467
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,840
that he should come here
with Twelve Light Cavalry here first.

468
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,790
Xi Changkun is meticulous.

469
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,350
He won't act

470
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,750
without absolute certainty.

471
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,790
We still have time.

472
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,020
There's only one room here.

473
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,390
I'm afraid you'll have
to make do tonight.

474
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,430
Should Mr. Qi rest with me?

475
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,270
No need.

476
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,500
He will

477
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,950
sleep here tonight.

478
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,540
He saved my life,

479
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,150
so we must show proper respect.

480
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,630
Yes.

481
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,060
Did you change my clothes?

482
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,540
Your clothes are dirty and torn.

483
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,950
What's wrong

484
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,820
with offering a hand?

485
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,390
How could you change my clothes?

486
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,760
Don't you understand the propriety
between men and women?

487
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,870
You're already Jun Feifan's woman.

488
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm not interested in women
who belong to someone else.

489
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,670
You...

490
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,950
I had the cook help you
with the clothes.

491
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,390
I didn't touch you.

492
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,700
Miss Qi Luo,
why are you reacting so strongly?

493
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I belong to Mr. Feifan,

494
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,700
so I must protect myself for his sake.

495
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,390
You've tricked me multiple times
for your young master.

496
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,060
Why should I keep my word?

497
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,270
How bold.

498
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,180
General, there's no need to rush.

499
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,180
No one knows Mr. Feifan

500
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
better than I do.

501
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,790
I just can't tell you where he is yet,

502
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,910
but that doesn't mean I can't.

503
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,390
The longer you drag this out,

504
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,350
the more I'll start to question
whether Jun Feifan...

505
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,190
In three months,

506
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,990
the Juns will hold a business meeting.

507
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,620
Mr. Feifan will definitely appear
in the Royal Capital.

508
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,540
That's when I'll fulfill my promise.

509
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,540
How can you be so sure

510
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,480
that he'll definitely appear
at the business meeting?

511
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,580
He knows better than anyone

512
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
that if he doesn't return,

513
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,540
the Jun branches will cause trouble.

514
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,180
The managers of joint-run businesses
and the commoners

515
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,270
won't support Mr. Feifan

516
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,750
as the Jun Manager anymore,

517
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,700
and the Juns will fall.

518
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,750
The empire Mr. Feifan built

519
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,430
will not be handed over to others.

520
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,350
So, no matter where he is,

521
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,310
he must return
to Yannan's Royal City that day.

522
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,790
General,

523
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,310
that will be your chance.

524
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,870
If you don't believe me,

525
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,410
you can send someone to check.

526
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,180
Everything I've said is true.

527
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,020
In the desert,

528
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,750
you risked your life and abandoned me

529
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,500
multiple times for Jun Feifan.

530
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,020
Why are you so quick to help now?

531
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,990
Because I've realized something.

532
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,060
If you don't let me go,

533
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,570
I won't be able to leave anyway.

534
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,830
And it's easy for you to kill me.

535
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,220
However sincere I am to Mr. Feifan,

536
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,910
my life matters the most.

537
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,020
You are a practical person.

538
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,020
How clear-headed.

539
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,470
The longer I spend with you,
the more I find you

540
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,350
a fascinating person.

541
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,430
It's hard to let go.
