17
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,040
Isn't she Xuan Lie's maid?

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
Why is she still with you?

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,510
I belong to Miss Qiluo,

20
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,920
not the general.

21
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,680
No matter what happens,

22
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll stay by Miss Qiluo's side.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,010
What a failure Xuan Lie is.

24
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,430
He couldn't even keep a maid.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Let's talk business.

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,520
In the next two matches,

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,630
we can't afford to lose.

28
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,960
Miss Qiluo, you've seen the environment,

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,310
so it'd be a great help if you could

30
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,560
help my father win the match.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
What about your promise to me?

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,750
How's it going?

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,270
Don't worry.

34
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,030
The mine has been repaired.

35
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,960
Tomorrow, the first batch
of black iron crystals

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,120
will be shipped to Yannan.

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,030
How about the trade pact?

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,710
It needs your father's official seal.

39
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,310
My father's official seal?

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Then I'll need to report this
to my father.

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I see.

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,010
Then there's no need to trouble you.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,080
I thought you were the future heir
of the Xi Clan,

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
but I didn't expect

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
you can't even control a mine.

46
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,470
That's not what I meant.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,400
It's just a mine. I can decide on it.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
As for the official seal,

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll find a way.

50
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
Mr. Xi,

51
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,560
the terrain here is complicated.

52
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,840
Why not set traps early here

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,870
while exploring the terrain?

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,590
You can lay sharp blades here.

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,080
Once Xuan Lie and Luo Zhizhou get here,

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,910
you could easily

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,030
win the match, right?

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,280
I understand.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,840
If we set spike traps underground,

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,910
when the Xuan and Luo are here,

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
their horses will surely get injured.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,590
Miss Qiluo, you're quite the strategist.

63
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,400
I never thought of such a weapon

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,680
to resist the enemy.

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,030
Miss Qiluo, your hair is messy.

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,520
Why is Qiluo...?

67
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
General Lie,

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,520
how could you just watch Qiluo

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,190
stand with Xi Mo?

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,960
Whoever she sides with now

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
has nothing to do with me.

72
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,880
Qiluo, come here.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,980
I have something to ask you.

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,840
Zhaomin,

75
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,000
Miss Qiluo is now mine.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
If you want to take her,

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
you need my permission first, right?

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,480
Do I need your permission
to speak to Qiluo?

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,600
- Who are you?
- I...

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,270
Your time with the terrain
is running out.

81
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,480
You should go and prepare.

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Don't worry.

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,870
I'll get it done tonight.

84
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
There are many animal traps here.

85
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,120
You should be careful.

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,700
Thanks for the reminder.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Qiluo,

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,190
you've seen their methods.

89
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,240
You can't be sincerely
siding with them, right?

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Zhaomin,

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,580
I'm doing this willingly.

92
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,070
Why?

93
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,430
In this world,

94
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,360
there are no absolute enemies
or friends.

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,680
Do you remember the fragrant stone

96
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,830
I asked you and Mr. Sun for?

97
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,430
Does the Xi Clan have it?

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,520
Yes.

99
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,970
So, I have to make this deal

100
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,340
with the Xi Clan.

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
But

102
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,440
is a business deal

103
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,920
more important than a friendship?

104
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,030
Qiluo,

105
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,390
I don't believe you'd do this.

106
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,220
I've said what I needed to say.

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,510
You can choose to believe it or not.

108
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,630
No matter what happens,

109
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,140
I'll still consider you a friend.

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,770
I'm not interested in a friend
as unctuous as you.

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,510
Good for Jun Qiluo.

112
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,000
Yesterday, she was still with Lie,

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,430
and today, she's joined the Xi Clan.

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Qingming,

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
what is it about someone

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,270
as unctuous as her
that makes you so loyal to her?

117
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,070
The Queen Mother is here.

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
Greetings, Mother.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Qingkou,

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,190
I had people prepare
your favorite roasted lamb.

121
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,040
Will you join me for a meal today?

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,270
Mother, have a seat.

123
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Please, sit.

124
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,190
Sit down.

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
Qingkou,

126
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,000
you haven't had a meal with me
in a long time.

127
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,870
Today there's no match,

128
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,340
and you have nothing to do.

129
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,840
You should spend time with me.

130
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,430
Yes, Mother.

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
How poor my memory is.

132
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,700
I forgot to bring
the few jars of good wine

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,270
I had prepared.

134
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,750
Take him to fetch two jars.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,830
Make sure you take the best aged wine.

136
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,470
Yes.

137
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,150
Let's go.

138
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,670
Mother.

139
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,830
It's fine.

140
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Let's go.

141
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,020
(Wine)

142
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,430
The wine the Queen Mother brought
is inside.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
Go in.

144
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,600
The Queen Mother has instructed.

145
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,190
Handle it carefully.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,430
Young Master, it's all been checked.

147
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,270
Everything is ready.

148
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,750
Let's go back to the camp.

149
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,590
General Lie.

150
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
General Lie.

151
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,240
This is what I carefully selected.

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,180
I want you to have it.

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,260
Thank you, Princess,
but I can't accept it.

154
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,150
General Lie,

155
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,310
my mother says
that if a woman likes a man,

156
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,560
she should give him a sachet.

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,190
Though I didn't make this one,

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,950
I found out

159
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,600
that you don't like

160
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
strong scents.

161
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,870
This is jasmine fragrance,

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
light and elegant.

163
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,360
Since you'll be competing soon,

164
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,480
this sachet will also bring you
peace and good luck.

165
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,470
General Lie,

166
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
do you like it?

167
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
Thank you for the kind gesture.

168
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,790
General Lie,

169
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,630
don't you like it?

170
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,920
Please stay, Princess.

171
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,600
The young master doesn't need
this girly thing.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
General Lie,

173
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,080
what do you really want?

174
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,900
Emeralds and gemstones?

175
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,630
Or should I change
the color of the sachet?

176
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
How about red?

177
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,890
I want the black iron crystal mine.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,910
The black iron crystal mine?

179
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,480
Why do you want that?

180
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,870
I see.

181
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
General Lie,

182
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,510
you want to punish

183
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,870
that Yannan girl, right?

184
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,630
Yannan people are so petty,

185
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,720
betraying you

186
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,910
over a small deal.

187
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
- Don't worry...
- Princess,

188
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,870
I don't need it.

189
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,360
General Lie,

190
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,510
I have genuine feelings for you.

191
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,320
This is a small gesture from me.

192
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,200
My Lady,

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,790
is it really impossible
for you and General Lie?

194
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,150
I don't think Mr. Xi is someone
who can help you.

195
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,950
Are you really going to side
with the Xi Clan?

196
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,910
My relationship with the general
has always been one of mutual benefit.

197
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,200
Since he can't give me what I want,

198
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,960
I naturally have to find
a better option.

199
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,960
A wise bird chooses
the best tree to perch on.

200
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,360
I always thought

201
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,630
the general would eventually marry you.

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,550
Isn't he more suited to the Princess
of the Xi Clan?

203
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,750
Dongyin.

204
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,510
Endure it.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Does it hurt?

206
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,750
No.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,510
I don't think you can walk now.

208
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
I'll carry you back.

209
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,840
No, My Lady.

210
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Give me your hand.

211
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,550
My Lady, I'm just a servant.

212
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,390
You can't do this.

213
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,720
Stop talking. Give me your hand.

214
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,610
- This...
- I'll take you back for treatment.

215
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,120
How could you get caught
in a beast trap?

216
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,390
Just now, Xi Mo said

217
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,870
there are many traps here.

218
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,600
You need to be extra cautious.

219
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,670
Do you want me to see
the Princess like this,

220
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,450
or will you send the wine back yourself?

221
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,300
Luckily, it didn't injure the bones.

222
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,720
You're different from other women.

223
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,650
You're bleeding due to the beast trap,

224
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,630
but you're so quiet.

225
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,270
I'm just a servant

226
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,910
with thick skin.

227
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,360
This small injury doesn't hurt.

228
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,790
My Lady, I'm your servant.

229
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,440
You can't treat me like this.

230
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
I...

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,270
Don't say that again.

232
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,320
You've taken good care of me,

233
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,550
so I'll treat you the same way.

234
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,840
You know I don't regard you
as a servant.

235
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,820
Good.

236
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,910
Stay here and don't move.

237
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,050
I'll go get more medicine.

238
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,110
Luo Qi.

239
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,510
Young Master.

240
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
How are you?

241
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
Don't worry, Young Master.

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,270
I'm strong and healthy. I'm fine.

243
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
By the way,

244
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,170
Young Master,

245
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,790
I received this
from the spies in Yannan

246
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,200
a few days ago before I got injured.

247
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,750
Jun Feifan is not in Qian City,

248
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,390
and he didn't go to Execution Valley

249
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,080
to exchange for Miss Jun as agreed.

250
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,600
Only the butler, Ling,

251
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,670
received the Xixiang caravan
with Jun Feifan.

252
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,110
The caravan left immediately after.

253
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,120
Since then, no one has seen Jun Feifan

254
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,630
who once appeared in the Royal Capital.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
Also, Young Master,

256
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,200
the letter says
that Jun Chengliu recently

257
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,960
hired a private Armed Escort.

258
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,510
A private Armed Escort?

259
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,360
Are they also looking for Jun Feifan?

260
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,390
Jun Feifan is really cunning.

261
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,320
He left no trace behind.

262
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
Young Master,

263
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,270
should we test Miss Jun again?

264
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,710
Young Master,

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
did you really have a fight
with Miss Jun?

266
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
Though Miss Jun is smart,

267
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
she doesn't understand the situation.

268
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,550
How could she join the Xi Clan

269
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,670
in front of so many people?

270
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,780
- You even went into the woods...
- Stop.

271
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,200
Don't mention that name again.

272
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,080
What are you doing?

273
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,160
Eat your meal properly.

274
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,560
Mother,

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,390
why hasn't the wine come yet?

276
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,870
Don't rush.

277
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,200
This was your favorite dish
when you were a child.

278
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Eat some first.

279
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
Queen Mother,

280
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,510
he's gone.

281
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
What?

282
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,210
Are you off to play again?

283
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm going to find Qingming.

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,910
Just stay here.

285
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,840
You can't go anywhere.

286
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,920
How dare you!

287
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,510
What are you doing?

288
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,710
Qingkou.

289
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,350
What's wrong?

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
Qingkou, I'm your mother.

291
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,630
Why?

292
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,000
Why do you have to eliminate

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,030
everyone around me?

294
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,200
What did I do wrong?

295
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,960
Go bring Xuan Lie here.

296
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,140
Hurry!

297
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,990
Yes.

298
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,630
Your Majesty.

299
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Qingkou usually listens to you.

300
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,150
Please help me.

301
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Qingkou.

302
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,750
Qingkou.

303
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,110
It's me.

304
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Lie.

305
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,030
Mother has killed someone again.

306
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,440
She killed my Qingming.

307
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,670
Ever since I was a child,
Mother has destroyed

308
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,870
everything I liked.

309
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,600
Qingming has great martial skills.
He should be fine.

310
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,600
Let me find him for you, okay?

311
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,080
Is that true?

312
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,080
I never lie to you, right?

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
Right.

314
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
You've never lied to me.

315
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,390
You will help me find Qingming, right?

316
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,670
You rest for now.

317
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,000
I promise he'll appear soon.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
Okay?

319
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
Lie,

320
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,960
you must bring

321
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,150
Qingming back safely.

322
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,350
Don't worry.

323
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,870
Your Majesty, don't worry.

324
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,750
Qingkou is fine.

325
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,750
Why is she so concerned
about that servant?

326
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,960
Why does she keep blaming me?

327
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,790
Don't worry about it, Your Majesty.

328
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,870
I only have this wooden ball.

329
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,240
Can you return it to me?

330
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,000
- Go and play.
- Yi.

331
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,990
Mother.

332
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,920
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

333
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,960
Yi is being unreasonable.

334
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,770
Please forgive him, Mr. Luo.

335
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,630
It's okay.

336
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,440
Your Ladyship, it's getting late.

337
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,340
It's cold outside. Let's head back.

338
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,960
Mother,

339
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,440
let me play for just a little longer.

340
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,280
Just a little.

341
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,160
Alright.

342
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
But it's chilly at night.

343
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,590
How about you

344
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,310
put on an extra coat
before playing, okay?

345
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
Alright.

346
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,390
Xin.

347
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,910
Yes.

348
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,670
Let's go.

349
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,830
When we were in the Palace,

350
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
I didn't dare to let him play like this,

351
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
lest he'd offend other Princes
and get punished.

352
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,760
I forgot.

353
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Congrats on winning the first match.

354
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,920
It's the coldest days of winter now.

355
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,110
Your old illness might act up again.

356
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,160
There are two more matches to go.

357
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,480
Make sure to take care of yourself.

358
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,350
Don't worry.

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll be careful

360
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,790
in the upcoming matches.

361
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,850
I know that only by becoming
the Wolf Lord

362
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,640
can I support Yi

363
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,590
and even exchange military power

364
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,640
for your freedom.

365
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,480
As long as you and your son are well,

366
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,200
I'll do anything.

go to Xixiang and find the caravan
that used to work with us

397
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,640
to secretly send another batch.

Do you really think
you're one of the Xi Clan?

402
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Isn't it you who cooperated
with me in this act

403
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
to help me get the black iron crystals?

404

Don't worry.

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,880
I've been very careful this time.

409
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,000
Where is Shao Qimin?

410
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,670
Shao Qimin?

411
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,350
The mine repairs are complete.

412
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,750
I sent him over there to keep watch

413
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,680
to prevent any mistakes.

414
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,720
He'll return
once the crystals are sent out.

415
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,870
What's wrong?

416
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,080
Help me out.

417
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,960
When he returns,

418
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,260
have him go find Qingkou at once.

419
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,880
This is very important to Qingkou.

420
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,000
Qingkou is not a bad child.

421
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,920
She just has trauma from her childhood.

422
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,880
When Qingkou was little,

423
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
she was kidnapped during an outing.

424
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,050
After she was rescued,
she had a high fever.

425
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,910
In her fury, the Queen Mother ordered

426
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,310
that all the guards and maids
who had served her

427
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,480
be executed.

428
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,200
Qingkou witnessed it all.

429
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,510
From then on, she stopped
getting close to anyone.

430
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,550
No wonder her personality is like this.

431
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,720
She's also a pitiful person.

432
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,960
Now, it seems she's become dependent
on Shao Qimin.

433
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,110
Once Qimin returns,

434
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,340
I'll have him go find Qingkou.

435
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,680
It seems we really fooled Xi Mo.

436
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,550
He's probably trying to figure out

437
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,290
how to get
his father's official seal now.

438
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,070
Xi Changkun is cunning and sly.

439
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,550
Xi Mo won't have an easy time.

440
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,300
He's in a hurry to show Xi Changkun
his achievements,

441
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,240
so this time he'll go all out.

442
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,750
By the way, how is Luo Qi?

443
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
He's fine. The arrow wound isn't fatal.

444
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
But you...

445
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Don't overwork yourself.

446
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,590
Come here.

447
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
Someone shot Luo Qi.

448
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,030
Xi Mo thought it was me.

449
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,270
Seeing how clueless he is,

450
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,030
I don't think the Xi Clan is behind it.

451
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,070
Among the Five Clans,
if it wasn't Xi Changkun,

452
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,240
could it be Su Yande?

453
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,160
Su Yande is just a brute.

454
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,980
He doesn't want the position
of Wolf Lord.

455
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,030
He's here for the resources

456
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,960
at this Hunting Event.

457
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Do you have another hidden opponent?

458
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,310
If what you said is true,

459
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,270
they must be well-prepared

460
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,920
for this Hunting Event.

461
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm curious

462
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,590
who besides Xi Changkun

463
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,750
is targeting me.

464
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,350
In any case,

465
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,350
Xi Mo will set a trap
in the woods tonight.

466
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,110
You must be careful.

467
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,910
My Lord,

468
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
I failed to complete the task.

469
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,610
I'm willing to be punished.

470
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,350
What happened?

471
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,240
The woods are full of animal traps.

472
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,390
I was foolish

473
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,210
and didn't spot them in time.

474
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
You were injured?

475
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes.

476
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm fine now, My Lord.

477
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,720
Thank you for your concern.

478
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,720
Go back.

479
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,110
Just look for another opportunity.

480
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,350
Yes.

481
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,130
Remember to treat your foot.

482
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,970
Don't let it get infected.

483
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
Thank you for your concern.

484
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,950
My Lord,

485
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,070
yesterday, Miss Qiluo gave Xi Mo an idea

486
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,410
to set a trap under the fallen leaves
in the woods.

487
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,310
You must be careful in tomorrow's match.

488
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,880
And that medicine...

489
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,870
Leave.

490
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,350
Yes.

491
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,670
Father.

492
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,030
What are you doing here?

493
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,590
I saw someone in your tent,

494
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,720
so I came to check.

495
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,790
I must've seen it wrong.

496
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,790
You should rest early.

497
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
You're indeed good at winning hearts.

498
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,270
In just a few days,

499
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,680
you've gained Xi Mo's trust

500
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
and had him at your mercy.

501
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,110
Compared to you,

502
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm not that good.

503
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,510
After all, the Princess of the Xi Clan

504
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,270
fell in love with you at first sight,

505
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,820
doing everything she could
to please you.

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
By the way, how's the sachet?

507
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,400
Is it useful?

508
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,280
Are you jealous?

509
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,310
You and I have no connection.

510
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,750
Why would I be jealous?

511
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm jealous.

512
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
I admit it. I'm jealous.

513
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,480
Have you considered

514
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,270
my request on the boat?

515
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,710
If I lose the Wolf Lord position,

516
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,070
I'll use military merits
to appeal to the King.

517
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,750
But when I think of you

518
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
and the danger you might face,

519
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,350

Qiluo really wants to side with us.

533
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,480
It's because of her

534
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590
that Luo Qi got shot

535
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,790
and Xuan Lie lost the first match.

536
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,350
And the trap set in the woods yesterday.

537
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
She joined us in front of everyone

538
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,020
and even offered strategies for me.

539

540

This woman is full of tricks.

541
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,350
Whether she's sincere or not,

542
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,590
it's not for you to decide.

543
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,270

My Lord, what can I do for you?

545

546
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,400
You've been working for us.

547
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,290
I should've thanked you properly
long ago.

548
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,240
For the upcoming matches,

549
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,950
you'll need to put in even more effort.

550
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm just offering a small bit of help.

551
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,470
The key to victory is

552
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,850
the unity between you and your son.

553
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,240
We can't be sure if we can win.

554
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,920
But there's something
more important than this.

555
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
If you can do this,

556
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,750
I'll certainly thank you properly.

557
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,830
Since you've pledged allegiance
to our clan,

558
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,720
why not help me kill Xuan Lie?

559
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,070
Xuan Lie destroyed your caravan
in the Uncontrollable.

560
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,480
It's only right

561
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
you kill him

562
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,880
and avenge your caravan.

563
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,790
But I'm just a merchant

564
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,610
without power or influence.

565
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,510
I can't hurt him in the slightest.

566
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,640
Don't worry, Miss Jun.

567
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,270
I'll help you.

568
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
This is called Nameless.

569
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,160
It's the most potent poison in Beixuan.

570
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
There is no cure.

571
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,440
I'll be more than happy

572
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,030
to kill Xuan Lie.

573
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,510
But if Xuan Lie dies from poison,

574
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,680
you'll be the prime suspect

575
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,790
of the King of Beixuan.

576
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,880
This crime might implicate
your entire clan.

577
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,680
I can't involve you

578
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
in such a huge trouble at this time.

579
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,590
Miss Jun, you don't need to worry.

580
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,550
I've made thorough plans.

581
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,640
Since you've planned everything,

582
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,510
I'll find a chance to do it today.

583
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,960
No need to wait for a chance.

584
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,590
Today, I've arranged
for Xuan Lie to come.

585
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,750
You only need

586
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,590
to serve him this wine.

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Young Master,
the Xi Leader invites you to his tent.

588
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,780
The Xi and Xuan
have always been at odds.

589
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,000
He must have ill intentions

590
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
behind this invitation.

591
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,110
Young Master,

592
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,240
I'll go with you.

593
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,750
Rest well.

594
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,200
Xi Changkun must be doing this

595
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,750
because of Qiluo.

596
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,640
Perfect time for me to take things back.

597
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,680
Once Xuan Lie is dead,

598
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,750
the position of Wolf Lord will be mine.

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,640
Then all of Beixuan will be ours.

600
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,640
Then you can have as many stones

601
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,830
as you want.

602
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,480
That sounds great.

603
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Let's proceed according to your plan.

604
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,590
General Lie is here.

605
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,480
General Lie.

606
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,100
Mr. Xi, what do you want from me?

607
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,910
Please sit.

608
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,640
You've long desired
the black iron crystal mine.

609
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,070
I invited you today

610
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,880
to discuss this.

611
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,240
What makes you change your mind

612
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,640
and decide to transfer the mine to me?

613
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,400
General Lie, don't rush.

614
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,400
Fill the general's wine first.

615
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,080
General Lie.

616
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,720
Please drink it.

617
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,920
Can I understand this

618
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
as that by drinking this,

619
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,160
there will be no further ties
between us?

620
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,000
Even if you don't drink it,

621
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,640
we can never go back to how we were.

622
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,830
So whether I drink it or not

623
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,790
doesn't matter at all.

624
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,640
If you insist on this

625
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,880
being a drink to sever ties,

626
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,680
then so be it.

627
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,430
Father,

628
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,350
this woman is full of tricks.

629
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,590
You can't give her the crystals.

630
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,750
Xiu, I told you not to meddle.

631
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,890
What are you two doing here?

632
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,240
- Leave.
- Let's go.

633
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
I know you came to our clan

634
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,590
for the black iron crystals.

635
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,880
But let me be honest.

636
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,200
The black iron crystals mine

637
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,880
is no longer ours.

638
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,440
How could the mine
no longer belong to us?

639
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,450
Father,

640
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,310
this transfer document

641
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,720
carries your private seal.

642
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,270
So now, the mine

643
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,920
belongs to General Lie.

644
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,310
I've seen through your little scheme.

645
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,360
A business transfer
needs my official seal.

646
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,600
A commercial seal is of no use.

647
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
This transfer document

648
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,480
is nothing but waste paper.

649
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,640
Luckily, I went back to the Annexe.

650
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,510
What did you say?

651
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,000
I've done business with you before.

652
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,590
Last night, I hastened back

653
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,030
to the Annexe in the Royal City.

654
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,200
It took me a lot of effort.

655
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,030
Father, you hid
your official seal...

656
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,110
Shut up.

657
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,750
Mr. Xi, don't worry.

658
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,710
My family has offered a generous profit.

659
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,240
This is beneficial to both sides.

660
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,700
General Lie,

661
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,550
I didn't know the private seal
was useless.

662
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,350
Since I've broken my word to you,

663
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,920
then I'll drink this wine

664
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,880
on your behalf.

665
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,030
General Lie.

666
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,800
Xuan Lie, what are you doing?

667
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,230
Mr. Xi wanted to poison me first.

668
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,510
Mr. Xi,

669
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,800
any explanations?

670
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,770
It was me who poisoned you.

671
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,750
It has nothing to do with Mr. Xi.

672
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,190
Yes, it was her idea.

673
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,540
It has nothing to do with Father.

674
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,590
I called you here
to discuss the mine issue.

675
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,480
General Lie,

676
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,550
for the harmony of the Five Clans,

677
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,880
you should not point a knife at me.

678
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,630
Your son couldn't resist
the beauty's scheme

679
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,460
and started doing business
with the Juns.

680
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,880
We can discuss the mine another day.

681
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,880
Mr. Xi, I hope you'll come next time
with sincerity.

682
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,020
(Xi)

683
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
- General Lie.
- Guards.

684
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

685
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,630
Take the Princess back to the tent.

686
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,710
She's not allowed to leave

687
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,070
without my permission.

688
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,000
- Yes.
- Father.

689
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,680
Father.

690
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,710
Young Master.

691
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,060
(Xi)
Give the token to Woshan.

692
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,380
Tell him to visit the Xi Annexe.

693
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,390
Yes.

694
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,360
This plan indeed wasn't perfect.

695
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,000
I didn't expect Xiu to come.

696
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,480
Earlier, you said to the general
that you two could return to the past

697
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,510
whether he accepted the wine or not.

698
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,030
It seems like you were

699
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,960
reminding Xuan Lie that this wine

700
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,000
should not be drunk.

701
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,320
Mr. Xi, stop playing dumb.

702
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,590
Everyone knows that the Xi and Xuan

703
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,980
have been competing for years,

704
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,320
and now you're at a standstill
over the mine.

705
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,070
But you suddenly invited Xuan Lie
to your tent.

706
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
It's hard for him not to be suspicious.

707
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,960
So, whether that wine
was poisoned or not,

708
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,580
Xuan Lie wouldn't have accepted it.

709
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
Your intention

710
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,710
was simply to test me

711
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,710
to see if I'd hand him the drink.

712
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,070
You really enjoy
studying people's hearts.

713
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
Mr. Xi,

714
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
do you think my performance today

715
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,760
can convince you

716
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,440
that I am truly loyal?

717
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
Father,

718
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,190
there's plenty of time ahead.

719
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,360
Miss Qiluo has helped me several times.

720
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,670
She's proven her sincerity.

721
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,200
Please don't doubt her anymore.

722
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,440
Mo is right.

723
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,770
There's plenty of time ahead.

724
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,110
We'll still have the chance
to kill Xuan Lie.

725
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,740
(Jun Mansion)

726
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,000
The Chancellor is here.

727
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,510
Chancellor, this way.

728
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,660
- Greetings.
- Greetings, Chancellor.

729
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,440
What happened to him?

730
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,760
What did the physician say?

731
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,670
Several physicians came.

732
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,320
They all said it was serious.

733
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
It seems his legs...

734
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
Zheng Yuan.

735
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,720
Uncle Ling.

736
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,320
Let him use
this century-old blood ginseng.

737
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,760
It should be helpful.

738
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,510
If you need anything from me,

739
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,190
just tell me. Don't hold back.

740
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,190
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Chancellor.

741
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,130
Thank you, Chancellor.

742
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,480
Take good care of him.

743
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,720
Yes.

744
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,960
Does your father enjoy

745
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,150
playing the flute?

746
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,670
This is Feifan's flute.

747
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,760
This mark is rather unique.

748
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
Which store did this?

749
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,670
Feifan made this
purple copper flute himself.

750
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,070
He likes to engrave this mark

751
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,230
on his personal items.

752
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
Not bad.

753
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm leaving now.

754
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,740
(Crossbow Diagram)

755
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,710
Is Jun Feifan

756
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,150
the Baigong's heir?

757
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,510
Zheng Yuan.

758
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,510
My Lord.

759
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,510
Any news from the spies

760
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,070
we sent to find Jun Feifan?

761
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,710
As you weren't truly looking
for him for the Juns,

762
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,440
those spies have withdrawn back.

763
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,030
Send them again.

764
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,000
Make sure to find Jun Feifan.

765
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,760
No matter if he's alive or dead.

766
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,030
You finally came.

767
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,880
Do you still remember me
after over a decade?

768
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,920
Mr. Chengsong.

769
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,230
I raised Miss Qiluo
when she was little.

770
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,730
I've been with Miss Yunyi
of the Liu family

771
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,800
for decades.

772
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,190
Time really flies.

773
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
In the blink of an eye, I'm old now.

774
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,480
Look, you haven't changed at all.

775
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
Come on.

776
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,400
Qian City really nurtures its people.

777
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,240
You're so young.

778
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,990
Have a seat.

779
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,800
Why did you bring me here?

780
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,190
Why did you kidnap my youngest son?

781
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,710
Where have you taken him?

782
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,680
Nanny,

783
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,030
what are you talking about?

784
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,230
I only invited your son
to the countryside

785
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
to play for a few days.

786
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,150
As long as you return safely,

787
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,480
you'll naturally see him again.

788
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,960
Then, how can I return safely?

789
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
Nanny,

790
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,320
you just sit down

791
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,000
and stay calm.

792
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,280
Just answer a few questions truthfully.

793
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,510
Today, we won't ask about Jun Qiluo.

794
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,360
We'll ask about Jun Feifan.

795
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,320
