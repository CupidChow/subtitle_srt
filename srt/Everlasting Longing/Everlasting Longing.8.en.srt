Roll it.

19
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,700
Sir,

20
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
it's almost done.

21
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,140
Let's check it out.

22
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,980
All right.

23
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,860
Behind the mine is a hot spring.

24
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
The water's warm.

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,270
Perhaps it's what you seek.

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,670
He.

27
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,550
When He works,

28
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,950
it's like he's deaf to everything.

29
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,910
Young Master,

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,270
since you're here,

31
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,580
why don't we do an inspection?

32
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,230
General,

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,110
I shouldn't interfere.

34
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,110
May I take a walk around?

35
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,460
Be careful.

36
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,070
Young Master.

37
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,350
Get back to work.

38
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,740
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,790
Let's go.

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,140
Young Master,

41
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,510
when did you arrive?

42
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,550
Come on, He,

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,700
we came a while ago.

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,860
I've been calling you,

45
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,830
but you didn't respond.

46
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,670
How did the survey go?

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,070
Young Master,

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,740
these are sample stones from the surface.

49
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,470
The surveys show

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,900
we avoid the springs below.

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,950
Now, we must check

52
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,420
if there are any explosives.

53
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,580
If not,

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,770
we can start mining soon.

55
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,790
It's indeed of high quality.

56
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,950
Why did you take a lady here?

57
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,230
She seems quite interested in the ore.

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
Found it.

59
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,110
Found what?

60
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,270
Weren't you looking for a hot spring?

61
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,620
I was.

62
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,110
But unexpectedly,

63
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,030
this is more intriguing.

64
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,230
It's my first time seeing

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,620
ore of such quality.

66
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,710
It might be more profitable

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,940
than fragrant stones.

68
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,060
I never expected

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,590
it was such a great find today.

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,470
The black iron crystal is rare,

71
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,230
but it has no fragrance.

72
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,230
Perhaps it's not as profitable

73
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,990
as the fragrant stone.

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,260
You have a point.

75
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,060
May I

76
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,110
take it back for a closer look?

77
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,380
If it's not as profitable,

78
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,590
I'll return it to you.

79
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,300
But if it's more profitable,

80
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,620
we might need to change our contract goods.

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,260
General, do you agree?

82
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,940
Of course.

83
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,470
But you reminded me in Liangzhou

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,910
that such a hard stone

85
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,030
has many uses.

86
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,430
Luo Qi.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,460
Young Master.

88
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,300
Let's see how hard this stone is.

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,220
Yes.

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,380
It's harder than my knife.

91
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,340
My blade is destroyed.

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,990
It was just a name until now.

93
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,150
Have you heard of it?

94
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,710
We're in the jewelry business,

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,420
so we pay special attention to gems.

96
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,820
I've heard before

97
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,110
the north is rich in sturdy ores.

98
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,590
Like I said, Miss Jun,

99
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,650
reading enlightens you,

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
but travel broadens the mind.

101
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,030
You should've visited Beixuan earlier.

102
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,940
You're right.

103
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,940
Sir, a royal decree's been issued,

104
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,130
summoning you to the Palace.

105
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,630
He?

106
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,990
How come you look thinner?

107
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,260
Miss,

108
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,710
have we met?

109
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,740
When we met before,

110
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,150
I was dressed as a man.

111
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,030
I am that

112
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
Mr. Qi.

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,150
Do you remember me?

114
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,590
Miss Jun, you've made a mistake.

115
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,910
He's not He Jiyao.

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,590
He's He Woshan, his elder twin,

117
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,910
an expert in geological survey.

118
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,150
I see.

119
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,550
I apologize.

120
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,860
Please forgive me, Mr. He.

121
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,870
It's all right.

122
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,420
No worries, Miss.

123
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,710
I must go now.

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,990
Once you find water,

125
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,350
Woshan will send you back.

126
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,670
The crystal...

127
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,780
You can take it.

128
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,990
Thank you.

129
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,380
To Woshan, she's a woman,

130
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,150
but a man to his brother.

131
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,740
In their minds,

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,740
Miss Jun is indistinguishable.

133
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,350
Interesting.

134
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
My Lady,

135
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,230
had I known you wanted me to get the loom

136
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,670
just to teach me how to weave,

137
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,180
I should've refused.

138
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,300
My intention in doing so

139
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
is for you

140
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,910
to support yourself in the future.

141
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,620
You can't be a maid forever.

142
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,030
I'm willing to serve you forever.

143
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,340
My Lady,

144
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,230
you've been staring at it.

145
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,990
What is this thing?

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

147
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,700
As you were.

148
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,910
Sit.

149
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,100
General Lie,

150
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,590
how have you been?

151
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,430
Mr. Xi,

152
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,110
it's been a while.

153
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,780
I summoned Xi to the Royal City

154
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,950
to discuss the black iron

155
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,900
crystal mine.

156
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,230
It's a precious material.

157
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,950
If used properly,

158
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,070
it'll benefit Beixuan for a century.

159
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,230
Mr. Xi is experienced and respected.

160
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,860
I'm sure he can maximize its use.

161
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,220
It originates from Central Town.

162
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,740
Lie, you must cooperate with Mr. Xi.

163
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,620
As it benefits the people,

164
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,830
I'm sure you'll fully support it.

165
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,830
Your Majesty,

166
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,660
according to the surveys,

167
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,740
there are explosives in the mine.

168
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,730
So, I believe

169
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,540
the explosion risk is high.

170
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,020
It's better to eliminate the risk

171
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,270
before Mr. Xi takes over.

172
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,900
You're always thoughtful.

173
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,310
What do you say, Mr. Xi?

174
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,590
The general is meticulous.

175
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,660
I'll send more people

176
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,740
to work with Xuan Clan.

177
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,430
But Mr. He prefers

178
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,590
to work alone,

179
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,740
and you're busy with the Hunting Event.

180
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,310
I wonder who will handle it

181
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,540
with my people.

182
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,660
We'll have it arranged.

183
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,590
No need to worry.

184
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,260
I was overthinking.

185
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,830
You keep fine company.

186
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,470
Even the woman from Yannan

187
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,660
helped open the trade route

188
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,990
between Liangzhou and Yannan on her own.

189
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,380
She's a truly hidden gem.

190
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,470
Lie has reported it earlier.

191
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,590
Though she's from Yannan,

192
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,070
the trade between the two cities

193
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,620
indeed benefits our people.

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,860
Lie knows what he's doing.

195
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,910
Your Majesty.

196
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,070
All right.

197
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,740
Queen Mother hosts a banquet for you.

198
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,430
Mr. Xi, you may go prepare.

199
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,950
As you command.

200
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,380
Father.

201
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,580
Father,

202
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,190
I saw Xuan Lie going in earlier.

203
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,740
Why did the King summon you?

204
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,130
The King granted the mine

205
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,070
to our clan.

206
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,990
That's good news.

207
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,350
With the mine,

208
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,230
our clan can gain more.

209
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,740
Is that the priority?

210
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,380
No, Father.

211
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,950
The priority is to

212
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,990
stop Xuan Lie from joining the Hunting Event.

213
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
The mine is in the blasting phase.

214
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,230
Send someone to inspect it.

215
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,860
Remember, keep a low profile.

216
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,070
Father, rest assured.

217
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,990
I know what to do.

218
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,110
Act swiftly.

219
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,740
Leave no trace behind.

220
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,580
Understood.

221
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,710
After the woman from Yannan

222
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,490
opened the trade route, why haven't you

223
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,150
reported on the follow-up?

224
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,180
Your Majesty,

225
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,030
it was meant to help

226
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,710
Sun Clan's displaced people.

227
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,310
If mentioned deliberately,

228
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,730
it might seem like seeking credit.

229
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,710
Considering the time,

230
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,970
the caravan hasn't returned yet.

231
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,230
It's uncertain if the trade went well.

232
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,350
I didn't dare report early.

233
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,430
You are always thorough.

234
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,650
But since Xi criticized you,

235
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,740
other clans might do the same.

236
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,140
I don't want you risking yourself

237
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,780
for a Yannan woman.

238
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,950
I understand.

239
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,860
I gave the mine to the Xi Clan,

240
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,590
and it seems you have concerns.

241
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,590
Do you have other thoughts?

242
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,950
I wouldn't dare.

243
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,950
But I visited the mine today

244
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,540
and saw the black iron crystal.

245
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,950
It's beyond ordinary gems.

246
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,430
It's a rare treasure

247
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,310
for our people.

248
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,740
But I granted it to him.

249
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,310
I cannot go back on my word.

250
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,720
But located in Central Town, your clan

251
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,070
has massive resources.

252
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,230
More mines will be found.

253
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,740
As the head of your clan,

254
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,900
you must prioritize the greater good.

255
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,550
I understand.

256
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,710
(It's not enough.)

257
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,190
My Lady,

258
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,950
is this the ore you mentioned

259
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,500
that can make the loom operate faster?

260
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,380
I'm not sure yet.

261
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,380
You're skilled and strong,

262
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,500
so why were you sold as a slave?

263
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,670
He Jiyao?

264
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,580
Greetings, Princess.

265
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,620
Why are you alone?

266
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,460
Where is Lie?

267
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,660
He returned to the Palace

268
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,110
and sent me to find you.

269
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,240
Her Majesty is worried about you.

270
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,070
Please return with me.

271
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,990
Lie didn't come to find me himself.

272
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,750
How did you find me?

273
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,140
I heard from the people

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,780
they saw you at the Border Stockade.

275
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,020
So I came here.

276
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,260
He Jiyao is Lie's deputy general.

277
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,780
Lie should be waiting in Royal City.

278
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,620
Princess,

279
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,990
this is...

280
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
He's my slave.

281
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,230
I'm taking him back.

282
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,470
That's inappropriate.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,070
His identity is unknown.

284
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,470
What if he has ill intentions?

285
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,500
I insist

286
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,470
on taking him back.

287
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,260
Come on. I'll show you my palace.

288
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,070
Princess,

289
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,980
the flask is...

290
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,620
Princess?

291
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,740
Princess?

292
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,670
Princess?

293
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,140
Princess?

294
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,270
Who are you?

295
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,470
What do you want?

296
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,470
You robbed us at the casino

297
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,620
a few days ago.

298
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,540
Now, you've forgotten us?

299
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,500
How dare you

300
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,740
abduct me?

301
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,710
Enough talk.

302
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,990
That skilled one isn't here.

303
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,620
Just give us the money.

304
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,590
Or we'll end you.

305
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,430
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

306
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,280
- The money.
- Now!

307
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,430
- Now!
- Hurry up!

308
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,710
- Quickly.
- Pay up.

309
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,070
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

310
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,190
Pay up now.

311
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,470
Give us the money!

312
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,900
Hurry.

313
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,620
- Where is it?
- I told you...

314
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,910
Get lost.

315
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Go, go, go.

316
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,990
It's okay. I'm here for you.

317
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,260
(Turns out not just Lie)

318
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,780
(could save me.)

319
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,430
Sorry for being late.

320
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,500
Are you hurt?

321
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,270
I'm fine.

322
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,630
Who abducted her?

323
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,160
They're from the Uncontrollable.

324
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,820
I had a conflict with them.

325
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,750
Princess,

326
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,190
we'll reach the Royal City soon.

327
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,300
His identity is uncertain,

328
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,870
and he brings danger.

329
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,630
It's not wise to take him along.

330
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,100
He saved my life.

331
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,500
He must stay with me.

332
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Princess.

333
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,260
But such a profitable slave

334
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,020
might be coveted by others.

335
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,870
I must let them know

336
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,670
who your master is.

337
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,470
After leaving the forest,

338
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,820
let's find a place to rest.

339
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,660
(Xuan Mansion)

340
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,510
Young Master,

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,580
why insist on obtaining the crystal?

342
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,610
Earlier today, you said,

343
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,190
to He Jiyao and He Woshan,

344
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,430
Miss Jun is indistinguishable.

345
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,950
Since none of us

346
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,230
has met Jun Feifan,

347
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,300
it's unclear if Jun is male or female.

348
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,940
Do you mean

349
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,630
Jun Feifan is female?

350
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,830
When we intercepted Jun Feifan

351
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,020
in the Uncontrollable,

352
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,470
she was dressed as a man.

353
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,260
The servant
called her Young Master.

354
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,510
But...

355
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,020
Didn't Miss Jun say

356
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,630
Jun Feifan went out for gems,

357
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,470
and she disguised to trade?

358
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,230
Jun's eldest daughter's
recovering in Qian City.

359
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,910
Does she look unwell?

360
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,710
She's been ill for twenty years

361
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,990
and bears no trace of it?

362
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,990
Five years in trade, yet such bravery.

363
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,670
Either she's talented

364
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,990
or has lots of experience.

365
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,100
So, you're saying

366
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,470
Miss Jun is Jun Feifan?

367
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,230
But it doesn't seem right.

368
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,710
Jun Feifan is a renowned figure.

369
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,390
He's well-known in Yannan.

370
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,910
If he were truly a woman,

371
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,260
how could he deceive everyone?

372
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,580
In any case,

373
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,540
we can't overlook any possibility.

374
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,740
Young Master,

375
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,540
even if Miss Jun is Jun Feifan,

376
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,540
how does this relate to the crystal?

377
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,910
Starting from Yao City,

378
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,990
even in Liangzhou,

379
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,300
she is intrigued by every black raw stone.

380
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,710
I had Woshan investigate

381
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,710
the use of black iron crystal

382
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,830
and whether it can be used
to forge weapons.

383
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,670
Her visit to Beixuan

384
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,150
must be for the crystal.

385
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,780
It makes sense.

386
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,740
Miss Jun seems suspicious.

387
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,910
Perhaps it could confirm

388
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,020
her identity as Baigong's heir.

389
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,300
If that's the case,

390
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,670
you'd uncover
the truth of the incident

391
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,630
and avenge your parents.

392
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,020
It's just my speculation.

393
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,260
The crystal appeared by chance.

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,870
She was unaware of it before.

395
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,950
I tested her today.

396
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,430
Her behavior is flawless.

397
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,830
Young Master,

398
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,780
do you wish her to be Jun Feifan

399
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,500
or Jun Qiluo?

400
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,270
General.

401
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,180
Dongyin?

402
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,500
What is this?

403
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,060
Deputy Luo,

404
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,870
it's a soup for the lady.

405
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,430
When she returns,

406
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,480
she can have it to warm up.

407
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,310
She went out?

408
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,030
Where did she go?

409
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,190
She didn't say.

410
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,310
You may leave now.

411
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,550
Yes.

412
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,260
Luo Qi, go find her.

413
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,380
Young Master,

414
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,910
Miss Jun might have just

415
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,870
gone for a walk. Why...

416
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,300
I suspect she's gone to the mine.

417
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,910
It's likely for the crystal.

418
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,100
Let's go.

419
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,140
Yes.

420
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,740
Miss Jun?

421
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,830
Wait for me.

422
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
Young Master.

423
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,470
You've been with me for long.

424
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,230
I still don't know your name.

425
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,230
Shao Qimin.

426
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,100
How about Qingming?

427
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,150
Now you're here,

428
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,430
it's better to have a Beixuan name.

429
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,260
So be it.

430
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,460
(Qinghua Token)

431
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,170
Don't move.

432
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,770
If I lose my grip,

433
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,670
you might get hurt.

434
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,260
Without Beixuan's travel pass,

435
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,390
it might cause trouble.

436
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,580
This Qinghua Token

437
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,100
proves you're with me.

438
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,500
No one will trouble you.

439
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,710
Don't.

440
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,780
If you give it to him,

441
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,470
what if he harbors ill intentions?

442
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm afraid...

443
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,380
Qingming,

444
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,820
would you kill me?

445
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,900
(Qingming)

446
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,510
Don't worry.

447
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,580
I won't harm you.

448
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,550
Did you hear that?

449
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,190
Qingming said he won't kill me.

450
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,740
He Jiyao, you should leave.

451
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,300
Qingming's quite good.

452
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,390
He can protect me.

453
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,060
All right. I trust you.

454
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,900
(My Lady,)

455
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,340
(where are you?)

456
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,230
General,

457
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,390
why are you here?

458
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,390
Don't come closer.

459
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,950
I just brought you a garment.

460
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,390
How can you
assume my intentions?

461
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,390
If you want to enjoy the hot spring,

462
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,990
there's one within my mansion.

463
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,430
Why did you come here?

464
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,670
That's not a natural hot spring.

465
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
And also,

466
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,190
I want some privacy when I bathe.

467
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,420
General,

468
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,100
what are you doing?

469
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,540
After so many years of ailing,

470
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,340
you're still weak.

471
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,820
The hot spring's not for lingering.

472
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,540
I've recovered.

473
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,100
Thank you anyway.

474
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,990
I overestimated myself.

475
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,990
I shouldn't have stayed this long.

476
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,740
I'm feeling dizzy now.

477
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,230
Could you please

478
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,470
take me back?

479
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,100
Young Master,

480
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,710
I've searched,

481
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,340
but couldn't find Miss Jun.

482
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,510
Go outside.

483
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,470
All right.

484
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,950
I'll wait outside.

485
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,060
So you were worried

486
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,430
and came to look for me?

487
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,230
Since you're unwell,

488
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,300
don't stay here.

489
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,780
I'll wait for you outside.

490
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,990
Dress up

491
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,430
and we'll return.

492
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,230
Young Master,

493
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,740
why are you alone?

494
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Uh...

495
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,230
Where is Miss Jun?

496
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,790
Woshan,

497
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,680
any progress

498
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,150
on what I asked you to investigate?

499
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,870
Young Master, I've checked.

500
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,230
Black iron is dense but light,

501
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,230
and it resists rust.

502
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,870
It's ideal for crafting weapons.

503
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,100
However, it's rare and hard to mine.

504
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,060
No documents show this type of stone

505
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,820
being used to make weapons.

506
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,150
(Could it be that I'm overthinking?)

507
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,710
You may leave.

508
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Yes, sir.

509
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,740
Come on.

510
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,470
Let's go.

511
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,620
(Xuan Mansion)

512
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,710
It's...

513
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,780
I'm teaching Dongyin some skills.

514
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,190
The embroidery's crowded,

515
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,670
so we practice here at night.

516
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,780
You've only known her a few days,

517
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,670
yet you treat her sincerely.

518
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,230
She must've taken good care of you.

519
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,210
My Lady,

520
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,910
I reheated the soup several times.

521
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,020
Have it while it's hot.

522
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,270
General,

523
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,580
please have some too.

524
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,790
I'll pass.

525
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,630
It's late. I have to go.

526
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,300
The mine opens tomorrow.

527
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,430
We can bring some back
for polishing.

528
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
Would you like to go?

529
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,230
Of course.

530
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,340
I have to fulfill our contract.

531
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,270
General,

532
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,230
one more thing.

533
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,950
I went to the market
for textiles the other day

534
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,670
and saw someone
with this totem on the wrist.

535
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,060
It seemed familiar
but I didn't think much.

536
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,430
Then I remembered,

537
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,700
when we were in Liangzhou,

538
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,870
you showed me the totem.

539
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,340
So, I drew it.

540
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,910
You saw it in Royal City?

541
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,950
Do you know where that person went?

542
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,950
I was headed in a different direction,

543
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,100
so I didn't pay attention.

544
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,670
This totem is very important to me.

545
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,390
Thank you for remembering it.

546
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Have some rest.

547
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,870
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

548
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,580
Your Majesty,

549
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,190
Yu has been looking forward

550
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,390
to riding at the Hunting Event.

551
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,500
Yu is so brave.

552
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,190
He'll be a great general.

553
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,630
I will become

554
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,340
a hero like General Lie.

555
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,190
Good.

556
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,670
Yu dreams of going to the battlefield

557
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,260
and fighting for you.

558
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,910
You should teach him well.

559
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,260
Don't be nervous.

560
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,020
Just do as you usually do.

561
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,680
Bring them.

562
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,940
Your Majesty,

563
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,150
these are two fine steeds
chosen by the rider.

564
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,780
The two princes may choose freely.

565
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,740
All right. Go ahead.

566
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,180
Go.

567
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,820
Did Mother say flower or cloud?

568
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,500
Take the two princes for a round

569
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,180
to show the rider.

570
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,270
Watch how fast I am.

571
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,990
Yu practiced without guidance.

572
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,270
He is so fast

573
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,020
yet so fearless.

574
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,270
Yu resembles the King in his youth.

575
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,310
- Yu!
- Help!

576
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,350
Help!

577
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,200
Yu!

578
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,040
Help!

579
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,540
- What's going on?
- Help!

580
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,150
Yu.

581
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,470
Are you all right?

582
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,310
Yu!

583
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,220
- Mother, I'm scared.
- Let me see.

584
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Are you hurt?

585
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,660
Take him to the imperial physician.

586
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,430
Go.

587
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,140
How could a fine steed be startled?

588
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,980
Yi.

589
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,900
Mother.

590
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,420
- Are you all right?
- Zhizhou.

591
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,060
Investigate it thoroughly.

592
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,470
I need you to

593
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,750
get to the bottom of this.

594
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,030
As you command.

595
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,020
(Whispers of Fragrance and Shadows)

596
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,060
How is the task

597
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,900
from yesterday?

598
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,910
Young Master, the totem is set.

599
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,540
The grinding machine
is sent there.

600
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,350
I don't understand.

601
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,140
The totem is for capturing people,

602
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,830
but why transport

603
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,840
the grinding machine?

604
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,690
Moreover,

605
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,210
you had He Woshan work overnight

606
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,140
just to refine a few

607
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,540
crystal stones?

608
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,700
Yesterday, she told me
about the totem

609
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,950
to reach the mine before me.

610
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,790
Keep an eye on her.

611
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,830
Report to me if she leaves.

612
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,900
Understood.

613
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140
(Changsheng Pharmacy)

614
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,580
(Changsheng Pharmacy)

615
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,460
Young Master.

616
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,020
Young Master.

617
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,470
Miss Jun

618
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,470
went to the mine.

619
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,670
Keep an eye on him

620
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,870
and don't alert him.

621
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

622
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,790
To the mine.

623
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,660
Yes.

624
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
Come with me.

625
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,500
- It's packed.
- Why not wait for me?

626
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,350
I heard you left early this morning.

627
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,990
I thought it was urgent.

628
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,950
So, I came first.

629
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,470
Do you know what this is?

630
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,670
A grinding machine.

631
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,660
We use it in the jewelry store.

632
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,180
Seems the crystals are hard to polish.

633
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,970
Considering the cost of labor and time,

634
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,660
it's not more profitable

635
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,500
than fragrant stone.

636
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,020
We should cancel our deal

637
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,960
on black iron crystals.

638
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,330
I'll send someone
to find fragrant stones for you.

639
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,140
It's not that the crystals
are hard to grind.

640
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,830
The crystal and grinding machine

641
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,750
are like a loom and silk.

642
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,020
If the loom doesn't work well,

643
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,540
how can you blame the silk?

644
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,430
Mold the crystal into this shape

645
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,060
and try using it as an axle.

646
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,830
How did you think of

647
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
using it for the axle?

648
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,470
Show me around inside,

649
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,430
and I'll tell you.

650
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,670
Go ahead.

651
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,350
Yesterday, when I was polishing

652
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,750
the black iron crystal,

653
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,120
I found that upon heating,

654
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,620
it melted into a harder, smoother material.

655
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,700
Do you remember I mentioned

656
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,680
Yannan's loom works better?

657
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,500
That's because our components

658
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,930
are crafted with more precision.

659
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,350
But how did you know

660
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,180
it can be used for axles?

661
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,750
Or did you always know?

662
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,620
Yesterday, I taught Dongyin to weave,

663
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
and she learned slowly.

664
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,350
We both felt drowsy.

665
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,990
So I lost my grip

666
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,100
and dropped the crystal into the fire.

667
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,500
That's how you found out?

668
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,830
I see the crystal

669
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,620
as a gift from you.

670
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,950
I must cherish it.

671
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,060
So I poured cold water on it.

672
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,310
When I took it out,

673
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,540
it was half melted.

674
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,350
Unexpectedly,

675
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,500
it became harder and smoother.

676
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,170
I think it's perfect
for making axles,

677
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,350
so I gave it a try.

678
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,180
I didn't expect it to be like this.

679
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,830
I've heard it can also
be made into armor,

680
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,890
but I never knew how to do it.

681
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,500
After hearing that, I had some clues.

682
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,790
Making it into armor

683
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,540
might be difficult.

684
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,220
It could take years even decades.

685
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,090
General,

686
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,750
how about starting to trade with the Juns

687
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,470
and transporting
the crystals to Yannan?

688
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,350
Once you make profits,

689
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,930
we can think of other uses for it.

690
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,700
You're full of lies.

691
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,470
Yesterday at the pavilion,

692
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,100
I thought we shared everything

693
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,140
and spoke openly.

694
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,620
Turns out I was being naive.

695
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,830
You're not just Jun Qiluo,
Jun's eldest daughter,

696
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,540
but also the person
I've been searching for...

697
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,540
Jun Feifan.

698
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,060
