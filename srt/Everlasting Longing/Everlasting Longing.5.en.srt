Aren't you afraid?

18
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,990
Human trafficking is a grave sin,

19
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,110
incriminating the clan.

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,620
You only kill bad guys.

21
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,790
I'm not one of them.

22
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Though this place lacks governance,

23
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,390
one still takes responsibility
for killing.

What troubles you, Your Highness?

26
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,180
General Lie. Mr. Luo.

27
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,020
I'm thinking about your words yesterday.

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,880
If I am to become a qualified Leader,

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,700
I must care about the Liangzhou people

30
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,060
and solve their concerns.

31
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,740
Upon thinking about it,

32
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,820
I still can't come up with any solution.

33
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,100
To teach someone to fish

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,020
is better than to give him a fish.

35
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,980
Providing jobs is the fundamental way.

36
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,380
(Bright Future)
But Liangzhou is poor.

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,580
Most people rely on farming or hunting.

38
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,900
I truly can't think of

39
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,820
any jobs to offer them.

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,260
Nanny Zhang got this sachet

41
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,660
from Yannan for you.

42
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,140
Thank you.

43
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,180
She knows I love sachets,

44
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,460
so she always looks out for them.

45
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,100
What's special about it?

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,140
Why do you like it so much?

47
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,780
You may not know

48
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,220
that sachets from Yannan

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,700
have a unique fragrance,

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,900
and the embroidery is exquisite.

51
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,660
It's not available in Beixuan.

52
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
If we could produce such items,

53
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,260
what's their market prospect in Beixuan?

54
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,540
If the cost is low,

55
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,780
with such delicate embroidery,

56
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,620
they'll become a hit.

57
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,700
Do you know the Jun family?

58
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,100
It has the greatest market share
in Yannan.

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,180
Whether in textiles or embroidery,

60
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,260
it is top-notch.

61
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,820
The embroidery on your sachet

62
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,420
is no match for the Juns.

63
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,620
This family is truly remarkable.

64
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,860
Qi Luo is from that family.

65
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,460
You mean

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,980
Qi knows the embroidery skill
of the Juns?

67
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
Thank you.

68
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
Zhaomin, what are you doing?

69
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,820
I heard it's your first time in Beixuan.

70
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,980
So I ordered
Beixuan's delicacies and wine

71
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
for you.

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,460
Here, this is weasel meat.

73
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
It is juicy, crispy, and delicious.

74
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,420
See if you like it.

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,020
You don't like it?

76
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,660
Then try this wild duck.

77
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,940
It's also tasty.

78
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Sorry, Zhaomin.

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,100
I prefer mild flavors.

80
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm not used to these.

81
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,180
It's okay.

82
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,020
Never mind.

83
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,820
Then try our special Milk Porridge.

84
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,420
It's mild and delicious.

85
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,580
Here you go.

86
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,220
Zhaomin.

87
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,340
What do you want from me?

88
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,540
You knew it.

89
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,220
As you know,

90
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,540
Liangzhou is short on water.

91
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,660
It hasn't rained for the whole autumn.

92
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,420
The fields yield nothing.

93
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,740
There are more refugees.

94
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,340
Mr. Xi is helping with food.

95
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,100
But it's only a temporary fix.

96
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,100
Teaching to fish
is better than giving fish.

97
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
Exactly!

98
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,940
You said the same as General Lie.

99
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,620
What else did he say?

100
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
He also said that

101
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,860
you are from the Jun family

102
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,460
and skilled in textile and embroidery.

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,540
Liangzhou is a major source
of cotton and flax.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
So I have a humble request.

105
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,180
General, you are truly clever.

106
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,500
I knew you would come.

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,540
I've prepared tea for you.

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,980
Take a seat.

109
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,420
You revealed my identity and guided her

110
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,220
to ask me to impart embroidery skills.

111
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,700
Because you assumed
I wouldn't turn her down.

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,620
And it doesn't violate
our alliance pact.

113
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,380
It even helps you to win over Sun Clan.

114
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,140
You're truly scheming.

115
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,020
Miss Qi Luo, you are wise.

116
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,260
Nothing escapes your notice.

117
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,780
Nice try.

118
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,620
But I will say no.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,460
I only promised you

120
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,380
to teach the Xuan Clan,

121
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,440
not the Liangzhou people.

122
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,420
You said

123
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
merchants prioritize profit, right?

124
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,580
I did.

125
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,140
But I see no gains

126
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,060
in this particular deal.

127
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,740
If you agree to that,

128
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
and the needlework makes profits,

129
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,300
you can receive 20% of the profit.

130
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,980
Opening a shop and paying the workers

131
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,780
require some costs.

132
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,180
30% at most.

133
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,860
I learned the skills

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,540
from Mr. Feifan.

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,740
I can't use them for personal gain.

136
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,290
The workshops can operate
under the Jun family's name,

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
establishing the Juns' reputation
in Beixuan.

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,940
The Juns would see you in a new light.

139
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,420
Your wish to marry your young master

140
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,780
might even come true.

141
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,540
But Yannan and Beixuan
have never traded.

142
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,420
Even if the workshops are opened here

143
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,340
under the Juns' name,

144
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,180
it holds no benefit

145
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,980
for Mr. Feifan.

146
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,900
Not to mention marrying him.

147
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,100
General,

148
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,340
don't treat me like a child.

149
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,540
However, you really

150
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,460
care for the people of Liangzhou.

151
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,900
I am quite moved.

152
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,740
If you agree

153
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,700
to transport the cloth and embroidery

154
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,660
to the Jun family,

155
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,140
then I agree to this deal.

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,260
Wages in Liangzhou are low.

157
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
In this way,

158
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,740
it not only helps the Juns reduce costs,

159
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,700
but increases profits,

160
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,460
and expands the Juns' business

161
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,540
in Beixuan.

162
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,140
You're much more scheming than I am.

163
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,540
It's not my choice.

164
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,020
I have to report it to the King.

165
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
I'll figure a way out

166
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,460
to get his approval.

167
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,260
Alright.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,420
No worries. I'm not in a rush.

169
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,060
But I wonder if the refugees here

170
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,580
can afford to wait.

171
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Trust me.

172
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,940
You can work with Zhaomin first

173
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,380
to prepare for the workshops.

174
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,300
Qi Luo,

175
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,980
I know it requires hard work.

176
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,620
But regardless of success,
I want to try.

177
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,660
Alright.

178
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,750
Great!

179
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,420
The looms we use

180
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,380
are enhanced with black ore.

181
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,580
This boosts efficiency.

182
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,980
I wonder if Liangzhou

183
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,420
has such ore.

184
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
A piece of cake.

185
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,020
Liangzhou is rich in ores.

186
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,900
I'll bring all the ores then.

187
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,580
We can see if you need them.

188
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,900
Alright.

189
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,900
(I need to know
if black iron crystals are here.)

190
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,140
(I can also trade
with Beixuan this way.)

191
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,010
(Once it's done,)

192
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,540
(I can send Father the news.)

193
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,260
(Jun Mansion)

194
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,220
Master.

195
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,660
Master, something's wrong.

196
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,060
There's trouble in Qian City.

197
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,500
The workshops' owners were detained

198
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,720
by the Prefect for tax issues.

199
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,380
They require the person
in charge of the Juns

200
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,230
to explain this.

201
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,140
Otherwise, they won't release him.

202
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,700
It seems I must go personally.

203
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,060
Uncle Ling,

204
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,460
prepare my travel bags.

205
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,780
I'll depart early tomorrow.

206
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,580
It's just that in a few days,

207
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,500
it'll be time for us to restock.

208
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,380
A few days ago, the second branch

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,460
came with the managers to cause trouble.

210
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm still quite shaken by it.

211
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,460
I'm afraid if you're away,

212
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,020
they might stir up trouble again.

213
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,060
Chengsong is truly...

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,020
I've supported his family my whole life.

215
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,260
I've fulfilled my parents' dying wish.

216
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,340
General,

217
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
what does this mean?

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,900
I let you suffer in the Uncontrollable.

219
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,260
I feel guilty so I asked

220
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,100
Mrs. Sun to prepare this for you.

221
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,980
Thank you, General.

222
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,260
But for me,

223
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,620
it's more convenient
to wear men's attire.

224
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,380
You and Miss Sun work together daily.

225
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,900
Most of your colleagues are women.

226
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,940
It violates propriety.

227
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,220
To avoid gossip,

228
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,820
you'd better dress as a woman.

229
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,980
You are indeed thoughtful.

230
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,300
But Mr. Sun, Mrs. Sun,

231
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,140
and Zhaomin know I am a woman.

232
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,660
It's unnecessary to get changed.

233
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,700
It makes sense.

234
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,220
But I'm curious.

235
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,700
It's women's nature
to love splendid clothes.

236
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,940
Why are you not interested in these?

237
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
- I...
- Qi Luo.

238
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,100
I'm ready.

239
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's go.

240
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,940
This outfit is for Qi Luo?

241
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,500
Qi Luo,

242
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,300
I've never seen you in women's attire.

243
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,460
Go try it on!

244
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
I...

245
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,820
Go.

246
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,980
You truly are a beauty.

247
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,260
General Lie, are you mesmerized?

248
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,140
Let's go.

249
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,180
(Silver Embroidery)

250
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,740
A bit more to the left.

251
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,580
(Silver Embroidery)
Good.

252
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,050
Let's tear it all down!

253
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,260
Tear it down!

254
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,020
Smash them.

255
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,100
What are you doing?

256
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
Stop!

257
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,380
Stop!

258
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,380
Stop!

259
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,140
Don't break things!

260
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,260
Let's talk it out peacefully.

261
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,340
We're starving.

262
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,700
You and Mr. Sun,

263
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,700
instead of providing us with more food,

264
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
are spending lavishly

265
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,260
to open an embroidery workshop.

266
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,500
The Xi Leader

267
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,740
serves porridge daily at the city gate.

268
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,460
What's our Leader doing?

269
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,080
He doesn't care about us at all.

270
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,060
- He's right.
- Exactly.

271
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,900
Listen, everyone.

272
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,260
We open workshops

273
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,940
for your future benefit.

274
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,820
With this workshop,

275
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
you'll all have a stable job

276
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,660
and never go hungry again.

277
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,500
Easy for you to say.

278
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,340
Liangzhou cloth products

279
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,900
are always purchased from afar.

280
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,460
What's the point of opening a workshop?

281
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,580
- Exactly
- What's the point?

282
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,060
Why not use the money to buy grain

283
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,220
and share it with us?

284
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
He's right.

285
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,260
Listen to me.

286
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,340
We can use money to buy food for you.

287
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,540
But even so,

288
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,860
how long will this food last?

289
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,100
Liangzhou already lacks resources,

290
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,180
and we can't always supply food.

291
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,820
Only through self-reliance

292
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,660
can we ensure feeding ourselves.

293
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
She's right.

294
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,100
I know you have many doubts.

295
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,820
Liangzhou never had
an embroidery workshop.

296
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,060
However, this time,

297
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,700
we have strong support from General Lie.

298
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,900
He truly cares for you.

299
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,780
He's got permission from the King

300
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,220
to start trade
between Liangzhou and Yannan.

301
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,660
Then we can buy cotton and silk

302
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
needed for embroidery at low prices,

303
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
and sell our cloth and needlework

304
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,620
at high prices to various places.

305
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,740
In this way,

306
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,860
it could bring us great profit.

307
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,580
That sounds good.

308
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,980
General,

309
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,460
say something?

310
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,180
Miss Qi Luo is right.

311
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,820
The King has agreed
to trade with Yannan.

312
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,420
There's no need to worry.

313
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
Even so,

314
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,020
who knows if your weaving skills
are good enough?

315
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,460
Today, I'll show you

316
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,340
what we've got.

317
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,700
Can I get by?

318
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,300
Please, this way.

319
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,020
Nothing impressive.

320
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,500
It turns out to be average.

321
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,340
You're right.

322
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,660
They invited us over

323
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,300
but showed nothing special.

324
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,660
The weaving skills are indeed good.

325
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,980
But it's not worth us all

326
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,260
coming here to watch.

327
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,540
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

328
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,380
Wait a moment.

329
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,100
Take a closer look.

330
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,820
This...

331
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,420
It also has a pattern on the back.

332
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,980
This is Double-Sided Embroidery.

333
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,860
It means two patterns

334
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,420
are embroidered on the same cloth.

335
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,780
And the two sides have different colors.

336
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,340
This is truly rare.

337
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,540
What do you think?

338
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,740
Can this needlework

339
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,300
earn your favor?

340
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
- Perfect.
- Impressive.

341
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,300
I've run a cloth shop for decades,

342
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,540
but I've never seen such exquisite work.

343
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,380
Will Silver Embroidery produce this?

344
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,460
Miss.

345
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,900
Shall we discuss a partnership?

346
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,460
Miss.

347
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,020
My family has the biggest silk shop

348
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,500
in Liangzhou.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
How about this:

350
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,740
You sell all your needlework to me.

351
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
As you can see,

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,620
this workshop is really popular.

353
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
If you'd like to join,

354
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,420
register here as soon as possible.

355
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,060
- Me!
- Count me in!

356
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,100
Count me in.

357
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,540
That woman is
from the Jun family of Yannan.

358
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,500
It's my fault, Father.

359
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,140
I couldn't stop them.

360
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,220
How could you stop Xuan Lie

361
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,340
with such little tricks?

362
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,740
If the Silver Embroidery succeeds,

363
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,820
Sun Ba will surely support Xuan Lie.

364
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
Father,

365
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,300
what should we do next?

366
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,300
I won't let them succeed.

367
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
I have my own ways.

368
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,380
How is the caravan issue?

369
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,980
There hasn't been news

370
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,500
from the Death Warrior I sent.

371
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,300
Father,

372
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll send someone to investigate.

373
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,980
Can you use your brain a bit?

374
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,780
It's been so long.

375
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm afraid he's been killed.

376
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,340
Xuan Lie has kept our caravan for days.

377
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,220
He hasn't reported to the King.

378
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,220
It means he found no evidence.

379
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,500
Father, you mean

380
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,620
this is a trap?

381
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
Let's do nothing for now.

382
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,020
Just roll with the punches.

383
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,220
(Silver Embroidery)

384
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,180
Good news! Good news!

385
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,380
Auntie Sun from Yao City has rallied

386
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,020
many merchants to buy our products.

387
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,460
Great.

388
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,260
In five days,
we'll deliver the first batch.

389
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,180
Then we'll pay this month's wages.

390
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
Great!

391
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,060
What's wrong?

392
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,940
The machine seems broken.

393
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,820
What?

394
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
Go handle other tasks.

395
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,540
Let me take a look.

396
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,820
(The black iron crystals)

397
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,740
(might be used to improve looms)

398
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,460
(to enhance their durability.)

399
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,500
I was right about you.

400
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,900
Miss Qi Luo.

401
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,020
You're good at running a business
and embroidery.

402
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,220
You can even repair looms.

403
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,100
General, I'm flattered.

404
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,780
I can't repair looms.

405
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,540
I only know how to detect its flaws.

406
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,900
As for business and skills,

407
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,140
it's Mr. Feifan's credit.

408
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,780
Besides,

409
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,860
we can't make it without your support.

410
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,060
Among the ladies of the Juns,

411
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,140
whose embroidery skills are superior?

412
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,100
Of course the second lady.

413
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,500
Her embroidery
and kesi skills are top-notch.

414
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,780
And the third lady?

415
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,380
She isn't skilled in these.

416
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,900
She is lively and adorable,

417
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,340
but she's also a bit willful.

418
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,740
I remember you mentioned

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
the third lady
often challenges Jun Feifan.

420
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,900
Why do you still like her so much?

421
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,540
Indeed, she often opposes Mr. Feifan,

422
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,060
but she's kind to me.

423
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
I often advise her
not to treat him like that,

424
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,980
but she doesn't listen to me.

425
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Perhaps she holds prejudice against him.

426
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Prejudice?

427
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,140
You seem interested in the Jun ladies.

428
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,620
Luckily, the third lady is not married.

429
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,980
If you want,

430
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,060
when I return to Yannan,

431
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,380
I can play matchmaker for you both.

432
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,260
Compared to the Jun ladies,

433
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,860
I am more interested in you.

434
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,540
General, don't tease me.

435
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
You're interested in Mr. Feifan,

436
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,980
not me.

437
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,340
Young Master.

438
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,900
I finally found you.

439
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,300
(Silver Embroidery)

440
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,140
Young Master, you're fine.

441
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,780
I no longer have to worry.

442
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,580
You didn't arrive here on time.

443
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,980
Attacks?

444
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,300
Were there injuries?

445
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,740
You always know.

446
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,780
We suffered a few attacks on the way.

447
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,460
But since I'm trained by you,

448
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,660
they couldn't harm me.

449
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,740
Did you bring what I asked for?

450
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,780
Rest assured.

451
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,420
I brought all the seized weapons

452
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,340
and military supplies.

453
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
Young Master.

454
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,740
Take a look.

455
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,380
It's the information I got
from scouts in Yannan.

456
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,660
It took me immense effort.

457
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,500
For this letter,

458
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,800
I returned to the Message Outpost
of the Uncontrollable.

459
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,080
(Eldest daughter Jun Qiluo, aged 25)
That's why I'm late.

460
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,360
(You're indeed Jun Qiluo.)

461
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,620
(Silver Embroidery)

462
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,260
Something happened

463
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,700
at the Silver Embroidery.

464
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,140
Physician,

465
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,220
what happened?

466
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,060
It's eczema.

467
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,820
It seems quite serious.

468
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,420
How does eczema break out?

469
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,940
We looked into it just now.

470
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,020
We found animal fur

471
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,540
attached to the cloth.

472
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,300
It must be from starving animals.

473
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,540
The refugees live
in unsanitary environments

474
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,700
and can't dispose of dead animals.

475
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
The fur naturally carries

476
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,880
something unclean that can cause this.

477
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,220
That's why they fell ill.

478
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
You should stay away

479
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
to avoid infection.

480
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,860
What should we do now?

481
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,380
The delivery is due in three days,

482
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,260
but now everyone is sick.

483
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,660
The cloth is unusable too.

484
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,860
If we can't deliver,

485
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
our efforts will be in vain.

486
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,900
- Yes.
- Exactly.

487
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,340
Listen to me.

488
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,860
Our main task right now

489
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,100
is to cure eczema first.

490
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,180
Let the patients recover.

491
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
Rest assured.

492
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,260
Even if we can't deliver,

493
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,940
your wages won't be cut at all.

494
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,810
Easy for you to say.

495
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,500
They got sick in the workshop.

496
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,260
How do you act responsibly?

497
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,700
How's it going?

498
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,140
Mr. Sun,

499
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,460
over a dozen of embroiderers
are infected.

500
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,980
The situation is severe.

501
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,500
Miss Qi has managed this workshop

502
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,100
and selected the cloth in person.

503
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,940
But something is wrong with the cloth,

504
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,460
causing the eczema.

505
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,420
Miss Qi, you owe us an explanation.

506
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,340
Are you saying

507
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,780
I intentionally placed fur on the cloth

508
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,820
to harm the embroiderers?

509
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,460
I cannot make such a claim.

510
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,740
But may I ask you:

511
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,620
You know that Yannan and Beixuan

512
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,860
have had tense relations.

513
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,860
Why do you, a Yannan person,

514
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,820
come alone to Beixuan?

515
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,340
You also know it's hard for Yannan

516
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,340
and Beixuan to trade.

517
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,580
Yet you insist on starting the trade

518
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,820
and eagerly helping establish
this workshop.

519
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,900
Now the eczema breaks out from here.

520
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,700
All these events

521
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,180
connect to each other so logically.

522
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,100
If you claim you don't have evil plans,

523
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,940
then Miss Qi,

524
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,340
who would believe it?

525
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,540
- He's right.
- Exactly.

526
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,980
- He's right.
- What should we do now?

527
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,940
How could this happen?

528
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,060
Mr. Xi.

529
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,780
Miss Qi Luo acts on my order.

530
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,220
Her actions reflect my intentions.

531
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,180
Do you suspect me

532
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,220
of harming the Liangzhou people?

533
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,660
General Lie,

534
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,340
you are still young.

535
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,380
It's okay to misjudge someone.

536
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,060
But I hope this incident makes you

537
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,340
stop trusting that deceitful woman.

538
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,380
Their original intent

539
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,900
was to help refugees survive.

540
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,740
These embroiderers getting eczema

541
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,420
brings them no benefit at all.

542
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
However, Mr. Xi,

543
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
you seem very certain

544
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,060
that Miss Qi Luo should take the blame.

545
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,780
Did you see it with your own eyes?

546
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,140
Mr. Luo is right.

547
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,940
Qi always thinks about everyone.

548
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,980
This is definitely not her doing.

549
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,060
Mr. Sun,

550
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,860
since it's happened,

551
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,100
let's solve the issue first,

552
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,580
then find out who's at fault.

553
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,660
The General is right.

554
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,580
I will give everyone an explanation.

555
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,460
But the urgent matter now...

556
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,620
You should respond positively
to treatment.

557
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,260
Zhaomin,

558
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,340
send someone to burn the faulty cloth.

559
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
Burn them all.

560
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,220
Why?

561
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,060
Seriously?

562
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,220
How can this work?

563
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,100
I don't know.

564
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,060
Rest assured.

565
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,700
I will repurchase the cloth.

566
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,540
All expenses will be covered by us.

567
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,980
Zhaomin,

568
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,180
it's not your fault.

569
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,920
Qi.

570
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,140
I am the Princess of Sun Clan.

571
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,300
You and the Liangzhou people

572
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,580
are all my responsibilities.

573
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,380
Is there a remedy?

574
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
I once heard that

575
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,780
a medicine can ease this ailment.

576
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,460
But we need a lot of ginseng.

577
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,380
I've sent someone to the pharmacies.

578
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,460
They said ginseng is out of stock.

579
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,300
Out of stock?

580
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,180
What should we do now?

581
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,060
Mr. Sun, rest assured.

582
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,140
I founded the Silver Embroidery.

583
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,260
I will take full responsibility.

584
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,860
Leave the medicine to me.

585
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,100
I will prove my innocence

586
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,540
and give you an explanation.

587
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Miss Qi,

588
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,780
I give you three days.

589
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,140
If you fail to handle this properly,

590
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,900
I must do something
for the Liangzhou people.

591
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,980
Rest assured, Mr. Sun.

592
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,740
Within two days,

593
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
I will provide a satisfactory solution.

594
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,540
It makes no sense.

595
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,480
How did those animal fur

596
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,620
attach to the cloth?

597
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,660
It hasn't been windy.

598
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,460
And no one moved any animal corpses.

599
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,620
Could it be that their spirits

600
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,900
have returned to the city?

601
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,660
Miss Qi Luo, what do you think?

602
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,180
Just as Mr. Luo said,

603
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,700
it's been tampered with.

604
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,100
Someone must be framing us.

605
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,500
But as the General mentioned,

606
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,380
it's not time

607
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,980
to investigate the mastermind.

608
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,220
We must find a cure quickly

609
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,340
to ensure everyone's safety.

610
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,980
Let's check the city's pharmacies

611
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
for any ginseng left.

612
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,100
Let's work apart.

613
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,300
Sir, do you have ginseng?

614
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,580
Too bad.

615
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,420
All the ginseng

616
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,860
was sold out ten days ago.

617
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,820
It's out of stock.

618
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,380
Already out of stock.

619
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
No idea when it'll restock.

620
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,300
Ginseng is unavailable.

621
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,620
It's sold out a while back.

622
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,540
Seems someone beat us to it.

623
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,340
What do we do without ginseng?

624
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,380
All shops

625
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,420
sold out ginseng at the same time.

626
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,780
We need another way.

627
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,820
Time is running out.

628
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,100
The ill refugees can't wait.

629
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,580
(Yifeng Hall)
We can try

630
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,820
to find it in the mountains.

631
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,340
Your Highness. Miss Qi.

632
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,980
We heard about the eczema
in the workshop.

633
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,540
But it's the delivery day in three days.

634
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,900
Will the delivery be on time?

635
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm also wondering.

636
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,940
Something indeed went wrong
in the workshop.

637
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,300
We can't make it in three days.

638
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,820
Please give us a few more days.

639
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,740
That's not possible.

640
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,740
We've canceled other orders for this.

641
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,420
Without delivery, it will cause losses.

642
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,820
- Yeah.
- Stay calm.

643
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,460
I promise to solve this.

644
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,540
What's there to explain?

645
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,980
Either deliver it in time

646
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,780
or compensate us triple the loss.

647
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,500
Give our money back.

648
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,780
- Give it back.
- Give it back.

649
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,840
- You...
- Give it back.

650
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,690
Let's talk this out.

651
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,780
How dare you!

652
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,180
General Lie,

653
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,220
we fully supported your business.

654
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,980
Since there's a problem,

655
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,940
we can't be the ones to bear the loss.

656
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,260
Indeed.

657
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,540
I once told Zhaomin

658
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,900
that we'd make the Silver Embroidery
the largest workshop in Beixuan.

659
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,580
That promise still stands today.

660
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,420
If you wish to cancel previous orders,

661
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,700
we will refund your money in full.

662
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,580
If you still trust us,

663
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,220
the money you invested

664
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,860
will not only get you goods,

665
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,060
but also grant you extra profits.

666
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,060
Whenever the workshop generates profits,

667
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,260
all of you as small owners

668
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,860
can profit together.

669
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,100
The position of a small owner?

670
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,180
It sounds good.

671
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,060
Yes.

672
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,190
Indeed.

673
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,860
The Jun family and I

674
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
have worked for years

675
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,660
with all tycoons in Xixiang,

676
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,420
as well as small business owners.

677
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,780
No need to worry about the profits.

678
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,260
Just be patient,

679
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,740
and give me more time.

680
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,420
I promise your money

681
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,260
will yield over triple the profit.

682
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,380
Alright.

683
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,980
We'll trust you once more.

684
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,780
We hope you won't disappoint us.

685
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
Rest assured.

686
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,300
We keep our promises.

687
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,340
Let's go.

688
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,460
If I could become a small owner,

689
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
I'd be satisfied

690
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,860
- even with the double profits.
- Yes.

691
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,100
Luo Qi.

692
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,940
- Follow them.
- Yes.

693
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,260
(Sun Mansion)

694
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,100
Zhaomin.

695
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,260
It was urgent.

696
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,380
I made the decision
without consulting you.

697
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,140
It's okay.

698
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,380
I will always support

699
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,460
all your decisions.

700
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,100
I've only heard of the Jun family.

701
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,940
Didn't expect
you're also good at business.

702
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,380
I just learned it from Mr. Feifan.

703
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
Nothing special.

704
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,660
You're being modest.

705
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,860
It's definitely special.

706
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,660
The confidence you have

707
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,460
resembles Jun Feifan.

708
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,220
You've never seen him.

709
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,580
How would you know that?

710
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,980
I was merely imitating his style.

711
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,860
All the ginseng was sold out.

712
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,580
The merchants forced early refunds.

713
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,820
Someone must be behind all these.

714
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,340
What's your plan now?

715
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,140
We'll gather ginseng
in the mountains tomorrow.

716
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,900
I've sent the Twelve Light Cavalry

717
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,420
to the Uncontrollable to find it.

718
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,460
Zhizhou, I need your help.

719
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,860
Send messages to the wet nurses

720
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,500
and ask them to help with it.

721
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,300
But Young Master,

722
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,820
if we can't find ginseng anywhere,

723
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,140
what should we do then?

724
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,460
This mountain must have it.

725
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,060
(Sun Mansion)

726
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,180
Zhaomin.

727
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,140
Yes?

728
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,780
I heard General Lie and Miss Qi

729
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,500
went to Mount Qi to find ginseng.

730
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,740
It's already past noon.

731
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,300
Why haven't they returned yet?

732
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Ginseng

733
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,740
seems not so easy to find.

734
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,140
Don't worry.

735
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,780
They will surely find it.

736
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,780
They say wild ginseng

737
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,660
is much stronger than cultivated ones.

738
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,740
Once they find it,

739
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,420
the embroiderers will soon recover.

740
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,380
Silver Embroidery can operate as usual.

741
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,740
Excuse me.

742
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,260
Check over there.

743
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,140
Let's go.

744
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,820
Fine. I'll go.

745
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,100
Take this.

746
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,460
Are you alright?

747
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,380
You chose a perfect spot.

748
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
You won't get hurt.

749
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,740
Did you cut the vines?

750
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,020
If I hadn't cut the vines,

751
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,580
they couldn't have taken the ginseng.

752
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,420
You're trying

753
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,620
to use us as a bait?

754
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,340
Otherwise, how would they
expose themselves?

755
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,940
They didn't expect

756
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,860
that you're so scheming.

757
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,060
General,

758
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,300
can you...

759
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,380
let go of me?

760
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,180
How can we get down?

761
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,860
Miss Qi Luo.

762
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,980
You've miscalculated.

763
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,700
It seems we can't return tonight.

764
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,540
Let's make do here tonight.

765
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,820
Didn't expect you to fear mice.

766
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,780
It's just a mouse.

767
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,660
What's it to fear?

768
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,620
The house is old and worn.

769
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,220
It's normal to see a mouse here.

770
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
Indeed.

771
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,860
Though you're a woman,

772
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,860
you act like a man.

773
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,900
You just don't know much about us.

774
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,300
Not all women

775
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,380
are afraid of mice.

776
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,700
Let's rest.

777
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,900
