41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,780

about our marriage?

42
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,330
He will find out sooner or later.

43

48
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,600
how have you been lately?

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,030

51
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,430

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm so sorry.

Qiluo.

56
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Father,

57
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,240
I brought this upon you

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,710
and made us lose our business.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,400
This is not your fault.

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,590

63
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,040
Father, don't worry.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,480
I'll get everything we lost back.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
By the way,

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,760
why did the King suddenly
let you back home?

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,510
The King said your wedding
is coming up soon,

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,040
so he allowed me to return.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Qimin,

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
I've always wished

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,000
for you two to get married.

72
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,350
Get up.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,630
Qiluo has had a hard time before.

74
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,240
Please treat her well from now on.

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,320
Don't worry, Master.

76
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,630
I'll protect her for the rest of my life.

77
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,870
Father, Qimin has been

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,430
by Qiluo's side all these years,

79
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,830
loyal and devoted to her.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,070
What's there to worry about?

81
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes, Father.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
After they get married,

83
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,000

84

Qiluo,

271
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,680
why do you have to marry Shao Qimin?

272
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,400
Qimin is a spy the King
sent to the Jun family.

273
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,960
Our marriage is the King's command.

274
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,070
The King has never trusted us.

275
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
If I don't marry Qimin, the King

276
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,260
will be convinced that my family is disloyal.

277
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,160
Then my family will be doomed.

278
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,760
Qiluo,

279
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,000
don't worry.

280
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,830
I'll figure this out.

281
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,310
I'll go back with you tomorrow.

288
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,590
we didn't get married yesterday.

289
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,750
Did they blame you for it?

290
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,790
Why is it so quiet?

291
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,640
You should ask him and Qingkou

292
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,830
to see what they're up to.

293
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,280
Qingkou?

294
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,390
Qingming,

295
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,670
Lie,

296
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,790
you're all back.

297
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,200
Why do you have to marry Shao Qimin

298
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
for Miss Jun?

299
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,390
It's just for fun.

300
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
Jun Qiluo has disappeared,

301
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,160
so I can take her place.

302
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,550
I don't have to worry about
Qingming running away again.

303
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,790
What do you think of this wedding dress?

304
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Marriage is no joke.

305
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,110
You can't act so recklessly.

306
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
What if you regret it?

307
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll never regret it.

308
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
If Qingming marries someone else,

309
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,240
I'll regret it.

310
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,510
He can only be mine.

311
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,310
So you two got married yesterday,

312
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,790
and no one found out?

313
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,870
Jun Qiluo,

314
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,830
Qingming is mine.

315
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,030
We're married now.

316
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,790
You should keep your distance from him.

317
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,040
My Lady,

318
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,370
it's an accident.

319
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,640
There's nothing between us.

320
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,550
But we completed the rites.

321
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,980
We are married.

322
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,550
It's a pity I didn't marry you in Beixuan.

323
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,040
But I finally married you here,

324
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,070
that is quite good.

325
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,310
Don't try to deny it.

326
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,100
I didn't know you were the bride

327
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,590
until we entered the bridal chamber.

328
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,840
Then I went to find Miss Jun.

329
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,030
We didn't consummate.

330
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,160
So we're not even married!

331
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,680
- You...
- Qingkou.

332
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,000
Marriage is a big deal.

333
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,130
You're acting recklessly.

334
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,640
Who brought you here?

335
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,880
He Jiyao.

336
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,200
- Young Master.
- It's you, isn't it?

337
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,640
Why didn't you stop her?

338
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
Lie,

339
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,070
this has nothing to do with him.

340
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,240
No one can stop me

341
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
from doing what I want.

342
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,630
Beixuan and Yannan are in peace talks.

343
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,590
If anyone finds out we are in Yannan,

344
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,720
it will cause a huge uproar.

345
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,560
Do you understand?

346
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,510
He Jiyao will escort you
back to Beixuan tomorrow.

347
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
No way.

348
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,160
I came here to see Qingming.

349
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,510
I'll go if he comes back with me.

350
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,350
Qingkou!

351
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,350
Lie, aren't you here to see Jun Qiluo?

352
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,240
If you can do this,

353
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,080
why can't I?

354
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,350
Yesterday was an accident,

355
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,510
but we covered it.

356
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,070
Let's think about
how to handle things from here on.

357
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,800
But, My Lady,

358
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,880
our marriage was granted by the King.

359
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm afraid...

360
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,580
We'll pretend nothing happened yesterday.

361
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,680
- No way!
- No way!

362
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,270
- I didn't marry her.
- We're married.

363
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,880
I won't allow you to marry Jun Qiluo.

364
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,280
Xuan Lie,

365
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,350
what right do you have
to boss around here?

366
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,840
Shao Qimin,

367
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,650
I've tolerated you long enough.

368
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,800
Bring it on, then.

369
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,030
Qiluo, are you awake?

370
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,240
Qiluo?

371
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,820
(Peaceful Nation)

372
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,820
Qiluo,

373
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,000
I think I heard some people

374
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
talking in your room.

375
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
You heard wrong.

376
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,480
Qimin and I were talking about the business.

377
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,000
We've already finished

378
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
50,000 bolts of silk with other shops.

379
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
The rest need to be made quickly.

380
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,480
Have you been following up on the silk gauze?

381
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,590
Qiluo,

382
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,270
it's your first day after the wedding.

383
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,200
Put aside the business for a moment.

384
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,880
You and Qimin should serve tea to Father

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,350
and incense to Mother.

386
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,040
Qiluo,

387
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,530
why are you in the clothes
from before the wedding?

388
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
What was that?

389
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,400
Qimin is changing his clothes.

390
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,350
Don't go in yet.

391
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,960
Go do your thing.

392
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I'll go with Qimin
to serve tea to Father.

393
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,680
I have nothing to do right now.

394
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,430
Qiluo,

395
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,270
your hair is also...

396
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,840
By the way,

397
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,640
weren't you going to hire some workers?

398
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,240
But why haven't you found anyone yet?

399
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,960
Workers? I...

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,160
I totally forgot about him.

401
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,440
Forgot about whom?

402
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,160
A few days ago, I hired a worker.

403
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,240
We agreed to meet today,

404
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,100
but with so much going on,
I completely forgot.

405
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,590
Qiluo, I have to go.

406
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,560
Go ahead.

407
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,480
Qiluo.

408
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,830
What happened yesterday would be our secret.

409
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,680
Leave here with Qingkou and He Jiyao now.

410
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,760
We leave,

411
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,690
and you two act like a couple?

412
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,830
Qimin and I must be a couple,

413
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,230
or we'll defy the royal decree.

414
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,830
It'll drag my family down.

415
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,270
You can act like a couple,

416
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,480
but you can't share a room.

417
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,350
That's none of your business.

418
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,800
Xuan Lie,

419
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,310
don't push your luck.

420
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,350
Qiluo...

421
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,720
Lie,

422
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,020
leave it to me.

423
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,160
I'll stay here and guard them.

424
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,040
Come here.

425
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,240
I won't interfere with your private life,

426
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,480
but things are getting tense.

427
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,160
Can Qingkou stay at your mansion for now?

428
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,760
Alright, but take them out
as soon as possible.

429
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,140
(Yamen)

430
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,590
Look at him, young and healthy,

431
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,310
yet begging outside the jail.

432
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,320
Take it.

433
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,630
Come on, ma'am.

434
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,670
She's kind, though.

435
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,550
Do you know
how long I've been waiting?

436
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,630
Sorry, I'm late.

437
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,920
I got held up by something.

438
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,480
Why didn't you
come to the mansion to find me?

439
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,400
But you said

440
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,200
you would come and pick me up.

441
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,230
I don't know this place.

442
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,460
How could I dare go by myself?

443
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,270
People even mistook me for a beggar.

444
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,750
Alright.

445
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,790
Now that you'll work for me,

446
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,000
you'll have money and a wife.

447
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,550
I announce, from now on,
you work for the Juns.

448
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
Come home with me.

449
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,110
Coming!

450
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
Your Majesty,

451
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,400
this is the peace agreement
drafted by Beixuan envoys.

452
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,440
Beixuan will take the lead

453
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,270
in setting up a trading post
in the Uncontrollable.

454
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,270
Every year, we'll pay Beixuan
100,000 taels of silver

455
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,200
and 150,000 bolts of silk

456
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,240
for the development of the trading post.

457
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
Your Majesty,

458
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,270
these years, all the taxes have been used

459
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,920
for strengthening border defenses,

460
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,440
and the national treasury has no funds.

461
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,310
Let the envoys negotiate first.

462
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,030
The trading post can make a profit.

463
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,400
The silver and silk
can be considered an investment.

464
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,790
How's Jun Qiluo's wedding going?

465
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,720
Your Majesty,

466
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,300
everything is going smoothly.

467
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,680
Jun Qiluo has been busy
managing the shop.

468
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,160
Nothing seemed off.

469
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,030
We don't have many rules.

470
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,460
Everyone is easy to get along with.

471
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,750
You just need to do your work.

472
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,240
Miss Jiangjuan,

473
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,160
I didn't expect you
to like reading novels.

474
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,590
Yes, do you like them too?

475
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,480
Of course, I even write them.

476
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,960
I'll write one
and show it to you.

477
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,870
Okay.

478
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,870
Miss Jiangjuan,

479
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,830
I've got something urgent that just came up.

480
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,920
Could you please

481
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,750
take these books back by yourself?

482
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,400
I'll come by later to see you.

483
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,510
Where are you going?

484
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,000
Are you backing out

485
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,510
and refusing to work for us?

486
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,590
I'm telling you.

487
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,960
This is a rare opportunity.

488
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
You should cherish it.

489
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Of course, I do cherish it.

490
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,680
It's a blessing for you
to offer me this job.

491
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
I won't miss this chance.

492
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,910
I'll be right back.

493
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,870
Alright then,

494
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,640
but come back quickly,
and don't run off.

495
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,280
What?

496
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,550
The King of Yannan

497
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,440
betrothed Miss Jun and Shao Qimin,

498
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,550
but Princess Qingkou

499
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,640
married Shao Qimin instead?

500
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,270
While I was gone these past few days,

501
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,240
so much has happened.

502
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,390
Luo Qi,

503
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,880
Qingkou and He Jiyao
are staying at Jun Mansion.

504
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,760
Could you...

505
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,730
get me in there as well?

506
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,720
To protect Qingkou, of course.

507
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,870
Yes,

508
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
protecting Princess Qingkou is important.

509
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,040
But Young Master,

510
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,510
you have another reason,

511
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,350
don't you?

512
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,270
I told you. It's to protect Qingkou.

513
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,910
True.

514
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,640
Having Miss Jun and Shao Qimin
under the same roof

515
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,400
is quite annoying.

516
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,180
Keep your identity hidden.

517
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,180
Yes.

518
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,080
Don't trouble the Juns.

519
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,710
See you.

520
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,070
So, he's your fellow townsman,

521
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,720
also here to find a job?

522
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,100
He's De Lie, my fellow townsman,

523
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,000
strong and capable.

524
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,510
He can do any kind of work.

525
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,350
Like me, he only needs
10 wen per month.

526
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,160
You seem to be in good health,

527
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,790
and you look quite sharp.

528
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,830
Unlike Luo Qi,
you have no criminal record.

529
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,160
You can find other jobs.

530
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,830
Why do you choose to work for us?

531
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,350
Luo Qi,

532
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,590
you tell her.

533
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,530
We just arrived in the Royal Capital,

534
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,550
without a penny

535
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,000
or connections.

536
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm lucky to have met you, Miss Jiangjuan.

537
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,830
You've been so kind to me,

538
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,350
and gave me this job.

539
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,400
When I left my hometown,

540
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,920
his parents asked me to look after him,

541
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,110
so I bear this responsibility.

542
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,750
Since I work here now,

543
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,400
I have to bring him along.

544
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Miss Jiangjuan,

545
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,630
we are cheap,

546
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,110
but we'll work hard.

547
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
Please hire us.

548
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,480
(20 wen for two young
and strong workers,)

549
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,590
(this deal will surely)

550
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,070
(earn Qiluo's praise.)

551
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
(Although they don't seem very bright,)

552
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,000
(it would be fine,)

553
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,060
(as long as they can work.)

554
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,190
You poor outsiders,

555
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,350
with no one to turn to.

556
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,430
Alright,

557
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,550
I'll be a good employer

558
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,070
and hire both of you.

559
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
Miss Jiangjuan,

560
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,590
I've drafted the contract

561
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,710
and signed your name for you.

562
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,960
Please have a look. Here you are.

563
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,360
Why the rush?

564
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,350
Because...

565
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,680
If you don't hire us today,

566
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,920
we won't have anything to eat.

567
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,980
We're down to our last crumbs here.

568
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,030
Miss Jiangjuan, please take us home.

569
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,940
(Contract)

570
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
You two will get 20 wen a month.

571
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,200
If I break the contract
and fire you, I'll pay you...

572
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,890
100 taels of gold?

573
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,230
Life is hard now,

574
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,590
but De Lie and I are both loyal.

575
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,330
Miss Jiangjuan, I know
you need reliable workers.

576
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,190
That way, we can all rest easy.

577
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,220
(Employer: Jun Jiangjuan)

578
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,120
Chancellor,

579
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,710
how could the King let Jun Qiluo,

580
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,070
the Baigong's heir, marry a guard?

581
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,880
I'm sorry, but I have no clue

582
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,400
to get the reasoning behind this.

583
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,920
Jun Qiluo stayed in Beixuan for ages,

584
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,510
and she's so close with the Wolf Lord.

585
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,760
Their relationship is serious.

586
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,710
The King is obviously suspicious,

587
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,760
and he'd question her loyalty.

588
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,190
The only way to calm him down

589
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,730
is for her to marry a Yannan man.

590
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,280
As for whom she marries,

591
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,440
it doesn't matter at all.

592
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
Are they the workers you hired?

593
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
Yes, Qiluo.

594
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,280
Look at them, they're strong and healthy,

595
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,190
perfect for tough,
heavy, and exhausting work.

596
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,190
Moreover, we only need to pay them

597
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,280
20 wen per month.

598
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,440
We've made a great deal.

599
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,500
What about the penalty fee?

600
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,430
100 taels of gold.

601
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,710
Qiluo, though it's quite expensive,

602
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,840
why would we

603
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,800
fire such cheap workers?

604
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,960
Wouldn't that be foolish?

605
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,710
Jiangjuan, haven't I told you

606
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,630
that unequal contracts

607
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,440
will lead to countless troubles?

608
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
How could you sign such a contract?

609
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,230
But Qiluo, you also said

610
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,190
that unequal contracts

611
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,670
can bring huge profits.

612
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,190
We need workers now.

613
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,550
Why not take a gamble?

614
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,880
Is the contract government-approved?

615
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,470
Qingming,

616
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,480
you can only be mine.

617
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,720
Get in.

618
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,470
Didn't I tell you

619
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,980
to stay hidden?

620
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,480
Are you worried
that Qiluo will be in trouble

621
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,320
if people find out

622
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,590
you two aren't married?

623
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,600
Alright,

624
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,110
you have my promise.

625
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,710
I won't let anyone know I'm here.

626
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,960
But you must agree to two things.

627
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,880
First, whenever I blow this whistle,

628
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,110
you must appear,

629
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,840
just like you did in Beixuan.

630
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,160
Second,

631
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,190
from now on, you must do

632
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,230
whatever I ask.

633
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,960
What? You won't agree?

634
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Then I'll just go out there

635
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,840
and walk around.

636
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,800
Maybe I'll visit Jun Qiluo's father.

637
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,320
Remember,

638
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,070
Jun Qiluo must not be seen here.

639
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,470
Also,

640
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm hungry.

641
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,060
Who would've thought
the Wolf Lord of Beixuan

642
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,030
would end up

643
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,880
as a servant here in Yannan?

644
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,190
Because you're impressive.

645
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,360
You've made me, the Wolf Lord of Beixuan,

646
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,480
willing to be your servant.

647
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,150
Look, I brought you here
to talk business.

648
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I want to talk about this contract.

649
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,640
Go ahead.

650
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,880
You want to change
the contract in two places.

651
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,280
First, I'd like to
borrow 500 bolts of silk

652
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,800
from the order for another project.

653
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,440
Second, the delivery period
was three months,

654
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,710
I want to extend it by one month.

655
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
Any conditions?

656
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,480
Based on the original price,

657
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,680
I'll pay the daily interest
for the extra month.

658
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,000
Since I'm borrowing 500 bolts,

659
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
I'll return you all 600 bolts

660
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,150
after four months.

661
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,440
That sounds fair.

662
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,840
Then it's settled.

663
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,230
But honestly,

664
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,880
it's not really appealing to me.

665
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
I reject it.

666
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,190
So, what are your conditions?

667
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,030
Lay it out for me.

668
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
You should know

669
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,280
what I want by now.

670
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,670
I don't want you living with Shao Qimin.

671
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,270
That's a different thing.

672
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,880
We're discussing business now.

673
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,670
To me, it's the same thing.

674
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,760
Seeing you two living together

675
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
makes me want to kill him.

676
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,360
Fine, I agree.

677
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,880
We weren't sharing a bed anyway.

678
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,110
I'll rework the contract.

679
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,510
You keep your word.

680
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,060
There you go.

681
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,490
Now, serve the dishes for me.

682
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,670
I want you to feed me.

683
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
If you try to leave again,

684
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,730
I'll go to see Jun Qiluo's father.

685
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,800
I want meat.

686
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,110
I've changed my mind.

687
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,030
Just give me that.

688
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,070
You barely touched anything

689
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,360
since the wedding.

690
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,590
You must be tired and hungry.

691
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,920
Eat it.

692
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,070
Alright, let's have dinner together.

693
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,280
Come on.

694
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,550
Satin for sale!

695
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,800
Don't worry.

696
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,630
This time, I won't let them succeed.

697
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,960
The clothes made by Miss Jun

698
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
are truly beautiful.

699
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,110
She seems different after the wedding.

700
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,720
How so?

701
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,150
Her voice sounded quite different.

702
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,480
Miss Qiluo, no rush.

703
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,320
Don't touch me.

704
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,280
You must have misheard.

705
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,000
How could the bride be someone else?

706
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,880
This is ridiculous.

707
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,070
