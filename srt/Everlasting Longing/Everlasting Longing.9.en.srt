I'm fine.

19
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,540
Come on.

You're injured.

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,270
It's nothing serious.

23
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,670
The exit is blocked.

24
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,390
We'll have to find another way out.

25
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,190
Come on.

26
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,580
What? Is your foot hurt?

27
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,270
I'm fine. I can walk.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,400
Get on. I'll carry you.

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,070
You've been injured.
I can walk on my own.

30
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,350
Jun Qiluo.

31
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,790
Or should I call you Jun Feifan?

32
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,420
Don't make me say it again.

33
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,260
Get on.

34
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,860
Young Master.

35
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,350
Come on. Move the rocks.

36
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,830
Move the rocks.

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
Let's go.

38
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,700
Report today's explosion
to the King first.

39
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,480
Then ask him to seal this place off

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,330
and remove bomb sites.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Remember:

42
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,420
No one is allowed to enter,
except for you.

43
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,430
Young Master,

44
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,110
the Xi...

45
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,180
With the King's decree,

46
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,910
Xi Changkun won't say anything.

47
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
Yes.

48
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,470
Young Master, I heard the mine exploded.

49
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you okay?

50
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm fine.

51
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,660
What is this?

52
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,780
Look.

53
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,190
Young Master.

54
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,350
This is the latest intel
from the spies in Yannan.

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,670
This is a portrait of Jun Feifan.

56
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,990
When I first opened it,

57
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,670
I thought he looked a lot like Miss Jun.

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,350
But actually, he's not.

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,590
Get to the point.

60
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,930
The man in this portrait

61
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,620
has a brown mole
at the corner of his eye.

62
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,670
The scout also reported

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,870
that Jun Feifan appeared
at his home in Yannan.

64
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,560
After meeting with the Xixiang caravan,

65
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,890
he went directly to Qian City.

66
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
But Jun Feifan is quite handsome.

67
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,300
They're truly siblings.

68
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,670
General, are you here

69
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,990
to ask me if I'm Jun Feifan?

70
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,220
Are you?

71
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,860
I wish I were.

72
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,420
Then I could come and go freely,

73
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,620
instead of spending years
in Qian City recovering,

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,700
with no one caring for me.

75
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,420
I could only wait until I recovered

76
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,060
so I could beg Feifan
to take me along on his trips.

77
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,950
See?

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,740
I've been out for so long,

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,720
but none of my family
is looking for me.

80
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,740
They wouldn't do this
if Feifan was missing.

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm so different from Feifan.

82
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,860
How could you suspect I'm Jun Feifan?

83
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,380
I was just asking.

84
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,510
Let's go back.

85
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,830
Come on.

86
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,390
Thank you, General.

87
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,990
The King and Queen Mother are here.

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,700
- Yu.
- Your Majesty.

89
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,060
- Mother.
- What's going on?

90
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,430
Yu.

91
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,260
How is Yu?

92
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,390
Mother.

93
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,810
The imperial physician says
he was overly frightened

94
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,110
so he needs some time to rest.

95
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,950
My King,

96
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,910
have you found out
what's behind this?

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,350
Luo Zhizhou has investigated this.

98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,180
There were too many people
at the horse ranch,

99
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,710
so the horse went wild out of scare

100
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,620
and frightened Yu.

101
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,420
I've dealt

102
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,500
with the rider responsible.

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,550
In a few days,
it'll be the Hunting Event.

104
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,030
I had planned to take the Queen

105
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,110
and Yu with me,

106
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,740
but now it seems

107
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,500
Yu is likely

108
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,150
to be afraid of horses.

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,270
King,

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,790
Yu has always been brave.

111
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,300
He wouldn't become timid

112
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,740
just because of one shock.

113
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,350
These days, he's been insisting
on going to the event.

114
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,860
There will be plenty of chances to play.

115
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,740
For now, you should take care of Yu.

116
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,060
That's the priority now.

117
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,670
When he's recovered,

118
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,500
there will be plenty of time
for riding and archery.

119
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,580
Mother.

120
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,860
Just listen to the King.

121
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,230
Stay in the Palace and take care of Yu.

122
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,380
Yes, Mother.

123
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,460
(Xuan Mansion)

124
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,530
I'll bring you some medicine tonight.

125
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,550
Thank you.

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,700
General, you should
rest and heal as well.

127
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,030
It's dangerous all the way

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,030
from Yannan to Beixuan.

129
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,500
We nearly died several times.

130
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,260
Looks like I must complete

131
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,300
the pact with you

132
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,790
and return home asap.

133
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,510
Lie.

134
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

135
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,950
Lie.

136
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,790
Qimin.

137
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,540
Qimin, you're still alive.

138
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,230
I thought you...

139
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
Why are you dressed like this?

140
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,140
This is a long story.

141
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,600
We'll talk about it later.

142
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,780
Running around again?

143
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,010
How many times have I told you?

144
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,590
I was looking for you.

145
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,430
It's him.

146
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,350
Who are you?

147
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,500
Stay away from my slave.

148
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,030
Slave?

149
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
Qingkou,

150
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,430
don't be rude.

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,040
Lie,

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,470
though I didn't find you this time,

153
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,710
I won a slave during my trip.

154
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,430
Look.

155
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,900
How do you like my slave?

156
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,140
Did you hurt his face?

157
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,990
He was so handsome

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,780
that he almost got sold as a gigolo.

159
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,740
I was saving him, not hurting him.

160
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,830
Right?

161
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,540
Lie, do you think my whip skills
have improved?

162
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,710
Should I show you now?

163
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
Qingkou,

164
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,620
stop messing around.

165
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,090
I'm not messing around.

166
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,830
Qingming.

167
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,590
Why aren't you talking to me?

168
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,620
Don't ignore me
just because of Lie's slave.

169
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,700
Qingkou,

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,950
Miss Jun is not a slave.

171
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,310
She's my honored guest.

172
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

173
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,050
I'm Jun Qiluo, a merchant from Yannan.

174
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Lie,

175
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,230
did you two...?

176
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,590
How else could a Yannan merchant girl

177
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,830
become your honored guest?

178
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,710
Miss Jun saved my life,

179
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,160
so of course, she's my honored guest.

180
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,900
You saved Lie's life?

181
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,980
Well,

182
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,590
then you are also my honored guest.

183
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,030
How generous of you.

184
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,230
I have one more request.

185
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,170
I hope you'll grant it.

186
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Tell me.

187
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
First, thank you
for saving Qimin's life.

188
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,230
This person with you

189
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,620
is the Juns' guard, Shao Qimin.

190
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,140
We were separated not long ago.

191
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,980
He's not a slave.

192
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,960
Princess, I hope you can release him.

193
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,260
I just said

194
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,430
Qingming is my slave.

195
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,070
Even if you are Lie's honored guest,

196
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,300
you still can't take him away.

197
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,990
Are you challenging me?

198
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,780
May I ask how shall we proceed?

199
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,020
Mount Li's hunting ground
has the most wolves.

200
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,990
How about a wolf hunt?

201
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,230
If you win,

202
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,230
he'll be yours.

203
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,620
Fine.

204
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,230
Qingkou, stop messing around.

205
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,970
Lie,

206
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,380
this is a game between the ladies.

207
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,220
You can't interfere.

208
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,110
Miss Jun's leg was hurt.

209
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,190
I'm sure you don't want to win
by unfair means.

210
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,570
Why don't you rest for one day

211
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,960
and start the game tomorrow?

212
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,860
Alright.

213
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,830
I never take advantage
of other.

214
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,830
So, we'll go to Mount Li's

215
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,740
hunting ground tomorrow to settle this.

216
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,950
Alright.

217
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,740
You've traveled a long way.

218
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,830
You should rest now.

219
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,430
Don't make the King worry.

220
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,950
Let's go. I'll show you my palace.

221
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,140
Why are you stopping me?

222
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,860
If the contest is delayed,
Qimin will suffer more.

223
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,430
You're the Zhuge Liang of women,

224
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,310
so you're naturally
much smarter than her,

225
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,860
but Qingkou grew up on horseback.

226
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
Can you beat her?

227
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,230
How would you know I can't win
before the contest?

228
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,500
No matter what,

229
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,430
I must rescue Qimin asap.

230
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,150
My Lady,

231
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,190
you are so kind to your servants.

232
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,740
Qimin is not a servant.

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,540
He grew up in my family.

234
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
He's like family to me.

235
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,540
I brought him out

236
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,020
but didn't protect him well,

237
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,630
letting him fall into this state.

238
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,310
It's my fault.

239
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,500
My Lady,

240
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,500
if you win the game tomorrow,

241
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,430
he'll be able to return to your side.

242
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,710
Qingkou is a Princess.

243
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,310
Even if I win,

244
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,260
she may not keep her promise.

245
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,950
We still have the general.

246
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,830
He'll definitely help you.

247
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,910
The general?

248
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,470
He'll only help the Princess.

249
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,020
How could he help me?

250
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,340
My Lady, you're overthinking it.

251
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,030
Look.

252
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,590
The general knows you're not used
to the food here,

253
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,710
so he had Luo Qi

254
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,780
find chefs from Yannan
to cook for you.

255
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,620
He also sent the He caravan
to the Uncontrollable

256
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,620
to buy Yannan spices for you.

257
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,820
The general comes
from a military background

258
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,450
and doesn't care
about living conditions,

259
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,900
but he doesn't neglect yours.

260
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,830
This shows how much
the general cares for you.

261
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,620
The general also knows

262
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,990
that Yannan food is small and delicate,

263
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,710
while Beixuan uses large plates,

264
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,620
so he found many
delicate bowls and plates.

265
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
The cheese is even made
in bite-sized pieces.

266
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,260
I've noticed how the general

267
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,740
is attentive to you.

268
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,470
He may have ulterior motives.

269
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,190
My Lady, you can test him a little.

270
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,500
The Princess is the King's only sister.

271
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,350
No one in Beixuan dares to offend her,

272
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,230
but the general's words

273
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,990
still mean something to her.

274
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,070
My Lady, if you're worried,

275
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,190
just talk to the general.

276
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,860
However unreasonable the Princess was,

277
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,710
he refused to leave.

278
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,140
Now I understand.

279
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
The reason he followed the Princess
back to the Royal City

280
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,290
is to bring back Qi...

281
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,190
Miss Qiluo.

282
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,110
Without my permission,

283
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,430
no one could take her away.

284
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,210
But Young Master,

285
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,630
in order to have Miss Jun

286
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,830
draw out Jun Feifan,

287
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,740
we must rescue

288
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,260
this slave.

289
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,030
What do you think

290
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,070
their relationship is?

291
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,780
What relationship?

292
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,140
He's just his guard.

293
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,230
He just called her My Lady.

294
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,070
Did you hear that?

295
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,150
Yes.

296
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,580
Young Master,

297
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,590
are you displeased?

298
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,500
What I mean is

299
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,710
he called her Mr. Qi Luo
in the Uncontrollable.

300
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,140
You're still pondering this?

301
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,350
Miss Jun was pretending
to be Jun Feifan.

302
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,220
Of course, the caravan
would help cover it up,

303
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,260
let alone her personal guard.

304
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,540
And Jun Feifan

305
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,740
has appeared in Yannan.

306
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,020
What's there to doubt?

307
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,430
Miss Jun is the eldest daughter
of the Jun family.

308
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,350
Send a message to Jun Feifan.

309
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,530
If he cares for his sister's safety,

310
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,080
he should hurry to the Execution Valley
of the Uncontrollable.

311
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,350
But it's rumored
that Jun Feifan is very cautious,

312
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,950
so he probably won't take risks
for Miss Qiluo.

313
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,860
Let's confirm
Jun Feifan's identity first.

314
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,860
Then we can capture him.

315
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,820
I didn't get the chance
to ask the young master.

316
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,540
When did Mr. Qi Luo

317
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,900
become Miss Qiluo?

318
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,500
Well, you don't know this.

319
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,950
Miss Jun disguised herself as a man.

320
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,140
Her real identity

321
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,020
is Jun Qiluo of the Jun family.

322
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,340
Slow down.

323
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,990
Mother, this horse is too slow.

324
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,430
It's not as good to ride
as the one a few days ago.

325
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,950
Your Majesty,

326
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,620
Prince Yi is making such a noise.

327
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,900
Shall I go tell him off?

328
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,840
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

329
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,390
Prince Yi.

330
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,540
Please be quiet.

331
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,390
- Yi.
- Your Ladyship.

332
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,340
Prince Yu was frightened by the horse.

333
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,870
He's still terrified,

334
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,500
but Prince Yi is making such a noise.

335
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
He may disturb Prince Yu.

336
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,710
Greetings, Your Majesty.

337
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,630
Greetings, Father.

338
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,230
Your Majesty,

339
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,580
Yi didn't mean to disturb Prince Yu.

340
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,470
He was so happy
after riding the horse days ago,

341
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,020
so he kept asking to ride again.

342
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,910
That's why I thought of this idea.

343
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,520
Father, don't blame Mother.

344
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,910
I asked Mother to play with me.

345
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,630
In that case,

346
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,910
Yi should go to the Hunting Event

347
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,870
and enjoy the game.

348
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,460
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Father.

349
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,100
General, what do you mean?

350
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,430
I taught Qingkou martial arts.

351
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,910
She got four-tenths of my true skills.

352
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,870
You can't even avoid the simplest punch.

353
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,400
How will you win her tomorrow?

354
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,780
You're right.

355
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,390
I need your help.

356
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,250
It's the first time
you've asked me for help,

357
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,340
but it was for a man.

358
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,150
Is he so important to you?

359
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,910
He has been by my side since childhood,

360
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,500
never letting me suffer.

361
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,680
Now, he's fallen into such a state
because of me.

362
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,260
So, no matter what,

363
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,500
I have to save him.

364
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,580
He is Jun Feifan's guard.

365
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,400
You were recovering in Qian City.

366
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,990
Why is your bond so deep?

367
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,060
He's my brother's guard,

368
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,950
but my father wants me to marry him.

369
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
General,

370
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,820
as long as you help me save Qimin,

371
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,150
I'll agree to any condition you ask.

372
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,990
And you?

373
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,100
What do you think?

374
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,150
Your father has betrothed you to him,

375
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,950
so you agreed?

376
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,540
What are you saying?

377
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,150
You just said

378
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,100
that to save Shao Qimin,

379
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,580
you'd agree to any condition.

380
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,190
That day at the Uncontrollable Canyon,

381
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,080
I heard there were bandits
attacking caravans.

382
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,770
I wanted to save the caravans
after wiping out the bandits,

383
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
but I was too late,

384
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,500
so the Jun caravan was wiped out.

385
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,150
I know you're upset about this.

386
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,210
You just kept it in your heart.

387
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,870
Now that Shao Qimin
is back in front of you,

388
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,150
it must've reminded you of that.

389
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,740
If you're unhappy,

390
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
you can kill me.

391
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,740
I won't dodge.

392
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,470
General, are you serious?

393
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,500
It was chaotic that day.

394
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,340
The destruction of the Jun caravan
was never my intention.

395
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,390
I didn't use Shao Qimin as leverage

396
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,150
to make you address this issue.

397
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,660
It's just...

398
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,030
Personally,

399
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,540
I want to clear things up.

400
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,060
I don't want there to be revenge
between us.

401
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,470
Even if I kill you now,

402
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,540
the dead can't come back.

403
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,470
If you really want to make amends,

404
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,340
don't let innocent caravans

405
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,060
be wiped out
in the Uncontrollable again.

406
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,030
Okay.

407
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,870
No more caravans

408
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,470
will be wiped out.

409
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,670
I'll begin expanding the clan army

410
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,290
to protect the trade routes.

411
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,260
(Why is Miss Qiluo
so close to Xuan Lie?)

412
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,430
So, you did follow me here

413
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,820
for that Yannan merchant girl.

414
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,540
But Lie is the God of War of Beixuan.

415
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,640
He's the future Wolf Lord.

416
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,470
No one can take people away from him.

417
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,870
You poisoned me?

418
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,910
You could've escaped, but you didn't.

419
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,430
I knew you had other intentions.

420
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,950
So I added a bit of softening powder

421
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,710
to that censer.

422
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,430
What do you want?

423
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,740
I want you to obey.

424
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
Qingming,

425
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,230
you used me to come here for her.

426
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,540
You're mine.

427
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,500
You can't just come and go
as you please.

428
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,470
If you dare neglect me

429
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,580
for that merchant girl,

430
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,820
I'll make sure

431
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,540
she suffers in Beixuan.

432
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,700
(Xuan Mansion)

433
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,620
What's wrong?

434
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,340
Feeling bad?

435
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,500
I heard you were feeling down,

436
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,060
so I came to drink with you.

437
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,430
That's true.

438
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,580
Qingkou told me

439
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,120
she's going to compete
with Miss Jun tomorrow.

440
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,230
Are you helping Qingkou strategize,

441
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,810
or are you helping Miss Jun?

442
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,590
Qiluo asked for my help
for the first time.

443
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,390
She wants to win.

444
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,870
She wants that guard back to her side.

445
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,780
If I help her,
the caravan grudge will be erased.

446
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,630
Isn't that good?

447
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,630
Why are you still upset?

448
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,910
I'm afraid that guard
will take her away.

449
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,470
I still need her

450
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,740
to find Jun Feifan.

451
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,910
Is this really your thought?

452
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,950
Or is it just an excuse?

453
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
Lie,

454
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
your wife

455
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,190
cannot be a foreign woman.

456
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,070
Don't get too deep into this.

457
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,270
How about this?

458
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,670
I'll go with you to the hunting ground.

459
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll keep an eye on Qingkou.

460
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,270
Qimin.

461
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,900
My Lady.

462
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,670
What exactly happened to you?

463
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,990
- How did you...
- My Lady, don't worry.

464
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,830
I'm fine.

465
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,340
Let's leave here.

466
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,430
I'll escort you back home.

467
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,550
No.

468
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,440
I haven't gotten
the black iron crystals.

469
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,730
I can't report back without it.

470
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,910
If we leave now,

471
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,740
all our efforts will be wasted.

472
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,580
No,

473
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,060
I won't let us part again.

474
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,300
Let's leave Xuan Mansion first.

475
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,630
I've found the mine,

476
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,490
but it's in the hands
of the King of Beixuan.

477
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,730
Only Xuan Lie can help me

478
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,060
get the black iron crystal.

479
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,500
My Lady, don't you remember
the massacre of the caravan?

480
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,100
Xuan Lie is devious,
and he's no good person.

481
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,190
You can't stay by his side.

482
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,470
He didn't mean to kill the caravan.

483
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,300
Someone else did it.

484
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,950
Moreover, he promised
to help me save you.

485
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,260
Let it be forgotten.

486
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,300
Forgotten?

487
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,670
In just half a month,

488
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,060
you're already defending him.

489
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,780
What on earth happened to you?

490
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
Lie,

491
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,150
you're drunk. Just stay.

492
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,470
Find somewhere to hide for now.

493
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,940
If the Princess finds you're missing,

494
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,020
she'll come looking for you.

495
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,920
Are you really not leaving?

496
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,990
I'll wait for you to win me over.

497
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,840
Be careful.

498
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,830
Qingkou,

499
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,400
Miss Jun is an honored guest.

500
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,950
You grew up on horseback.

501
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,910
Don't lose your manners.

502
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,340
Lie,

503
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,470
it's a contest.

504
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,710
Even if she is a guest,

505
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,060
I won't go easy on her.

506
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,600
You can't go to the restricted area.

507
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,300
If you shoot a game
within the safe area,

508
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
it counts as a win.

509
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,860
Yes.

510
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,500
When did you become so nagging?

511
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,430
I've heard you're an expert in archery.

512
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,820
Today, I shall learn from you.

513
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,150
Be careful.

514
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,070
My Lady, be careful.

515
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,230
Don't worry.

516
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,740
Who do you think will win?

517
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,710
Miss Qiluo is from Yannan.

518
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,990
The Princess grew up on horseback,

519
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
so she should be better.

520
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,350
That's not necessarily true.

521
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,990
Miss Qiluo is no less than any man

522
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,580
in strategy.

523
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,910
If Miss Jun really wins,

524
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,260
do you think she'll leave
with Shao Qimin?

525
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,300
Keep an eye on them.

526
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,430
Stop them if they enter
the restricted area.

527
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

528
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,990
Why are you here in Beixuan?

529
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,140
To kill you

530
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,390
and avenge Miss Qiluo
and the caravan.

531
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,100
While Qingkou hasn't returned,

532
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,020
you should go.

533
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,100
Leave Beixuan.

534
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,060
Let Miss Qiluo go.

535
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,300
We'll leave immediately.

536
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,060
She stayed by my side willingly.

537
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,540
You can't take her away.

538
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,820
Stop daydreaming.

539
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,100
How can someone brutal like you
keep Miss Qiluo?

540
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,190
Don't think about her.

541
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,260
It's boring to hunt wolves here.

542
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,500
Why not go shoot a wild tiger
in the restricted area?

543
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,950
If you got one, you win.

544
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,390
She's been by my side for so long,

545
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,470
but she never mentioned you.

546
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,100
You overestimated yourself.

547
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,900
Is that so?

548
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,100
Since you're so confident,

549
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,950
why don't you kill me now?

550
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,230
Let's have a bet

551
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,630
to see which of us

552
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,260
matters more to her.

553
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,430
Young Master, the Princess
took Miss Qiluo to the restricted area.

554
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,640
This is the restricted area.

555
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,870
We'll soon see a wild tiger.

556
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,940
Princess,

557
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,260
remember to keep your word.

558
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,300
Lie, you ruined the game.

559
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,860
I won.

560
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,840
Are you so excited about leaving me?

561
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,260
Princess, I just won the game.

562
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Please keep your promise.

563
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,820
Who said you won?

564
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,100
What do you mean?

565
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,990
I'm the Princess of Beixuan.

566
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,060
I do what I want.

567
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,200
Why should I explain to you?

568
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,580
No one can take away

569
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,740
a slave I fancy.

570
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,580
Qingkou,

571
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,790
don't go too far.

572
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,260
Lie, you're threatening me for her.

573
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,910
You even ruined our game midway.

574
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,750
I won't accept this.

575
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,230
Beixuan people should win gracefully

576
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,150
and lose with dignity.

577
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,180
Put down your knife.

578
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,630
She broke the rules.

579
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,730
Why do you only blame me?

580
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,030
That's right.

581
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,150
I did agree.

582
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,100
Don't blame her.

583
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,990
Come over.

584
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,340
Why?

585
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,150
Luo Qi, He Jiyao,

586
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,710
take Shao Qimin back.

587
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

588
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,940
Qingkou.

589
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,790
Lie.

590
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,190
I'll take her back.

591
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,900
Thank you.

592
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,740
I won't leave.

593
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,710
He is my slave. I must take him today.

594
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,430
Are you really willing

595
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,100
to fall out with Lie for Shao Qimin?

596
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,470
- I...
- What?

597
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,740
Apart from Lie, he's the only one

598
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,090
who has accompanied and saved me.

599
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,630
He can't leave.

600
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,890
Don't make things worse.

601
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,990
- The King...
- My brother won't do anything to me.

602
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,070
What about the Queen Mother?

603
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,940
If the Queen Mother
finds out about this,

604
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,540
she'll definitely kill Shao Qimin.

605
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,790
Come back with me.

606
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,180
(Song Residence)

607
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,190
(Jun Feifan)

608
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,390
Father, our opportunity has come.

609
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,230
What do you mean?

610
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,580
Someone sent a letter to Jun Feifan,

611
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,060
saying that Jun Qiluo
was in their hands.

612
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,740
She's been tortured.

613
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,260
They want Jun Feifan to offer himself
within a limited time

614
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,630
at the Uncontrollable,

615
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,060
or Jun Qiluo's head will roll.

616
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,360
Isn't Jun Qiluo ill in Qian City?

617
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,300
How did she end up
at the Uncontrollable?

618
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,990
Well, Jun Qiluo has legs.

619
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,100
She can walk.

620
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,340
You can rewrite the letter

621
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,260
and send it to Uncle.

622
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,990
You naughty boy.

623
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,440
Your uncle will be extremely worried.

624
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,710
Of course, he loves his daughter.

625
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,260
Jun Qiluo is Jun Feifan's sister.

626
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,550
He'll definitely show up.

627
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,780
Jun Feifan somehow

628
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,200
made so many enemies.

629
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,140
We don't have to act then.

630
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,390
No, I have to make sure this time.

631
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,990
I let him escape once.

632
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,500
I can't let him escape a second time.

633
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,340
(Come to the northern forest
for black iron crystals.)

634
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,990
Dongyin.

635
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,540
- My Lady.
- Have you seen Qimin?

636
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,070
When I brought the breakfast,
he was still there.

637
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,740
If I don't return by noon,

638
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,600
tell the general to go
to the northern forest.

639
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,830
My Lady...

640
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,810
The Hunting Event
for Five Clans is near.

641
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,060
The King seeks peace.

642
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,430
I don't want to trouble the King.

643
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,990
I can only have Xi Changkun

644
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,350
give me the mine willingly.

645
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,470
We've had a deep feud with the Xi.

646
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,750
Xi Changkun won't give it up easily.

647
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,140
We'll find a way.

648
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,060
Young Master.

649
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,740
Our people followed those with totems

650
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,180
(Songting Forest)
they entered here.

651
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,020
The forest.

652
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,660
It's located at the border
of the Xuan and Xi,

653
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,150
out of either jurisdiction.

654
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,640
The terrain is extremely complicated.

655
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,020
It's practically a one-way path.

656
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,470
If the evidence is really in the forest,

657
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,280
we need to think of a foolproof plan.

658
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,540
Young Master, a message from the Palace.

659
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,220
The King summons you to meet him now.

660
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,490
Did they say what it's about?

661
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,880
They only said that the Xi Leader
just entered the Palace,

662
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,250
and it was related to some explosion.

663
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,500
Looks like someone lost their patience.

664
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,660
(Xuan Mansion)

665
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,190
General Lie.

666
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,230
General Lie.

667
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,620
Miss Jun is missing.

668
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,940
What?

669
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,620
So is Shao Qimin.

670
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,660
What a bad time.

671
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,310
Young Master,

672
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,270
maybe it's Xi Changkun's plan
to distract us.

673
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,590
Luo Qi,

674
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,790
go report to the Palace.

675
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,790
He Jiyao, follow me.

676
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,630
Yes.

677
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,270
My Lord,

678
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,390
as you planned,

679
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,350
Shao Qimin has gone to the forest

680
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,390
as the letter instructed.

681
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,430
The Yannan merchant girl heard the news

682
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,500
and went there as well.

683
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,900
What about Lie?

684
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,630
As you expected,

685
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,850
General Lie followed Miss Jun
once he found out

686
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,710
she'd gone there.

687
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,750
Lie,

688
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,500
if only you quit the Hunting Event.

689
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,990
Then I won't have to confront you.

690
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,110
My Lord,

691
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,180
does this plan

692
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,830
involve Princess Qingkou?

693
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
Why do you ask?

694
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,580
On my way back,

695
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,830
I saw the Princess
heading to the forest.

696
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Princess Qingkou leaving the Palace

697
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,270
will attract the King
and Queen Mother's attention.

698
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,430
If the King wants to pursue this,

699
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,620
it could be troublesome.

700
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,500
Go instruct them:

701
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,020
Before nightfall,

702
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,180
Xuan Lie must be forced into the forest.

703
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,540
Yes.

704
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,700
Young Master, the forest is ahead.

705
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,100
If we rush in now,
we'll fall into an ambush

706
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,540
and ruin the plan.

707
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,180
The Hunting Event is imminent...

708
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,570
We must find her before nightfall.

709
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,420
Lie.

710
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,430
What are you doing here?

711
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,430
Someone saw my slave enter the forest.

712
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,750
He Jiyao,

713
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,660
take the Princess back.

714
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,750
Yes.

715
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,830
Without him, no one can take me away.

716
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,620
- Princess.
- Qingkou.

717
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,180
Young Master, I'll go after her.

718
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,020
Wait a moment.

719
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,930
Go back to gather troops.

720
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,250
Bring more people who know the terrain.

721
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,270
I'll go find Qingkou.

722
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,420
Yes.

723
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,230
Qimin.

724
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,670
My Lady.

725
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,850
What are you doing here?

726
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,750
I saw a letter in your room.

727
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,870
It said I should come here
for black iron crystals.

728
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,620
It seems Xuan Lie knows
you want the black iron crystal,

729
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,140
so he set a trap to lure me here.

730
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,060
Fine.

731
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,180
He wants to kill me,

732
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,660
and I also want revenge.

733
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,910
It couldn't have been him.

734
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,390
He doesn't need to do this.

735
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,780
Moreover, he doesn't know

736
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,570
what my ultimate goal is
with the crystals.

737
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,750
My Lady,

738
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,020
all your words are about him now.

739
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,910
After spending time with him,

740
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,700
I've come to understand him a little.

741
