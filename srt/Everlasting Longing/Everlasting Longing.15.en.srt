00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
The sun is up.

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
I should return to my tent.

19
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,780
My Lady,

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,620
why did Shao Qimin
take you away last night?

21
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,460
How do you know it was him?

22
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,740
I was worried about you,

23
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,860
so I asked Mr. Luo Qi about it.

24
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,740
He was just worried about me.

25
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
My Lady,

26
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,740
there's something I'm not sure
whether I should say.

27
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,500
Just say it.

28
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,420
My Lady, you're with the general now,

29
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,660
but you're not officially married.

30
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,300
Isn't that unfair to you?

31
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,060
My Lady, if you want to

32
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,580
be with the general forever,

33
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
you should be lawfully married.

34
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,820
As long as we love each other,
that's what matters.

35
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
That's true.

36
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,940
Today, General Lie

37
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,860
didn't send any contraceptive potion,

38
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
which shows how much he cherishes you.

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,700
Contraceptive potion?

40
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,180
Yes.

41
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,620
The general probably

42
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,340
wants you to bear a child first,

43
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,380
then he'll speak with the king.

44
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,380
That would solidify your status.

45
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,380
According to royal rules,

46
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,900
the general is not allowed to father a child

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,220
before his legal wife

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,460
marries in.

49
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,900
Anyway, the general holds a high status,

50
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,900
and given his personality,

51
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,820
he's not the type to stick to rules.

52
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,940
But My Lady,

53
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,740
you are from Yannan.

54
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,500
Even if you have a child,

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm afraid

56
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,980
the royal family might not value it,

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,980
making it difficult to be an heir.

58
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,940
But if you don't mind,
then it doesn't matter.

59
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,260
Dongyin,

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,940
can you do me a favor?

61
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,620
Get me a dose of contraceptives.

62
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,020
Young Master, you seem so happy today.

63
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,180
Care to share the joy with us?

64
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,940
Have you recovered?

65
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,940
Don't worry.

66
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,340
I'm fully recovered.

67
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,620
Great.

68
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,980
Go train the troops

69
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,900
for the upcoming contests.

70
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,500
Young Master,

71
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,940
the Spring Festival is around the corner.

72
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Other clans are roasting lamb
for the celebration.

73
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,380
I mean...

74
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,100
Shall we...

75
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,580
Is the festival coming up so soon?

76
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
Exactly!

77
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,580
During the festival,

78
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,340
the streets will be bustling

79
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,460
with fireworks and juggling acts everywhere.

80
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,180
We still have time before the contest.

81
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,060
How about we go out and have some fun?

82
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,980
Yeah,

83
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,260
everyone wants to celebrate.

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,580
But...

85
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
The contest is coming.

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,140
We can't afford any distractions.

87
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
Young Master,

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,260
Miss Jun has been in Beixuan for a while,

89
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,680
but she hasn't experienced

90
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,860
our festive vibe.

91
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,620
Maybe you should take her around.

92
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,380
Alright.

93
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,460
During the festival,

94
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,460
everyone gets a day off.

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

96
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,580
Dried licorice root,

97
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,660
peach kernel,

98
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,060
Sichuan lovage rhizome...

99
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,980
Isn't she Jun Qiluo's maid?

100
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,300
What's she doing there?

101
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,900
Safflower,

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,740
and Chinese angelica...

103
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Did I drop it on the way here?

104
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,980
Oh, stupid me.

105
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,100
You two can leave now.

106
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

107
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,060
Princess,

108
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,300
it looks like a contraceptive.

109
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,820
Could it be General and Jun Qiluo...

110
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,900
She caused my brother's death.

111
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,100
I haven't avenged her,

112
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,140
yet she wants General to love only her.

113
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,020
Anyway, General still
gives her the contraceptive potion,

114
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,860
so he doesn't fully trust her.

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,220
Jun Qiluo must've

116
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
bewitched the general.

117
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,220
Princess,

118
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
for foreigners marrying in,

119
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,980
having children is crucial.

120
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,940
The general gives her contraceptives,

121
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,020
clearly to prevent her from getting pregnant.

122
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,540
Why don't we take it a step further

123
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,380
to make her infertile?

124
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
What is this?

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Angelica.

126
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,060
It's for the Miss Qiluo's health treatment.

127
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,140
Please give it back,

128
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,780
or Miss Qiluo will be mad at me.

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,820
Stop fooling around, Mr. Luo Qi.

130
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,300
The potion is ready.

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,340
My Lady,

132
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,060
have you made up your mind?

133
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,700
That's okay, Dongyin.

134
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,580
You may leave now.

135
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,780
Alright.

136
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
I'll take my leave then.

137
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,540
It's contraception.

138
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,500
But...

139
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,900
But what?

140
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,860
Celastrol was added.

141
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,460
It will cause infertility.

142
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,940
If the dose is high,
whoever takes it will bleed to death.

143
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,560
What are you doing?

144
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,820
Are you crazy?

145
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,260
It's just contraceptive.

146
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,700
What?

147
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,660
Why?

148
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,060
I'm not ready.

149
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,020
Qiluo,

150
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,980
I know you have concerns,

151
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,180
so I've never pressured you.

152
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,420
I thought you were ready

153
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,820
to face the future with me,

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,940
but now you're telling me you're not.

155
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,060
Why does love need preparation?

156
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,220
We have too many unresolved issues,

157
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,940
and I don't want more to come up.

158
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,180
Issues can be resolved.

159
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,780
But if we really have a child,

160
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,140
do you see it as just another issue?

161
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
Xuan Lie,

162
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
no one knows our feelings
better than you do.

163
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,300
If we were commoners,

164
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,820
I wouldn't have those concerns.

165
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,340
But we are not.

166
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,660
You're going to be the Wolf Lord.

167
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
Do you want the child to be born,

168
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,980
only to see

169
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,100
its father's clan attack its mother's?

170
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,060
This isn't about me being ready or not.

171
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,780
Be honest with yourself.

172
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,100
Are you ready?

173
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,820
I've told you I'll never
lead troops to attack Yannan.

174
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,020
I know you won't.

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,740
But if the king offers

176
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,020
Xuan Clan as a price for you

177
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,940
to attack Yannan,

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,100
will you dare defy his order?

179
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,220
Since neither of us is ready,

180
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,940
how can we bring a new life
to this world?

181
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,380
Xuan Lie,

182
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,140
these issues are right in front of us.

183
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,820
We can't ignore them.

184
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,660
You have your duties,

185
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,380
and I have mine.

186
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
We can't always get what we want.

187
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,900
If I get pregnant,

188
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,260
it won't be good for you, me,

189
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
or the child.

190
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,700
After all,

191
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,540
you don't believe I can protect the townsfolk.

192
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,060
Then why are you staying with me,

193
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,220
helping me with the election

194
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,180
and the trading post?

195
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,980
I trust you.

196
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,700
But I also know

197
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,140
our marriage

198
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,980
is not really up to us.

199
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,460
Before everything is settled,

200
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,300
I dare not take risks.

201
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,780
Qiluo,

202
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,420
I know you have a lot of concerns

203
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,860
and want to be thorough.

204
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,900
If you're not ready for a child,

205
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,700
I certainly won't force you.

206
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,660
But let me ask you one thing.

207
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,580
If I give you my heart

208
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,540
without holding back,

209
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,900
will you do the same for me?

210
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,830
♪Longing lingers in my heart♪

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,540

217
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,100
Qiluo,

218
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,940
how can you always stay so composed?

219
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
I don't need you to bear my children.

220
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,960
I only want your heart.

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,740
Did you poison the potion?

227
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,380
No, I didn't.

228
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,980
How could I do that?

229
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,660
Young Master, it wasn't her.

230
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,500
Princess Xi Jixiu also went to the kitchen.

231
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,740
I wonder...

232
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,620
Bring her here.

233
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,660
- But, Young Master...
- Now!

234
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,860
Yes.

235
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,660
Someone poisoned my potion?

236
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,500
If the general hadn't knocked over the bowl,

237
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,980
I would have harmed you.

238
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,580
I deserve to die.

239
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,780
Please punish me.

240
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,620
It's not your fault.

241
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,660
Be more careful next time.

242
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,500
You two went to the kitchen

243
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,940
at noon, didn't you?

244
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,180
General,

245
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
we were taking a walk back then.

246
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,180
We didn't go to the kitchen.

247
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,300
It wasn't us.

248
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,500
No, it was us.

249
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,500
General, I saw you give her
a contraceptive potion,

250
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,940
so I thought I'd help you

251
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,100
make her infertile forever.

252
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,140
Besides, my brother's death

253
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,660
is definitely tied to her.

254
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,540
I was only avenging him.

255
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,580
What's wrong with that?

256
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
Young Master,

257
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,580
the king summons you for a meeting.

258
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,300
Still hasn't come back, huh?

259
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Princess,

260
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,580
Miss Jun was brought back
by General Lie last night.

261
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,860
I passed by his tent

262
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
and overheard General Lie

263
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,900
scolding Princess Xi Jixiu.

264
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,940
It's said that the Princess
poisoned Miss Jun

265
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,340
to avenge her elder brother.

266
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,460
That businesswoman keeps
bringing trouble to Lie.

267
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,660
Now that she's back,

268
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
you won't be far.

269
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,060
Go spread the word that Jun Qiluo

270
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,900
has been poisoned.

271
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,940
Yes.

272
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,020
Qingming,

273
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
I believe you'll come back to see me.

274
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,860
Greetings, Xu.

275
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,420
I heard you interrogated Xi Jixiu.

276
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,780
Yes,

277
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,420
she's involved in a poisoning case.

278
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm investigating.

279
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,420
Xi Mo just died in the wilderness.

280
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,860
She already suspected you
and that Yannan woman.

281
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,820
Although she acted recklessly,

282
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,900
she had her reasons.

283
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,980
I hope this matter ends here.

284
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,940
If you keep pushing it,

285
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,900
it won't be good
for you or the Xi Clan.

286
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,500
I already knew

287
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
that Xi Mo's death

288
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,340
is somehow linked to you and

289
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,780
that Yannan woman.

290
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,580
Xi Changkun will surely
make a fuss about it.

291
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,220
If you keep pushing it

292
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,620
and interrogating Xi Jixiu,

293
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,860
neither Xuan nor Xi will have any peace.

294
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,860
I know you like that Yannan woman.

295
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,980
That's your personal matter.

296
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,700
But remember,

297
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,940
the Hunting Event is not over.

298
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,740
You haven't secured

299
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,540
the Wolf Lord position and military powers.

300
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,820
Don't let emotions

301
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,300
affect important matters.

302
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,300
Yes,

303
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,860
I understand.

304
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,700
Once you become the Wolf Lord,

305
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,940
help me unite the Five Clans,

306
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,420
and honor the spirits of
my father and Mr. Xuan Shu.

307
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,340
By then, you can investigate the Xi Clan

308
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,260
as much as you want.

309
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,940
Lie,

310
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,540
you are the only one I can trust

311
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,300
and rely on now.

312
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,620
Rest assured, Xu,

313
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,620
I will do my best.

314
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,260
Deal with

315
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
Xi Jixiu's maid

316
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,500
and let it end here.

317
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,380
Yes.

318
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,780
Did you poison my lady?

319
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,500
Where's the antidote?

320
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,340
Give it to me!

321
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,220
The antidote is precious.

322
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,460
I wouldn't waste it on her.

323
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,940
So,

324
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,580
you came to me first

325
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,060
after hearing about it,

326
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,060
not Jun Qiluo.

327
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,380
I must have some place

328
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,140
in your heart, after all.

329
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,420
Ridiculous.

330
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,260
She's fine.

331
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,980
The poisoned contraceptive potion

332
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,940
was knocked over by Lie.

333
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,780
What did you say?

334
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,660
Jun Qiluo is with Lie now.

335
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,100
I know

336
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,380
you really want to kill Lie right now,

337
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,220
don't you?

338
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Qingming,

339
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,300
if you want to keep an eye on Jun Qiluo,

340
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,220
you'll have to stay here as my slave

341
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,620
and be by my side every day.

342
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,300
Cheers!

343
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,300
Come on, come on.

344
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,100
Great. Great.

345
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,420
- Here's to you!
- Cheers!

346
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,940
Cheers!

347
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,980
Good wine!

348
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,620
No wonder it's a gift from the King!

349
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,060
After you, please.

350
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,620
- Drink up!
- Together!

351
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,900
- Cheers!
- Great!

352
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,620
Tonight, I'm hosting this banquet

353
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,740
to share three joys with all of you.

354
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,540
First, today is the Spring Festival,

355
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,100
and it's rare for us
to all gather like this.

356
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,620
Second, the queen has been
by my side for years,

357
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,020
managing the harem
with dedication and order.

358
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,580
Now her son, Yu, has turned seven.

359
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,460
After the Wolf Lord takes office,

360
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,060
I'll have the Grand Tutor
instruct him in governance

361
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,380
and the Wolf Lord teach him
riding and archery.

362
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,980
As the saying goes,

363
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,580
"Civil skills for governance;
martial skills for peace."

364
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,060
With civil and martial ministers,

365
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,340
our sovereignty will stand the test of time.

366
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,420
This arrangement honors
the queen's efforts.

367
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,420
What do you think?

368
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,660
Great choice, Your Majesty!

369
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,300
Third,

370
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,120
the Wolf Lord will assume office soon,

371
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,980
unifying the Five Clans
and safeguarding Beixuan.

372
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,700
A new era of prosperity awaits us!

373
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,140
Good!

374
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,180
Your Majesty,

375
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,500
I toast to you on behalf of my clan.

376
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,980
Young Master,

377
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,060
Miss Jun has been in Beixuan for a while,

378
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,580
but she hasn't experienced

379
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,620
our festive vibe.

380
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,380
Maybe you should take her around.

381
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,700
Try this.

382
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,020
Lie, what's on your mind?

383
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,700
You seem upset.

384
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,500
But why do you look the same?

385
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,420
I don't like it here.

386
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,020
Look at those ministers,
fawning with fake smiles.

387
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,260
They don't even mean it.

388
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,700
Don't you find this banquet boring too?

389
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,260
Let's go to the city.

390
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,620
It's much more fun there.

391
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,460
- Let's go.
- Qingkou.

392
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,780
Where are you going?

393
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,820
Mother,

394
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
I'm feeling a bit tired.

395
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,500
I'd like to go back and rest.

396
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,660
I'll have someone send you back.

397
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,340
My tent isn't far from here.

398
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,420
Don't worry, Mother.

399
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,180
Rest assured.

400
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,740
I'll look after the Princess.

401
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
I'll take my leave.

402
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,980
Let's go.

403
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
Xu,

404
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,660
I have something urgent,

405
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,740
so I'll take my leave.

406
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,300
Today is the Spring Festival,

407
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,740
rare for us all to gather.

408
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,020
Can't you stay longer?

409
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,330
I can't, Xu.

410
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
The contest is in a few days.

411
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,340
I need to get prepared.

412
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,940
Perhaps Lie wishes to celebrate

413
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,980
with the Xuan soldiers.

414
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,860
King, just let him go.

415
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,820
Fine, you may go.

416
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,660
Yes.

417
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,820
Qingkou.

418
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,220
Lie,

419
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,540
are you going to the city too?

420
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,140
I'll worry if you go alone.

421
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,700
Qingming will protect me. Don't worry.

422
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,780
If you're worried,

423
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,900
why not go with her?

424
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,940
If you wish to stay here,

425
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,900
bring the Princess back before midnight.

426
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,380
Lie,

427
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,100
if Qingming fails to protect me,

428
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,420
you'll help me deal with him, right?

429
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,460
Of course.

430
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,540
Let's go.

431
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:18,220
(Spirit Tablet of Xi Mo, Beloved Son)

432
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,860
Mo was at least the Queen Mother's nephew,

433
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,860
and the king's cousin.

434
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,660
He just passed away,

435
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,020
and they're having
a Spring Festival banquet.

436
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,180
The royal family is cold-hearted.

437
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,020
Xiu,

438
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,260
don't say such things in public.

439
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
Father,

440
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,580
I miss Mo.

441
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,780
Father,

442
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,860
please avenge him.

443
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,980
Scent sachets for sale!

444
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
So beautiful!

445
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,500
Have some food.

446
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
When will Father wake up?

447
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,220
When will my brother come back?

448
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,340
Xiukun,

449
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,020
I really miss him.

450
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,220
Today's the Spring Festival. Don't cry.

451
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,620
He will surely return safely

452
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,580
before the business conference.

453
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,540
Father's condition has improved.

454
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,100
He can take medicine normally.

455
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,580
I believe he'll
regain consciousness soon.

456
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,300
Everything will be fine.

457
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700
Let's eat.

458
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
Xiukun,

459
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,260
didn't you just tell me not to cry?

460
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,620
Aren't you supposed to be at the banquet?

461
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,660
Why are you here?

462
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,460
The banquet happens every year.

463
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,300
It's quite dull.

464
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,060
But why is your tent

465
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,900
so cold and quiet?

466
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,100
Where is Dongyin?

467
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,420
I'm thinking of my family.

468
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,260
It's warm,

469
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,500
not cold at all.

470
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,380
I know you're nostalgic.

471
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
It's a festival.

472
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,740
Let's have something different.

473
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,620
It might cheer you up.

474
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,140
Young Master

475
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,540
did take Miss Jun to the city.

476
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,180
How about we...

477
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,740
Let's go!

478
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,820
Great! One more round!

479
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,740
- Well done!
-Great!

480
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
Well done!

481
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
Wow, that's impressive.

482
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,740
This is really fun.

483
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,900
- Well done!
-Great!

484
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,740
General, you were
pretty angry with me earlier.

485
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,220
I thought you'd give me a cold shoulder.

486
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,680
I don't like the silent treatment,

487
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,100
and the Spring Festival

488
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,940
is meant for family.

By the way,

500
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,140
Xi Mo is dead.

501
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,820
Xi Changkun must hate us even more now.

502
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,780
Be cautious these days.

503
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,860
You're telling me to be cautious,

504
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,300
but you send everyone away

505
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,580
and bring me to such a crowded place.

506
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,900
What's your plan?

507
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,100
So?

508
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,620
Are you, the clever Miss Jun,

509
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,840
worried I'd sell you off?

With me here,

514
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,020
I won't let anyone hurt you.

515
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Any progress on Mr. Xuan Shu's case?

516
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,140
Have Xi's former soldiers been settled?

517
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,700
We can reopen the old case
once it's over.

518
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,740
Xi's former soldiers are safe
at Xuan Mansion.

519
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,100
The lions are here! Look!

520
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,460
They're jumping around.

521
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,980
- So lively!
- Yes, indeed.

522
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,300
They're swinging their heads.

this puppy looks just like you.

526
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,100
Your eyes are all teary.

527
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,900
I was drawn to your eyes at first.

528
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,220
Boring.

529
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,700
Qingming,

530
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,580
I like this puppy.

531
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,820
It's my festival gift to you.

532
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,900
Be careful.

533
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,460
Sir,

534
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,220
get your wife a sugar painting.

535
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,740
This way.

536
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,740
I'll take this one.

537
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,060
Didn't expect a sugar painting
could have a wolf design.

538
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,780
Why this one though?

539
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,780
There are so many cute ones over there.

540
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,000
Ma'am, you may not know

541
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,460
that wolves are pack animals.

542
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,220
They are resilient and brave.

543
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
More importantly,

544
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
they are loyal in love.

545
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,060
So I guess that's
this gentleman's intention.

546
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,100
The valley where we met is called

547
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,420
Wolf Smoke Valley.

548
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,500

Go, go, go!

549
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,300

551
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,830
Bite it!

552
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,420
- Grand General!
- Stop it.

553
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,060
Let's go find young master and Miss Jun.

554
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,140
He'd love to spend more time alone with her.

555
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,700
Leave them alone. Cheer for it with me.

556
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,540
Go, go!

557
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,500
Bite it! Bite it!

558
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,100
- We need to stay by their side.
- Go!

559
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,940
Go, go, go!

560
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,860
- Luo Qi!
- Go!

561
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,220
He Jiyao!

562
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,020
Every time I go out with you,

563
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,260
you always act so boring!

564
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,100
You blockhead.

565
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
Bite it! Bite it!

566
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,740
It... It wins!

567
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,020
It wins!

568
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,140
Hey,

569
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
please take a look.

570
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,940
Everything here is top-quality.

571
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,500
What? Something wrong
with this jade pendant?

572
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,940
I'm just checking if it's solid

573
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,980
or if it's hollow.

574
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,860
If you like it, buy it.

575
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,420
Don't listen to the seller.

576
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,940
His stuff isn't worth anything.

577
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,380
I have this. That's enough.

578
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,380
I embroidered it myself.

579
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,540
I want to give you
a handmade New Year's gift.

580
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,340
Are you all right?

581
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,680
Tonight, the king's made it clear

582
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,420
that he plans to name Prince Yu as an heir.

583
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,900
Zhizhou,

584
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,620
we don't have much time left.

585
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,980
I know.

586
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,540
I've spent as much time with the king

587
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,460
as the queen has,

588
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,580
but he only has eyes for her.

589
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,380
He never even glances at me.

590
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,220
Even for the heir,

591
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
he's never considered Yi at all.

592
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,580
Are you upset for Yi,

593
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,460
or for yourself?

594
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,220
You love him,

595
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,060
but what about me?

596
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,300
Zhizhou,

597
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,340
Yi and I must rely on the king

598
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,700
for the glory and favor we have.

599
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,140
For Yi's sake, I must accept him.

600
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,860
But whether the king favors Yi or not,

601
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,100
Queen Mother will never allow

602
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,940
a child of foreign blood to become an heir.

603
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,060
The future of Yi and I

604
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
will rely on you.

605
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,780
Only if you become the Wolf Lord

606
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,220
will Yi have a chance at the throne,

607
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,500
and I'll gain my freedom.

608
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,500
Otherwise, it'll all be in vain.

609
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,860
Don't you think
you're asking for too much?

610
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,500
What do you want me to do?

611
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,100
Should I drive the king out

612
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,220
when he comes to my place?

613
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,220
He finally brought me to this event,

614
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,460
how could I turn him down?

615
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,900
Zhizhou,

616
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,020
whether it's for myself

617
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,140
or for Yi,

618
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,500
in the palace, I have no choice
but to keep going.

619
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,540
If I don't, neither of us will make it.

620
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,380
I'm sorry.

621
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,180
Zhizhou,

622
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,140
promise me

623
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,700
that no matter what,

624
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,740
you'll become the Wolf Lord.

625
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,260
Look!

626
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,460
- Pretty!
- It flies high.

627
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,380
I want to release one.

628
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
Miss,

629
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,100
if you have a wish,
write it on the lantern.

630
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,180
Let the lantern carry your wish

631
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,140
to the heavens,

632
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,340
and it will surely come true.

633
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,980
But I already have everything I want.

634
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,380
Nothing more to ask for.

635
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,700
In your lifetime,

636
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,140
things don't always go as wished.

637
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,780
There are things or people

638
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,660
you long for but can never have.

639
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,740

look!

643
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,420
That's the lantern I released.

644
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,700
My wish will definitely come true,

645
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,620
