=Episode 29=

17
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,920
- Please take a look.
- Why did you ask that servant

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,680
to pay attention to the room
with the fewest guards in the mansion?

19
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,550
Song Wei is the Grand Chancellor

20
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,710
and doesn't need power.

21
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,410
If he had indeed colluded Xi Changkun,

22
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,170
what do you think
the reason would've been?

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,040
He wants money.

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,740
If he collects money
as the Grand Chancellor,

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,150
he'd be suspected of bribery.

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,410
So, he used Zheng Yuan's name
to open shops

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,400
to gather money secretly.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,100
He wouldn't want
too many people to know

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,060
where the money is kept.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,310
Thus, the most unsafe place

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,750
is actually the safest.

32
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,150
Are you saying

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,840
he hides the money
in the most unsafe room

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,310
to divert attention?

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,960
What's your next move?

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,150
I'll do what you did
when you came to Yannan

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,240
and act before reporting.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,680
You were so decisive when you left.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
If I hadn't done that,

40
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,470
how could I see you again?

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,630
Sorry about that.

42
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,420
(Jun Mansion)

43
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,870
Miss Qiluo, the Chancellor is here.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
The master instructed me
to wait for you here.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,710
Recently, everyone's been talking

46
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,840
about the Beixuan spy.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,120
General Lie, you'd better not go in.

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,280
Why has he suddenly come?

49
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,190
The Chancellor heard
the master's legs hadn't recovered,

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,910
so he sent the physician to check.

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,310
Miss Qiluo,

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,230
I'll go in first.

53
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,100
He knows we've traced to Zheng Yuan.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,910
His visit must be more
than just a casual check-up.

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Be very careful.

56
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,870
Physician,

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
it's taken such a long time,
yet nothing worked.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,630
Let's stop today.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,470
Don't rush it.

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,190
The longer the diagnosis,
the clearer the cause of the illness.

61
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,400
Chancellor.

62
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,910
You...

63
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,470
Greetings, Chancellor.

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Chengliu,

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,870
you're so fortunate.

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,310
I've long heard your eldest daughter

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,240
resembles Feifan the most.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,870
Now that I see her,

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
it's indeed true.

70
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,800
Father, what are you doing?

71
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,460
Well...

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,070
Your father's leg injury
has not healed yet,

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
so I've invited this physician,

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,000
who specializes
in treating limb injuries,

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
to take a look.

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,950
How's it going?

77
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,360
It's still unclear.

78
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,190
I'm afraid my legs can't be cured,

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,390
so let's stop today.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,120
Thank you, Chancellor,
for remembering me.

81
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,510
Look at you.

82
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,630
If there's even a slight chance,

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,430
don't give up easily.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,750
Thank you for your kindness.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
We've consulted many physicians,

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,630
but the results were all similar.

87
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,110
Father.

88
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,110
Father, are you okay?

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Let me examine him.

90
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,710
Well.

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,390
Since you insist,

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
let's stop today.

93
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,360
I'll come visit another time.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,080
Sure.

95
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,190
Go see the Chancellor off.

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Yes.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Chancellor, this way.

98
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,560
What have you found out?

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,750
It's a sign of pregnancy.

100
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,070
I didn't guess wrong.

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
You,

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,680
come with me to the Palace
to meet the King.

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
Yes.

104
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,340
(Jun Mansion)

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,630
If the Chancellor tells the King

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,870
that Qiluo is pregnant,

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,290
then our family will be guilty

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,720
of deceiving the King.

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Sorry, Father.

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,920
I underestimated the situation.

111
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,920
I thought I could come up
with a perfect strategy

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
before telling the King.

113
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,950
I'm going to the Palace
to meet your King now.

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Why?

115
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
To turn yourself in?

116
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,270
I'll tell him

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,270
that I forced you,

118
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,850
and it wasn't your choice.

119
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,690
What nonsense are you talking about?

120
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,040
But what the general said
does make sense.

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,630
Rather than waiting here
for the King's summon,

122
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,750
we might as well speak the truth

123
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,390
to ease the King's doubts.

124
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll also do everything

125
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,750
to protect you.

126
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,390
That's a problem we can't avoid.

127
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,480
Beixuan and Yannan
are having peace talks,

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,750
and there's no rule
against intermarriage.

129
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,070
If we swear in front of the King

130
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,470
that we'll never attack Yannan,

131
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,630
perhaps it will ease his concerns.

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,680
Hurry up.

133
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,110
Hurry.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
The rest, hurry and follow.

135
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,160
You go over there.

136
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,710
Young Master,

137
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,980
our people have been stationed
throughout the forest,

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,240
waiting for your command.

139
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,230
No rush.

140
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,070
We only have a few hundred soldiers.

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,920
Compared to the garrison
in the Royal City,

142
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,100
we have no chance of winning.

143
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,070
Contact some loyal old generals
from our clan.

144
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,200
If they're willing
to continue following me,

145
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,900
reveal your identity and gather them.

146
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,390
If they're unwilling,

147
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,240
remember to protect your identity.

148
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,520
Yes.

149
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,390
The forest here is relatively safe.

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
We can stay here long-term.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,570
Find some men who are familiar
with the terrain,

152
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,390
make a map for defense and attack,

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,960
and give everyone a copy.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
Yes.

155
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
My Lord,

156
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll make the defense map.

157
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,630
I'll live or die with you.

159
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,200
Who told you to clean here?

160
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,850
Chancellor, please forgive me.

161
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,150
Butler Zheng used to clean the study.

162
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,790
Since his death, no one has come here.

163
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I came to clean

164
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,810
as a way to repay his kindness.

165
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,270
I'll spare you this time.

166
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,440
Don't come here again.

167
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Yes.

170
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,600
He just came back. Where's he now?

171
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,790
Master, Miss Qiluo,

172

General Lie, and Qimin

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,750
went to the Palace together
at noon today.

174
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
They went to the Palace together?

175
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,870
Why would Lie go to the Palace?

176
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Take a look.

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,700
I hope your business prospers.

180

My young master hasn't returned.

181

To avoid being late,

182
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,830
I brought the gift early.

183
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Thank you.

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
you came just in time.

Come here.

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,590
(Clouds Rest)
Is this in the right place?

189
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,970
(I have to return to Beixuan.)

190
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,660
(I can't be a live-in husband.)

191
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,910
Is it the right place?

192
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,350
Where are you going?

193
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,630
I...

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,030
Good thing you're fast.

195
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Is this thing

196
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
very important to you?

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,040
Of course.

198
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,820
This is the Seven Star Formation,

199
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,350
which brings wealth and prosperity.

200
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,870
Placing it in Xiukun's workshop

201
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,490
is to wish her abundant wealth.

202
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,660
This is superstition.

203
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,510
It's a good wish for merchants.

204
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,270
Merchants in Yannan place this at home.

205
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
What do you know?

206
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,750
Try hitting me again.

207
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,230
You...

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Why do you always do things

209
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,390
that are so annoying?

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
What's wrong with me?

211
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,020
What's wrong with you?

212
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,130
You want your husband to look good,

213
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,030
protect your family,

214
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,590
and marry into your family.

215
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,690
The first two are fine,

216
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,630
but the last one...

217
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,110
No way.

218
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,780
Who asked you to meet those standards?

219
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
I never said it was you.

220
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
What?

221
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,630
It isn't me?

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
Who else could it be?

223
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,630
If you didn't mean me,

224
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,710
who else could it be?

225
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,110
I...

226
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,470
Luo Qi.

227
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,030
It must be me.

228
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
What happened?

229
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,390
Take me to find He Jiyao.

230
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,440
We're going to the Palace.

231
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
Lie and Qingming are in danger.

232
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,600
How can He Jiyao and I

233
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,600
enter the Yannan Palace?

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,920
There's no time for explanations.

235
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,790
The Beixuan envoy hasn't left.
I'll find him.

236
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,300
Let's meet outside the Palace. Quick!

237
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,870
Okay.

238
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll consider the last condition.

239
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,320
You can't think about others now.

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
It seems that the Beixuan spy

241
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,480
and the substitution were fake.

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,160
But you

243
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,630
did help Xuan Lie become the Wolf Lord

244
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,480
and get pregnant

245
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,510
with his child.

246
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
Yes.

247
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,750
You knew all of this.

248
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,030
No wonder the investigation
into the Beixuan spy

249
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,960
has taken so long to yield results.

250
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,470
I am guilty.

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,510
Good for all of you.

252
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,070
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

253
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,840
Though you're no longer the Wolf Lord,

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
you're still a Beixuan general.

255
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,720
At such a crucial time for peace talks,

256
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
you rashly entered Yannan.

257
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,630
How can I know the true intentions
of the King of Beixuan?

258
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
It was improper of me,

259
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,240
but I hope that Yannan

260
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,490
won't doubt our sincerity
in seeking peace.

261
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,890
My King has repeatedly
advised me to leave,

262
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,870
but

263
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,070
I found someone I once lost,

264
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,240
so I don't want to leave.

265
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,870
That's why I've stayed in Yannan
a little longer.

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,630
With her special status,

267
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,550
there's no outcome between you and her.

268
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,630
Do you know that?

269
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,920
Before, Qiluo and I

270
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,910
had our own responsibilities.

271
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,270
Whether in Beixuan or in Yannan,

272
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,540
this remains an unsolvable problem.

273
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,390
This started because of me.

274
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,470
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

275
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,120
But

276
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,080
I can't give Qiluo up.

277
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Your Majesty,

278
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,360
I disregarded your orders
and made a grave mistake.

279
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,870
I'm willing to be punished.

280
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,980
It's crucial for the peace talks

281
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,200
between Beixuan and Yannan now.

282
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
General Lie is a Beixuan noble.

283
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,790
If anything happens to him,

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,120
it could lead to war.

285
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,550
It would be a loss for all.

286
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,350
Your Majesty...

287
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
Enough.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Here's the deal:

289
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,120
I'll give you three days

290
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
to leave Yannan immediately,

291
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,510
and I'll overlook the past.

292
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,670
Thank you for your mercy.

293
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
But you,

294
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,200
as the Commander
of the Royal Surveillance

295
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,680
who works for the royal family,

296
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,270
have disobeyed orders multiple times.

297
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,550
How should I deal with you?

298
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,030
You can't deal with him.

299
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,940
Your Majesty,

300
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,010
the Beixuan envoy
has urgent matters to discuss,

301
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,080
but Princess Qingkou rashly barged in.

302
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,030
This is Princess Qingkou of Beixuan.

303
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,600
You're Princess Qingkou?

304
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,110
That's right.

305
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,550
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

306
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,000
Qingkou was eager to save Shao Qimin.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,220
She didn't mean to be impolite.

308
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,150
You're the Princess

309
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,750
who married Shao Qimin on her behalf?

310
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
He got lucky and married a Princess.

311
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,030
This marriage was too childish.

312
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,960
It doesn't count.

313
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,280
Though I was a substitute bride,

314
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,620
I've done the ceremony with him,

315
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,640
lived in the same house,
and shared the same bed.

316
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,870
Why doesn't it count?

317
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Now he's my legitimate husband.

318
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,390
He's a noble now.

319
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,590
If you don't want
to jeopardize the peace talks,

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,630
you can't kill him.

321
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,270
Are you saying I have to send
a betrothal gift

322
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,600
to the King of Beixuan?

323
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,360
Enough. I have matters
to discuss with Shao Qimin.

324
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,600
You may leave now.

325
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,490
Young Master, the envoy
can't enter the Palace with generals.

326
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,080
Luo Qi and I can only wait outside.

327
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Is everything okay?

328
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,360
Send a letter to the King.

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,750
I need a valid reason to stay in Yannan.

330
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,200
Make it quick.

331
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,960
Yes.

332
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,110
You still betrayed me.

333
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,070
I know you came here today

334
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,110
with the resolve to die.

335
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,280
If Princess Qingkou hadn't saved you,

336
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,810
you wouldn't even need to wait
for the poison to take effect.

337
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,480
You'd have died today.

338
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,190
I understand.

339
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Do you know

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
why I had to send Xuan Lie
away from Yannan?

341
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,720
Because I can't let go

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,680
of the child inside Jun Qiluo.

343
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,410
But you just promised
to spare the Jun family.

344
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,830
I only promised to spare Jun Qiluo.

345
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,000
Her child carries Beixuan blood.

346
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,790
If Jun Qiluo

347
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,110
teaches the child the Baigong crafts,

348
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,590
it will lead to endless trouble.

349
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,800
However,

350
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,310
there's another way

351
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,510
to save her child.

352
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,750
Kill Xuan Lie.

353
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,350
Let Miss Qiluo's child
belong to Yannan entirely.

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
So, you want to send Xuan Lie away.

355
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,270
You want to kill him outside Yannan.

356
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,480
Yes.

357
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,720
You're very clever.

358
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,110
Now, there are two paths:

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,510
Either kill Xuan Lie

360
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,830
or kill Jun Qiluo's child.

361
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,220
(Wind Pavilion)

362
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,220
I'm going to the Uncontrollable
tomorrow morning?

363
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,860
The King wants you to evaluate

364
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,080
the feasibility of establishing
the trading post there.

365
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,960
He still has doubts
about the trading post?

366
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,360
The King didn't elaborate.

367
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,920
Perhaps it's because the Uncontrollable

368
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
is in a turbulent state

369
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,480
and he's lacking confidence.

370
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,960
But the King had warned me

371
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,550
not to leave the capital.

372
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,350
The King's lifted your restraint order.

373
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,710
The King repeatedly instructed it
to be done in secret.

374
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Now, the Juns' business
stands at the top of Yannan.

375
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,350
Perhaps, apart from you,

376
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,830
the King has no better candidate.

377
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,590
Did the King keep you there

378
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,550
just to discuss this?

379
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,160
As the King ordered,

380
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,440
I shall make the trip.

381
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
My Lady, let me.

382
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,950
Xuan Lie,

383
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,030
will you come with us tomorrow?

384
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,910
Yes.

385
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,910
That's good.

386
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,150
My Lady,

387
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,350
now you're finally willing
to lower your guard

388
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,440
and seek protection.

389
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,480
Even if I'm not by your side
in the future,

390
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,750
I can rest easy.

391
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,780
(Peaceful Nation)

392
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,540
Why are you still standing there?

393
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,390
Come in.

394
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,110
Qingming,

395
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,840
come in.

396
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
Come in.

397
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,560
Sit.

398
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,430
Take a look.

399
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,680
I made all of this.

400
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,070
No need to wait for me.

401
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,680
If you're hungry, you can eat first.

402
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,790
I just don't like
the way the food was placed.

403
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,920
I wasn't waiting for you.

404
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,720
I don't like ginger.

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,130
What's wrong with you today?

406
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,430
Why are you being so accommodating?

407
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,270
I'm your husband,

408
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,270
so I naturally accommodate you.

409
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,040
You used the blood medicine to save me.

410
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
From now on,

411
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,030
I'll listen to you.

412
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,720
The ginger slice is too spicy

413
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
and not good for your recovery.

414
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't eat it.

415
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,720
Didn't you just say

416
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,270
that you'll listen to me?

417
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,270
How about we go back
to Beixuan in a few days?

418
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,830
If you don't like the Palace,

419
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,790
I'll have my brother build us
a new house

420
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,160
just for the two of us.

421
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,350
How about it?

422
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,430
Okay.

423
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,070
When are we leaving?

424
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,880
Wait until tomorrow.

425
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,680
I need to finish one last task.

426
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
Okay.

427
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,830
When you return,

428
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,000
I have a gift for you.

429
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,800
Hurry and eat.

430
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,770
The food's getting cold.

431
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,880
Eat now.

432
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,090
♪As the veil lifts,
our love comes to an end♪

433
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,400
♪Scattered far away, with you not there♪

434
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,880
After this forest is the city gate.

435
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,160
You're pregnant.

436
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,240
You shouldn't be out.

437
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
The King's orders must be carried out.

438
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,980
(Wisdom and Grace)

439
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,270
What time is it now?

440
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,110
It's the Chen hour.

441
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
Where is Shao Qimin?

442
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,400
Mr. Shao left early with Miss Qiluo.

443
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,030
Jun Qiluo?

444
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
Do you know where they went?

445
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't know.

446
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,000
When are we leaving?

447
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,640
Wait until tomorrow.

448
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,350
I need to finish one last task.

449
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,750
Why did he bring Jun Qiluo along
for this task?

450
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,510
(My Lady, forgive me.)

451
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,070
(This is the only way to keep you safe.)

452
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,750
(For the rest of the journey,)

453
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,030
(let Xuan Lie continue to protect you.)

454
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,200
Princess, they're going
to the Uncontrollable

455
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,460
to carry out the task
assigned by the King of Yannan.

456
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,370
They'll be back soon.

457
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,710
Let's go back and wait for news.

458
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,350
Shut up.

459
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
Qingming is my husband.

460
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,660
I want to go with him.

461
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,550
Commander An
of the Military Office.

462
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,230
The King must've been
long suspecting me of this.

463
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,930
(It's already the Si hour.)

464
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,640
(I'm afraid I can't fulfill
my promise to her.)

465
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,680
The Commander of the Surveillance
has disobeyed royal orders,

466
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,270
releasing a key talent.

467
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,920
He shall be executed.

468
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,750
Kill him!

469
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,750
Is the carriage going too fast?

470
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Are you feeling unwell?

471
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't worry. I'm not that delicate.

472
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,870
Where's Qimin?

473
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
Let's go back. Hurry!

474
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,630
Chase them.

475
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,680
Let's return to the city.

476
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,560
Qingming.

477
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,870
Why?

478
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,110
Why did you lie to me?

479
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,830
You promised me

480
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,640
we'd go back to Beixuan together.

481
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,310
I won't lie to you again.

482
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,960
We'll leave Yannan together.

483
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,070
Let's leave Yannan,

484
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,830
buy a house for just the two of us,

485
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
and live together forever.

486
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
Qingming,

487
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
I've made the antidote.

488
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,590
As long as you take it,

489
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,670
you'll be fine.

490
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,840
Hurry and eat.

491
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,950
Eat.

492
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,510
Why won't you eat?

493
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,750
You'll be fine if you eat it.

494
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,110
Hurry and eat it.

495
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,110
Give this

496
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,830
to Miss Qiluo for me.

497
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,920
The King...

498
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,200
The King won't spare them.

499
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,510
You're still thinking about Jun Qiluo?

500
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,750
What does she have to do with me?

501
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,270
Qingkou,

502
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
don't be willful.

503
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,070
Only you can help them now.

504
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,550
You're willing to die for her.

505
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,000
What about me?

506
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,960
Have you thought about me at all?

507
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,240
Qimin.

508
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,790
I'm sorry.

509
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,640
In my next life...

510
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,510
Qingming!

511
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,920
Qingming!

512
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,430
Qimin.

513
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,550
- Go away.
- Qimin.

514
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,230
- Don't touch him.
- Qimin.

515
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,830
How could this happen?

516
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,070
Qimin.

517
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,910
Go away.

518
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,920
Qimin.

519
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Qingming, get up.

520
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,350
You can't die.

521
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
Get up.

522
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,440
You promised me
we'd return to Beixuan together.

523
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,000
You can't go back on your word.

524
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,590
Get up.

525
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,160
Qingming,

526
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,270
I order you to get up.

527
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,920
Qingming, I'll take you back to Beixuan.

528
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,040
Qingming,

529
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,510

The urgent letter from Commander An.

544
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
Your Majesty,

545
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,000
Jun Qiluo didn't leave.

546
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,920
She's back at the Jun Mansion.

547
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,310
Commander Shao disobeyed your orders

548
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,790
and died.

549
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,000
What a waste.
I've trained him for so many years.

550
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,240
Why didn't he listen to me?

551
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,030
Commander Shao took an extreme step.

552
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,240
He wanted to sacrifice himself

553
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,270
to protect Jun Qiluo
and the Beixuan Wolf Lord.

554
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,070
But Jun Qiluo is very calculating.

555
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,880
She knows

556
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,310
that only by returning
can she protect everyone.

557
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,110
Your Majesty,

558
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,400
what should we do with Jun Qiluo

559
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,440
and the Jun family now?

560
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,590
Since Jun Qiluo is willing to return,

561
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,480
it means she's still loyal to Yannan.

562
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,310
Jun Qiluo and the Jun family

563
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,400
are still useful to Yannan.

564
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
But

565
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,550
Shao Qimin's death will only strengthen

566
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,030
Jun Qiluo's resolve to be with Xuan Lie.

567
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,000
I can no longer break them up.

568
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,110
I must think

569
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,270
of another way to solve this problem.

570
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,190
Qiluo,

571
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,190
have some congee.

572
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,760
How is Mr. Jun?

573
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,920
Since Qimin's body was brought back,

574
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,960
Father hasn't said a word.

575
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,800
The coroner examined the body

576
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,670
and said the internal organs were...

577
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,440
Father was heartbroken.

578
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,940
He didn't even eat dinner.

579
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,920
Only after the coffin was sealed
did he go to rest in his room.

580
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
By the way,

581
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,280
a servant of the Chancellor came earlier

582
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,150
to deliver a message.

583
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,880
He said he found the result you wanted.

584
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,110
As you weren't back,

585
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,500
he drew this map

586
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,340
(Study)

587
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,110
and asked me to give you this.

588
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,420
(Study)

589
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,800
Xuan Lie,

590
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,790
if Song Wei hadn't told the King

591
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,110
about my pregnancy,

592
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,110
Qimin wouldn't have died, right?

593
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,990
Qingming...

594
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,430
Qingming...

595
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,390
Qingming...

596
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,990
Qingming.

597
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,030
Qingming.

598
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,480
I'm back.

599
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,480
Have you completed the task?

600
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,320
Did you get hurt?

601
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,400
I've been waiting for you.

602
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,880
Let's go back to Beixuan.

603
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,260
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

604
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,060
(100% Gold, Xi Clan)

605
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,960
This is a gold bar from the Xi Clan.

606
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,320
The diagram of the Baigong's heir.

607
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,660
(Three-Arrow Crossbow Diagram)

608
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,140
(Grand Chancellor's Mansion)

609
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,910
Chancellor,

610
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,520
you're going to court, right?

611
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,640
Please.

612
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,960
You incited the King of Yannan

613
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,070
and wanted him to kill us,

614
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,590
but you didn't expect us
to return alive.

615
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,190
The King cares most
about the Baigong's heir.

616
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,710
Even if I hadn't told him,

617
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,710
the King would've never let you

618
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,710
keep the child inside you.

619
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,920
Now that you're here,

620
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,230
as an important official of Yannan,

621
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,000
I will help the King
relieve his worries.

622
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,760
Guards,

623
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,030
seize them.

624
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,470
Guards.

625
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,160
Guards!

626
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,510
No need to call them.

627
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,840
Your people have been surrounded
by the Surveillance.

628
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,030
Jun Qiluo, you're very bold.

629
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
You're not an official,

630
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,060
yet you mobilized the secret guards
without permission

631
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,510
and intruded on my mansion.

632
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,190
It'll implicate your entire family.

633
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,630
I'm already here,

634
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,460
so I must be well-prepared.

635
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,380
(Royal Surveillance)

636
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,620
(Royal Surveillance)

637
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
Chancellor,

638
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,760
our grudges should be settled now.

639
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,470
Your Majesty,

640
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,320
these were found
in the Chancellor's secret cabinet.

641
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,590
The sheet on your desk

642
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,440
is the first blueprint I designed.

643
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,420
The Chancellor secretly copied them

644
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
and traded with the Xi Clan of Beixuan.

645
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,910
These gold bars are all marked
with the Xi character.

646
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
They belong to the Xi Clan.

647
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,360
After the Chancellor got them,

648
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,730
he dared not use them in Yannan,

649
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,630
so he hid them in his secret cabinet.

650
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,440
Your Majesty, please view them.

651
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,200
Your Majesty,

652
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,800
I am innocent!

653
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,480
As the Chancellor,

654
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,920
you neglected the safety of the people

655
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,000
and traded weapons with Beixuan.

656
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,920
Do you deserve my trust?

657
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,200
Your Majesty,

658
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,150
these are my butler
Zheng Yuan's belongings.

659
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,550
It has nothing to do with me!

660
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,510
Chancellor, you're quite eloquent.

661
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,810
How can you use a dead man
to absolve yourself?

662
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,640
Zheng Yuan was your butler.

663
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,150
Without your permission,

664
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,670
how could he hide his items
in your secret chamber?

665
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,990
Your Majesty,

666
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,730
Zheng Yuan secretly traded weapons

667
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,880
with the Xi Clan behind my back.

668
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,760
When I discovered it,
it was already too late.

669
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,670
I covered up his actions out of respect

670
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,000
for the years he served me.

671
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,000
I planned to report this to you

672
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,760
after this incident,

673
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,640
but he...

674
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,710
If I'm at fault,

675
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,590
it's my fault for shielding a criminal.

676
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,480
Your Majesty, please punish me.

677
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
Chancellor, you're indeed eloquent.

678
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,510
Zheng Yuan is dead,

679
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,570
with no one to testify,

680
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,000
so you place all the blame

681
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,230
on him.

682
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,120
Your Majesty.

683
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,950
Your Majesty.

684
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,880
She's pregnant
with the Beixuan Wolf Lord's child.

685
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,110
She is a traitor to Yannan.

686
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,800
Now she's twisting the truth,

687
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,470
slandering me,

688
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,870
and meddling in state affairs.

689
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,320
Who knows what she's up to?

690
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,190
You're indeed a master of words.

691
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,480
At this point,
you're still trying to frame me.

692
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,510
Zheng Yuan served you for many years,

693
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,320
and he left behind a backup plan.

694
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,480
To protect his family,

695
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,030
he had written down
all the Chancellor's crimes.

696
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,320
The day before his death,

697
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,030
he sent it to a trusted servant.

698
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,630
Today, the servant received this letter.

699
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,070
This letter can't be forged.

700
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,590
It's written in a style
similar to yours.

701
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,920
Zheng Yuan must've learned
your handwriting, right?

702
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,710
Now that the evidence is clear,

703
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,670
what more can you say?

704
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,990
Your Majesty,

705
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,570
I've been cautious and careful,

706
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,190
supporting you for so many years.

707
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,190
How can you trust

708
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,960
Jun Qiluo's words over mine?

709
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
Had I known this,

710
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,650
I should've let her die in Beixuan,

711
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,110
so she wouldn't have the chance
to sway you.

712
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,960
Everything has gone wrong.

713
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,230
I treated you well,

714
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,550
yet you remain
unrepentant and insatiable.

715
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,760
How sinister

716
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,150
you are.

717
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,230
Spread my order:

718
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,710
Song Wei is guilty of treason.

719
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,960
He shall be imprisoned
in the Heavenly Prison

720
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,190
and executed.

721
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
All his ill-gotten wealth
will be confiscated.

722
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,640
Your Majesty,

723
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,630
Miss Jun and Xuan Lie

724
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,630
captured Song Wei by mobilizing

725
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,400
the Royal Surveillance.

726
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,230
Xuan Lie is still waiting outside

727
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,710
with the Beixuan envoy's documents.

728
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,440
Jun Qiluo,

729
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,320
how dare you mobilize the Surveillance
without my permission

730
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,840
and repeatedly involve outsiders

731
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,970
in meddling with Yannan politics?

732
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,750
The Jun family needs to be punished.

733
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,550
Guards, take her away.

734
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,640
Yes.
